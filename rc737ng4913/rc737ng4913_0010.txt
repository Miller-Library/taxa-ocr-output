was highly variable in this group of samples. Station 1
animals which were collected very close to the outfall
were relatively large (30-35mm) but had no developed
ovaries and no ovigerous lamellae. Animals from stations
2,4, and 5 were smaller (25-30mm) but almost all had
developed ovaries and ovigerous lamellae were often present.
Animals from station 3 were small and half of them had
developed ovaries. There were also ovigerous lamellae
present. The stalk fluid from all these animals (stations
1-5) was bright orange. The amount of pigment in the stalk
fluid was lowest in animals from station 1 and comparable to
the level of pigment in the animals from station P at Point
Pinos (Fig. 3). The stalk fluid pigment levels in
animals from stations 2,3, and 5 were highest compared to
all the offshore samples at Carmel, and were close to the
levels found at station B at Point Pinos. Compared with
2, 3, and 5, the pigment level in station l animals was
low. The pigment in the ovaries was lowest at station 1.
The ovary pigment levels at 2 and 3 were approximately
1.5 times the level at station 1. The levels in the ovaries
at 4 and 5 were approximately 2 times this level (Fig. 1).
Astaxanthin was most abundant in animals from stations
1 and 5, amounting to 53% and 55% respectively. These
astaxanthin levels are about 10% lower than those found
at Point Pinos. B-carotene was most abundant at station
2, amounting to 59%. Lutein was most abundant at stations
3 and 4, amounting to 61% and 59% respectively.
