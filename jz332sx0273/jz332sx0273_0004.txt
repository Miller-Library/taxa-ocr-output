chemical messengers (in the ink) ... would be more effective in the
darkness of night or at great depths."
Several studies have concentrated on the melanogenesis pathway
within the cells of the ink sac (Giroud, 1882; Szabo et. al. 1962, 1963).
However, surprisingly little is known regarding the presence of potential
chemical messengers within cephalopod ink itself. Prota et al. (1981)
found evidence for the presence of the enzyme tyrosinase in the ejected
ink of various cephalopods, including Loligo opalescens. They speculated
that this enzyme, which mediates the conversion of tyrosine to melanin.
is responsible for the olfactory chemosensory properties of the ejected
ink.
Many such potential chemical messengers might be present within
cephalopod ink. One plausible mechanism for their presence involves
necritic melanocytes. These cells have been observed to be shed directly
into the lumen of the ink sac (Ortonne et al., 1981). It is entirely possible
that these old, dead cells then break apart, and thereby introduce a wide
variety of amino acids (as well as the enzymes of cellular machinery) into
the ink.
In light of these findings, a chemical analysis devoted to identifying
and quantifying potential messenger compounds becomes logically neces-
sary. Such an analysis would be pertinent to a wide range of investigaÂ¬
tions. These might include:
1) Behavioral studies on cephalopod communication,
2) Ecological studies on predator-prey interactions.
3) Neurological studies on chemoreception and motor
pathways.
