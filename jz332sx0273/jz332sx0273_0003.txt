INTRODUCTION
Inking by cephalopods has long been recognized as an adaptive
response to predation and physical threat. The ink clouds produced by
these animals allow for retreat from a threatening situation and leave
behind either a diffuse "smoke screen" or a dense, long-lasting, decoy
that serves to confuse predators. Additionally, ink clouds may alert con¬
specitics to danger, especially within the dense schools of certain cepha¬
lopods such as squid. However, the visual nature of such communication
would limit its usefulness under conditions of little or no illumination.
Why then, do stressed squid eject ink at night and also at great depths?
(Fox, 1974)
One answer may be that cephalopod ink contains chemical compounds
which provide defensive "counter-attack" capabilities against predators.
MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1964) have suggested that octopus ink can
paralyze the olfactory senses of a formidable predator, the moray eel.
Additionally, squid ink has been shown to depress the appetites of certain
reef fish (DOOLITTLE, 19??). These studies indicate that, in addition to
melanin pigments, cephalopod ink probably contains chemicals which pos¬
sess neuroactive capabilities. However, none of these putative chemical
signals has been identified.
If such neuroactive compounds are present in ink, they need not ne¬
cessarily act upon predators only. Gilly and Lucero (1992) have shown
that crude squid ink stimulates high-pressure jet escape responses in the
squid Loligo opalescens, and that I-dopa, a likely component of the ink, can
mimic this action. They suggest that "although the color of ink could
serve as a visual alarm signal under conditions of sufficient illumination,
