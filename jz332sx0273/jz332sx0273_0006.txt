HPLC APPARATUS AND MATERIALS
Chromatography was performed with two Waters pumps connected to
a Waters Model 720 System Controller programmed to generate a dual¬
solvent, stepped-elution profile. Peaks were detected by a Flouro-Tec
digital filter flourometer with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an
emission wavelength of 450 nm. Peak areas were integrated by a Waters
Data Module. Separation of OPA-derivatized primary amines was perfor-
med on an Utrasphere 3 um Octadecasilane (ÖDS) column of 75 mm length
and 4.5 mm internal diameter.
A combination of aqueous and non-aqueous solvents was used to
create an elution profile with a total run time of 23 minutes. The
aqueous solution (solvent A) was 150 mM sodium acetate in 90% water,
9.5% methanol, and 0.5% tetrahydrofuran (THF). Prior to the addition of
methanol and THF, the pH was brought down to 7.20. The non-aqueous
solution (solvent B) was 100% methanol. All solvent materials were
either HPLC-grade or were passed through a 0.2 um Millipore filter prior
to use.
A modified stepped-elution profile was developed (Table 1) that
allowed for the clear separation and signal-integration of I-dopa and
dopamine at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The time course for solvent B was
as follows: constant 10% from 0 to 1 minute, linear increase to 20% from
1 to 4 minutes, constant 20% from 4 to 9 minutes, linear increase to 50%
from 9 to 13.5 minutes, constant 50% from 13.5 to 19 minutes, linear
increase to 90% from 19 to 21 minutes, linear decrease to 10% from 21 to
