curves will allow us to make more meaningful conclusions regarding any
variation within the mean concentrations themselves.
The high variability of these means points to the second area of our
investigation which requires more work: our sampling technique. Due to
the rapid oxidation of both I-dopa and dopamine, it is imperative that we
üse fresh, rather than frozen, ink. By so doing, we would eliminate most
of the uncertainty associated with the standard deviations of these
means. We would then be free to ascribe such variance to natural varia¬
tion among individuals, rather than to the effects of differential oxida¬
tion. In addition, by using the micro-capillary technique to collect enough
ink from each squid, we could analyze individuals separately, and thus ex¬
tend our investigation to an analysis between individuals,
The third area requiring more work is the quantification of other po¬
tential chemical messengers. This promises to be relatively easy, since
these compounds are stable amino acids. They conjugate well with the
flourescent label OPA and they do not break down into other compounds.
Thus, the integration of their peaks is highly reproducible, and the genera¬
tion of standard curves with low errors of slope is virtually quaranteed,
Finally, we feel that this investigation should expand slightly in order
to make full use of HPLC analytic capabilities. A quantification of I-dopa
within ink extracted manually from ink sacs does little more than to esta
blish an upper limit to the potential concentrations of this compound in
the ejected ink and in the water column.
We propose to measure the rate of oxidative decay of both I-dopa and
dopamine within various volumes of natural seawater and/or within vari¬
ous time periods. Such an analysis would yield highly relevant, biological
