and whole ink was manually recovered.
While it was important to maximize the amount of ink collected from
each sac, it was equally important to minimize pollution of the ink by the
cellular products from damaged melanocytes. A procedure for extracting
the ink without homogenizing the ink sac had to be developed. Various
methods involving hypodermic needles were attempted, but these were
less than satisfactory due to the viscosity of the ink. The solution, we
found, was to use sterile micro-capillary pipettes.
INK COLLECTION TECHNIQUE
A dissected ink sac was placed on a sheet of parafilm and a small cut
was made through the wall of the sac near the ink duct. A glass rod (fa¬
bricated by melting over the small end of a Pasteur pipette) was then used
to slowly force the ink out of the sac and onto the parafilm. One end of a
micro-capillary tube was introduced into the pool of ink and held there
until it was about half-full. More tubes were used until all the ink was
collected. Nitrogen gas was then used to gently blow the ink out of the
tubes and into a pre-weighed Eppendorf vial which contained 1 ml of 150
mM sodium acetate and 10 mM ascorbic acid. This procedure allowed us to
quickly collect and weigh most of the ink within an ink sac, and simulta¬
neously dissolve it in a solution containing an anti-oxidant, thereby mini¬
mizing the risk of oxidation. It also avoided overt damage to the ink sac,
and thus minimized the risk of pollution.
STORAGE AND ANALYSIS OF INK
Due to equipment difficulties and a scarcity of live squid, we were
forced to store the collected ink for later analysis. In order to prevent
