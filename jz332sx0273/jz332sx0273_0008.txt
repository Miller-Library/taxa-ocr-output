Samples awaiting injection were also bubbled, then stored at 0° C. All
samples for standard curves were injected within six hours of prepara¬
tion.
Chemicals used were of the highest purity available (Sigma ACS Rea¬
gent Grade or better) except for sodium bicarbonate, which was of Cell
Culture Grade and which contained an unidentified amino acid (retention
time = 5.9)
Our standard curves were established over the range of injections
that produced the best-integrated peaks. The I-dopa curve (Figure 2) is
based upon 7 samples from one 50 uM concentration (50, 60, 70, 80, 90.
100, and 110 ul injections). The dopamine curve (Figure 3) is based upon
10 samples: 5 samples from each of two separate 100 uM concentrations
(60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 ul injections). All injections within each set of
samples were analyzed consecutively. Each curve was estimated by linear
regression.
The standard curves established the sensitivity of detection and inte
gration for each compound. They were used to transform the integrated
peak areas, which resulted from each analysis of ink, into absolute nano-
molar quantities. For each individual ink sample, various injection
volumes yield various peak areas. These peak areas are then converted
into molar amounts with the aid of the appropriate standard curve. Ideal¬
ly, the molar amounts should converge upon one value. This value repre¬
sents our measurement of the amount of compound per mass of ink in that
particular sample.
BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS
Live specimens of Loligo opalescens were collected in Monterey Bay,
California. Squid were decapitated, ink sacs were removed by dissection
