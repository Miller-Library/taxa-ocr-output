oxidation, vials of collected ink were placed within a 50 ml centrifuge
tube. The top was sealed with parafilm, and an hypodermic needle was
used to inject nitrogen gas. A second hole in the parafilm allowed all of
the air originally within the tube to escape. The lid was then screwed
down over the parafilm and the entire collection was stored at -70° C.
Prior to analysis, each vial was quickly thawed and vortexed. The
vial was then centrifuged for 10 minutes (in a cold room) so as to produce
a dense pellet of ink granules. Of the available 1.0 ml, 900 ul of clear
supernatant were removed and centrifuged in 0.2 um filter tubes for about
45 seconds. The filtered ink extract was then prepared for injection.
Typically, a 100 ul sample was conjugated with 25 ul OPA for a 100
ul injection. The shape and size of the resultant peaks guided the selec-
tion of the next injection volume. Volumes were chosen so as to obtain
well-integrated peaks. Table 2 displays these volume selections for all
samples analyzed. Whenever possible, replicates were injected at one
particular volume in order to establish a measure of our "injection error“.
SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
Due to early difficulties in extracting the ink from each sac, we were
forced to pool individual ink sacs in order to obtain a measurable amount
of ink. (Later, as we developed the micro-capillary technique, we were
able to collect virtually all the ink within a sac without overtly damaging
the sac itself.) Thus, each sample included ink collected from 2 or 3
individuals of the same sex. Four separate samples were analyzed. As can
be seen from Table 2, the smallest mass of ink was 13.30 mg (collected
from 2 males) while the largest mass of ink was 32.91 mg (collected from
3 males).
