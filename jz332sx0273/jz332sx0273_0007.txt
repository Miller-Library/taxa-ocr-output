23 minutes. At 23 minutes, the initial conditions were re-attained and
the column was ready for the next injection.
In order to protect the column from particulate pollution, all samples
were passed through a 0.2 um Millipore filter prior to injection. Derivi¬
tization was carried out by adding 25% OPA by volume to the injection
sample (for instance: 250 ul OPA to 1000 ul of sample). We note in pas¬
sing that between uses, OPA must be kept sterile, refrigerated, and out of
the light. The derivatized samples were then vortexed briefly and spun in
a centrifuge for 1 minute. Volumes of supernatant, ranging from 10 ul to
a maximum of 1000 ul, were injected for analysis within 3 minutes of
derivitization. Criteria for the acceptance of signal integration included
both peak shape and peak size, and followed those spelled out by the
Walker Data Module Manual.
STANDARD CURVES
L-dopa and dopamine were dissolved in a solution of 150 mM sodium
bicarbonate and 10 mM ascorbic acid. Prior to the addition of ascorbic
acid, the solution was slowly brought to a pH of 10.4. Ascorbic acid is an
anti-oxidant, and was absolutely essential for inhibiting the oxidation of
both I-dopa and dopamine. Sodium bicarbonate buffered the solution so
that the final pH was 10.0. At this pH both I-dopa and dopamine readily
dissolved. Initial concentrations for both compounds were 1mM. These
were each diluted once to produce final working concentrations of 50 uM
for I-dopa and 100 uM for dopamine. These concentrations yielded sharp
signal peaks which could be well-integrated by the Walker Data Module.
In order to prevent oxidation during preparation, all solutions were
bubbled with N2 gas (purity = .99995) before and after each dilution.
