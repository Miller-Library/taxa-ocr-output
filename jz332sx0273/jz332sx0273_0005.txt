There are two principal justifications for our selection of primary
amines as the class of compounds for which to search. The first is based
on the cytology of the cephalopod ink sac. If one accepts the Raper-Mason
pathway of melanogenesis (Figure 1), at least up to the formation of dopa
chrome (Prota, 1988), one might expect that necritic melanocytes can
introduce the primary amines tyrosine, I-dopa, and dopaquinone into the
ink of cephalopods. Additionally, albeit through a completely separate
pathway, I-dopa can be converted into dopamine and thence into norepi¬
nephrine. Thus, one might expect these primary amines to be present as
well. The second justification is based upon behavioral studies which
demonstrated that millimolar concentrations of I-dopa mimicked high-
pressure, jet escape responses in living squid (Gilly and Lucero, 1992).
We thus decided to perform a chemical analysis on squid ink from
Loligo opalescens, using HPLC fractionation for primary amines, in an
attempt to quantify I-dopa, dopamine, and whichever amino acids might
consistently be present. Behavioral investigations could then be conduc¬
ted using these biologically-relevant concentrations of potential chemical
messengers.
