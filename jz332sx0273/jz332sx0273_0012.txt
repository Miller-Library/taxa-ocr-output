QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Table 3 lists the mean concentrations of I-dopa and dopamine present
).40
in squid ink. For I-dopa we report a mean concentration of 129 (+/- 0.43)
nanomoles per milligram of extracted ink. For dopamine we report a mean
O.1
concentration of 0.70 (+- 4 nanomoles per milligrams of extracted
A e
ink. We conclude that -dopa is present at a significantly higher concen¬
0.05
tration than dopamine (2-05 » P » 0.92).
In the last column of this same table, we report a coefficient of vari¬
ation for the slope of each standard curve: 8.2% for I-dopa and 9.0% for do¬
pamine. These values are relatively high for standard curves, and reflect
the low r2 for each regression: .967 for I-dopa and .939 for dopamine,
(Figures 2 and 3).
The means were calculated from 4 separate samples. Table 2 displays
these sample values. For dopamine, only one analysis per sample was
done. (Excepting Vial C, in which both concentrations are virtually identi¬
cal.) For I-dopa, however, numerous analyses were performed on each
sample. Thus, the mean concentration reported for I-dopa is actually a
mean of means.
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
In the course of quantifying l-dopa and dopamine, we were able to
identity a tew other primary amines which also are present in squid ink,
However, we were unable to quantify these compounds. In Table 4 they are
