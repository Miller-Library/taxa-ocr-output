concentrations with which one could more accurately measure the neuro¬
active potential of these compounds.
In conclusion, the results of this study are encouraging. Both I-dopa
and dopamine are present in frozen squid ink in measurable amounts, and
techniques were developed which promise to assist greatly the more ac¬
curate quantification of these and other potential chemical messengers
within the ink of Loligo opalescens.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors would like to thank Dr. Richard Zimmerman for both his
generosity in allowing us the use of the Alberte Lab HPLC equipment, as
well as for his invaluable assistance providing instruction in its use. We
would also like to thank Taylor Liu for obtaining live squid, and we are ap
preciative of Jimmy Lucero's efforts both in maintaining them and in di¬
recting their dissection. Finally, we are grateful to the fishing commu¬
