ABSTRACT
Potential chemical cues in squid ink were identified and quantified
using high-performance, reverse-phase, liquid chromatography (HPLC),
Primary amines in squid ink were conjugated with the flourescent com¬
pound ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). Upon separation by the column.
I-dopa and dopamine were detected by an end-column flourometer. Crude
ink was manually extracted from the dissected ink sacs of freshly-killed
Loligo opalescens collected from Monterey Bay, California. Protocols for
preventing the oxidation of the active compounds were developed, thereby
allowing for the storage of ink for later analysis. Fresh ink was never
analyzed. Standard curves were established for both I-dopa (r2 = ,967:
CV of slope= 8.2%) and dopamine (r2 = .939; CV of slope = 9.0%). These
standard curves were used to transform the integrated peak areas from
the HPLC analysis into absolute quantities. Ten ink sacs, collected from 8
adult males and 2 adult females, were used to create four discrete sam¬
ples for analysis. For l-dopa we report a mean concentration of L39
(+- 0.43) nanomoles per milligram of extracted ink. For dopamine we re¬
port a mean concentration of C698 (+- 0-02) nanomoles per milligram of
o.
