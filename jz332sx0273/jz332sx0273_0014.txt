DISCUSSION
Numerous reports have speculated on the presence of neuroactive
compounds within the ink of cephalopods. To our knowledge, this study
marks the first attempt at identifying, let alone quantifying, any of these
potential chemical messengers. While it is evident that HPLC analysis, as
a technique, shows great promise for this type of investigation, the confi¬
dence with which we report our results is less than satisfactory. We feel
that with some important modifications, this study should be continued
and expanded.
Ihree areas within our investigation require more work. The first of
these is the generation of standard curves. The low r2 for the linear re¬
gressions are due, in part, to the peculiar peak shapes generated by dopa
mine, and to a smaller extent, by I-dopa (Figure 5). The large, asymmetric
"shoulders" tend to confuse the integrator since any reduction in slope is
often interpreted as a return to baseline. Thus, the peak signal integra¬
tions, for dopamine especially, are highly variable, even for identical in¬
jection volumes. We are confident that this problem is resolvable.
By programming the Walker Data Module to halt integration of the do¬
pamine peak at a particular point within the latter part of its "shoulder",
the variability of integration from standard to standard should be reduced,
This, in turn, will allow for a linear regression of better fit. While the
slope of the line may not change, the standard deviation of the slope wil
be reduced. Thus, our mean concentrations may not be altered directly.
but the confidence with which we report them will be greatly increased,
Referring to Table 3, lower coefficients of variation for the standard
