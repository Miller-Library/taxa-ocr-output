Mortality per day was computed for each of eight
intervals between counts. The means of these rates and
their 95% confidence limits are presented in Table 1.
A students t-test for significance indicated that
mortality per day of the group fed on
gre
a was sig-
Ificantly different from all groups except the group
fed on a mixed diet. The highest mortality per day,
observed in the group fed exclusively on Phyllo
adix was
ificantly different from all groups except the group
si
fed on Iridaea.
Growth of the animals during the period of observation
is represented in Figure 3 and expressed as mean dry weight
with 95% confidence limits. The weight at the beginning
is included and labeled source group. A students t-test
for significance indicated that mean weight of the group
fed on Egre
ia was significantly different from all groups
except the group fed on a mixed diet. The group fed on
a mixed diet was significantly different from all remain¬
ing groups. The groups fed on Laminaria and Iridaea showed
a significant increase in weight over the source group.
However, no such significant gain in weight was observed
with the group fed on Phyllospadix.
1i Experiments on Adults
Twelve quart jars were set up as aquaria, with
vigorous aeration and maintained at ambient ocean temper¬
ature in a greenhouse. Weighed amounts of Egregia,Phyllo,Lridaea,
and Pelvetia were added to groups of three jars respective¬
ly. One jar in each group received four isopods weighing
