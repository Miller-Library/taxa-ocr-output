between .04 and .16 grams. Similarly one jar in each
food group received one isopod between .71 and .78 grams.
and one jar received one isopod whose weight was between
1.3 and 1.9 grams.
The initial net weights of plants and isopods were
obtained by blotting them with paper towels, and preventing
further weight change during weighing by placing them
in tared, covered petri dishes.
The animals were allowed to feed on the plant
material and at intervals of 4 to 8 days both plant and
isopod were weighed again. Fresh weighed plant material
was introduced at thede times. This was continued for one month.
Deterioration of the plants was not found to be
a problem under the cond
tions of the experiment. Plant
growth was considerable during these intervals. Controls
for the assessment of plant growth in the absence of
isopods were established. A figure of mean per cent
weight gain per day was calculated for each plant species. This
figure was used to estimate the plant growth that should
have occured in a jar during the grazing interval.
Weight
decrease in the plant over a grazing interval plus
probable
growth gave the amount of food ingested. Variance in
plant growth necessarily contributed to variance in
values for food ingested. Dry weight to wet weight
sios were obtained for the plants. Food ingested was
converted to dry weight, and expressed in terms of grams
dry weight of the food per gram wet weight of the animals
per day. The results are presented in Figure 4.
