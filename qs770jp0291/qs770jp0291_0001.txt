Introduction
Idot
Pent
otea ster
ops (Benedict) is an herb¬
ivorous isopod with a range from Coos Bay, Oregon to
Monterey,California (Menzies, 1950). It is found in
the lower littoral region, uncovered only by "minus'
sides. The vast majority of the population resides on
gregia, although occasional specimens may be found on
aminariaor
Yllospadix.
Preliminary studies of gut contents revealed a diet
consisting almost entirely of Egregia. Small amonts of
lospadix and Laminaria, and other forms of algae,
mostly epiphytes, have been found in the gut contents
of specimens examined.
The lower intertidal has a rich variety of flora
(Smith,1966), most of which I.S
enops is apparently
ignoring. There are considerable differences among
these plants in terms of cell wall composition, stor¬
age products, etc. perhaps important to their suitabil¬
ity as a food source (Kreeger, 1962) (Meeuse, 1962). The
research presented investigates how well I. Stenops is
able to utilize Egregia, and several other plants which
do not appear to be its normal food source.
