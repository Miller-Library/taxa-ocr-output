I Experiments on Newborn Animals
Two dozen ovigerous females were placed in an aquarium
with Egregia. After two days approximately two hundred
newborn animals were collected.
A random sample of 15 newborn animals was dryed at
60' C and weighed. Standard deviation in weighing was
O.11 mg.
Five aquaria in the form of plastic boxes had been
set up previously to hold these newborn isopods. These
plastic boxes, of slightly less than 1 gallon capacity,
were given running sea water and vigorous aeration. Four
boxes contained Egr
egia, Phyllospadix, Iridaea, and Lamin-
ria respectively as sole food source of the newborn. The
fth aquarium contained all four plants in equal amounts.
In each case an abundance of food was provided. The plant
species chosen served to contrast Egregia with another brown
alga, a red alga, and a flowering plant.
Croups of newborn I. sten
were counted and placed
in their respective aquaria.
Counts of the animals were made at intervals of not
more than seven days. At each count the groups and their
algae were placed in clean aquaria.
After thirty-four days the surviving animals were
arved for twenty-four hours to empty their guts, dryed
at 609 C, and weighed.
Mortality during the thirty-four days is presented
in figures 1-2.
