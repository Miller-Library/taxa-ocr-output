These mean ingestion rates were tested for significant
difference by a non-parametric test of the sum of the
ranks of differences between data pairs (Snedecor, 1967).
The test is appropriate to the data because of the large
variances. The ingestion rate on Egred
gia was significantly
ifferent from the rates on Phyllos
spadix and Iridaea,
but not the rate for
Pelvetia. All other rates are sigÂ¬
nificantly different from one another.
Fecal material was collected at intervals of two
to four days so as to avoid fouling of aquaria, and loss
of fecal material by decomposition. Fecal material was
measured as dry weight. The difference between dry weight
of ingested food and dry weight of fecal material was
considered as an estimation of assimilation, and expressed
as grams dry weight assimilated per gram isopod per day.
Standard deviation in weighing plants was approximately
25 milligram. Weighings were made to the hundredth of
a gram.
Standard deviation in weighing the animals was
approximately 13 milligrams. Weighings were made to the
nearest milligram.
The mean assimilation rates are presented in Figure 5
h95% con
wit
fidence limits. The same non-parametric test
was employed to determine significant differences between
pairs of means. The as
similation rate with Phyllospadix
is significantly dif
rent from the rate on all other diets.
No other significant differences were noted. It was
noted, however, that there was an apparant lack of vigor
