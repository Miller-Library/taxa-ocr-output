Discussion
Newoorn 1. stenops were good subjects for the study
of growth and mortality in relation to diet. They were
exceptionally homogeneous in weight as well as age.
They could be expected to show rapid growth if developing
properly. The dietary response of these young animals
night show differences from the response of mature adults.
and, therefore, be an important consideration.
The data on newborn growth indicates that the diets
can probably be ranked in decreasing quality as, Egregia,
Laminaria, Iridaea, Phyllospadix. This agrees with data
from the feeding of adults in terms of ingestion, assimilÂ¬
ation, and molting. The data on ingestion is especially
interesting since statistically significant differences
were found between the brown algae, and Irid, and Phyllospadix.
Onfortunately the large variance makes statistical
comparisons more di
icult for assimilation.
The wide confidence limits on means for ingestion
and assimilation are a reflection of the fact that feeding
was intermittent on all diets. In particular very little
feeding was done during molting periods. Nevertheless
the range embraced by the confidence limits indicates that
aximum values are much higher on brown algae tested than on
the red alga, Iridaea, and on either of the former than on
llospadix.
The relatively small differences in growth and survival
between newborn fed on Laminaria and Egregia are interesting
