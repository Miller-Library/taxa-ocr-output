since Laminaria is in fact found in the gut contents of
leld specimans, and I. stenops are occasionally found
grazing on it. The data indicatesthat it is only slightly
less suitable than Egregia as a food source.
All in all the data indicates that Egregia is a
significantly better food source than I
daea or Phyllospadix.
Such food specialization could certainly be a factor in
1. stenops distribution, and habitat choice. While the
data seems to indicate that brown algae has the most food
value to I. sten
ps the data on relative food values of
The brown algae is less conclusive. It does suggest th

ia is the most suitable food. The results fron
experiments on newborn animals seem to eliminate th
possibility that a mixture of the plants
to Egregia alone.
