INTRODUCTIO
For many years cities around the Monterey Bay
have been dumping their sewage into the ocean, but
no one has studied the biological significance of this
In an attempt to study some effects of sewage. I used
narine embryos, since developmental processes are
sensitive to environmental factors. <span style='background-color:grey' title='Dendraster excentricus : Fuzzy'>Dendraster

rate of development by timing morphological changes
and measuring lengths of skeletons. The sewage didn't
seem to harm the embryos in dilutions less than 5%.
In fact, they often grew slightly better in 1% sewage
than in sea water. However, development was either
slower or abnormal in 5g and greater sewage concen-
trations. Several other factors, including the temp-
erature, type of container, concentration of embryos,
and natural variation of eggs, were also found to effect
the rate of development.
ETHOD
he adult sand dollars and sea urchins were
ollected and kept in an aquarium with sea water and
aeration. Shedding of gametes was induced by intra-
coelemic injection of O.5M KCl. Eggs were collected
y setting the animal over a beaker filled with sea
water; sperm were collected "dry" with a pipett.
he eggs were washed three times with sea water by
jecantation and resuspension. They were fertilized
addition of one or two drops of sperm suspension
one drop of sperm fluid in 10ml. sea water.) (1,3)
then transferred the embryos to small perti
dishes or flasks which contained sewage dilutions. SAt
different intervals they were examined microscopicall,
or general morphological attributes. To measure the
ate of skeleton growth, I removed a few drops from
each culture, placed them on a depression slide, and
added several drops of Clorox. After about a minute
the skeletons could be measured. I always measured th
distance from the top to the end of the postoral arm.
(Figure 1
To keep the temperature constant, I placed the
etri dishes on a tray which floated on the sea table
water. The temperature remained between 15 and 18°c.
Several times I changed the water in the petri dishes
of the older plutei. This was done by removing about
half the water with a syringe, avoiding the embryos,
and adding fresh water or dilutions of sewage. Daily
the plutei were fed one or two drops per petri dish
of algae from a culture obtained from Ralph Hine-
gardner. (These same algae are known to sustain sea
urchin embryos through netamorphosis. (4) Where
antiblotic solutions were used, streptomycin and pen-
cillen were added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
The sewage was obtained from the Honterey treat
each.
ment plant. The algae were grown in a medium which
was half the concentration described by Guillard and
Ryther. (2
ESUITS
The stages of development were defined in terms
of gross morphological changed. These are shown in
gures 2, 3, and 4. The first stages (71-14) are sim
lar to those described by Karnofsky and Simmel. (5)
The times of the first cleavages were not
effected by the sewage. No effects from sewage were
observed for about ten hours, after which retarded
development or abnormalities were seen in 5% and 10%
sewage. (Figures 5,6) The abnormal embryos were of
varying shapes and were darker than controls. They
didn't die, but remained approximately the same size
and continued to swim for several weeks
In one trial run using sand dollars I observed
that chlorinated sewage from Pacific Grove had a greater
effect than unchlorinated Nonterey sewage. Thus,
in a 10% dilution, the eggs never divided. In exper
iments with sea urchins and starfish gametes a relat-
vely low concentration of chlorine can completely block
fertilization. (7,9)
To determine the rate of development more
precisely, I measured the skeleton lengths. Embryos
grown in 14 sewage grew slightly faster than those in
sea water, but those in 5% and greater sewage dilutions
showed harmful effects. (Figure 7) The skeleton lengths
varied with each set of cultures, but the average length
was shorter in 5% sewage than in sea water. (Figures

ments to see if the groups were significantly different.
The skeletons from 14 sewage were statistically either
the same or longer than those from sea water. (In one
case they were shorter, however.) But after they had
been growing for 100 hours, the skeletons were longer
in the sea water controls. The embryos from 2% sewage
were never consistantly different from those in sea
water. (Figure 11)
My observations point to some experimental
conditions that must be kept constant in order to
observe sewage effects. First, the embryos should not
be too crowded. The type of container is significant.
The embryos died after a week in 125ml. flasks, but
hey survived in the petri dishes. Temperature and ph
must be constant. Addition of antibiotics did not
correlate with health or rate of development.
DISCUSSION
From my observations, I conclude tha concen-
trated sewage (5%) adversely effects the development
of embryos, but that lower concentrations may slightly
nhance growth, at least during the first 100 hours
The effects of temperature may also have
significance in field conditions. Thus, the temp.
erature around the outfall was found to be several degrees
higher. Also, the sewage contains organic and inorganic
nutrients which might be beneficial at low concentrations
explaining the initial slight enhancement in dilute
sewage. (8) Many factors, including various metals,
proteolytic enzymes, and dyes, are known to produce
exogastrulation, one of the abnormalities found in 5/
sewage. (5,6) The sewage may certainly contain some
of these factors. The osmotic differences in the higher
sewage concentrations may also have caused retardation.
Finally, the chlorine probably has strong effects. In
comparing development and fertilization, the latter is
a more sensitive process, particularly to chlorine.
Working with <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Pateria,</span> Rotkis found that once eggs were
fertilized, they reached the blastula stage, a result
which agrees with my data. (9) However, though the
embryos look normal, are all the systems working properly'
Will embryos raised in sewage be able to undergo meta-
morphosis? These questions suggest further research.
SUMIART
The effects of sewage on sand dollar and sea
urchin development were studied. Time required to reach
different morphological stages and rate of skeleton
growth were used as parameters. Studies were also
arried out on culture conditions necessary to raise
embryos beyond the pluteus stage. The development was
adversely effected by sewage if the concentration was
greater than 5% (unchlorinated.) A slight enhancement
was often observed in 14 sewage, åt leasthduring the
first 100chours.

giving me the algae he had cultured, and my roommate
Welanie MoCabe for bringing the culture from Santa Cruz.
