To collect the worms, a hollow metal cube with a volume of
15,625 cubic cm, enclosed on four sides and open at the top and bottom,
was pounded into the sand at intervals of 2 m throughout the length
of the transect. The cube was pushed into the sand until the upper
limits were flush with the surface of the sand. All the sand inside
the cube was then dug out and placed on a wire screen with holes
larger than the sand but significantly smaller than any organisms
living in the sand. Seawater was poured upon the screen to filter
the sand through it. After all the san was drained away, all the
orbiniids living in the sand remained scattered upon the screen. They
were then counted and recorded (fig. 2). Nine samples were taken.
The range was 7-94 worms per sample. The mean density was 27 orbiniids
per 15,625 cc.
When the worms eat was investigated by collecting worms at various
times during a 36-hr period, coinciding with a series of low tides.
Comparing volumes of fecal material from different times of day with
respect to tidal levels could disclose if there was periodicity in
their eating habits that conformed to the rise and fall of the tide.
Worms were collected at 6-hr intervals and at every low tide for a
36 hr period. Ten worms were obtained during each collection. Each
worm was brought to the laboratory within one-half hour after collection,
cleaned thoroughly of sand and mucous, and placed in a petri dish
partially filled with sea water. The worms seemed to defecate all of
their gut contents in 5-6 hours. The petri dishes were kept on a sea
table with running water for as much as 36 hours. The 36-hr collection
yielded ninety worms. The last thirty worms, however, were placed in
syracuse dishes rather than petri dishes. All of these worms died
before they had defecated completely; death was attributed to the
small size of the dishes. Only the first 60 fecal pellets (obtained
