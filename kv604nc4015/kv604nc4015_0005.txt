matter in the feces. This large variation justifies an analysis of the
percentages of organic matter in the fecal pellets at varying tide
levels. Such an investigation might offer an explanation for the
large percentages of organic detritus in some feces. Fig. 8 shows that
15 of the 16 fecal pellets with organic matter constituting more than
20 percent of the feces were collected during tide levels of 2 ft or
lower. Furthermore, the majority of these worms were collected during
an outgoing tide.
An examination of the size of the fecal pellets that have high
percentages of organic matter reveals that they are relatively large
in size (fig. 9). A breakdown of the feces by percentage of organic
composition shows that unidentifiable organic detritus accounts for most
of the increase in amount of organic matter (fig. 10).
To find out where in a column of sand the worms get their food
3 narrow aquaria, each 40 cm long, 40 cm deep, and 1.5 mm wide, were
filled with sand. One orbiniid was put in each aquarium with constantly
circulating sea water. The aquaria were placed in a darkroom lit
by a dim red light. Observations were made on the movements of the
thorax in two overlapping twelve hour shifts (fig. 11), in order to
determine vertical movement and hence food-getting behavior.
Discussion
The population density of the orbiniids is most highly concentrated
at 0.0 ft tidal level. Here they are found 27 per 15,625 cubic cm.
The worms are not in uniform concentrations but are clustered.
Food apparently becomes available on incoming high tides since
the guts are full at this time, even though there is a lack of statistical
significance to prove this (fig. 7). It is conceivable that the
incoming tide triggers their feeding response since high tide finds
