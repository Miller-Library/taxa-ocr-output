Figure 1: Map of a portion of Boatworks Beach, showing location of
Orbinia johnsoni.
Figure 2: Population density per 15,625 cmâ€™. Mean density: 27; range:
7 to 94; sample size: 9. The population is most highly concentrated
at around O foot tidal level.
Figure 3: Mean defecation over time compared to tide levels.: Solid
line: tide level; dotted line: mean defecation.
Figure 4: Mean defecation over time compared to tide levels. Solid
line: tide level; dotted line: mean defecation.
Figure 5: Defecation ratios compared to tide levels. V: the worm was
collected during an outgoing tide;A: the worm was collected during an
incoming tide.
Figure 6: Time for food to go through gut.
Figure 7: Detritus: feces compared to sand samples. A: sand; B: organic
detritus; C: diatoms; D: blue-green algae; E: bacteria.
Figure 8: Organic detritus (2) in feces at varying tide levels.
V: the worm was collected during an outgoing tide; A: the worm
was collected during an incoming tide.

volume. Each dot represents one fecal pellet.
Figure 10: Breakdown of feces by percentage of organic composition.
A: sand; B: organic detritus; C: diatoms; D: blue-green algae; E:
bacteria.
Figure 11: Positions of thorax in aquaria. Solid line: mean depth of
thorax along vertical axis, representing depth of sand; dotted line:
mean distance moved each hour. 0 - sand level.
