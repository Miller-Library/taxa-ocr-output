Introduction
Orbinia johnsoni (Moore, 1909) inhabits, according to Smith and
Carlton (1975) protected sandy beaches. This species is known from
Marin County to La Jolla, California, in both low intertidal and
subtidal locations. Hartman (1957) describes the worm as being
80-90 mm long, but the worms used in this study, after being relaxed
in magnesium chloride and preserved in formaldehyde, were found to
range from 161 to 225 mm, with a mean length of 190 mm.
Though the descriptions of Moore (1909) and Hartman (1957)
are full descriptions, they do not give any information on the
biology and feeding behavior of the orbinids. This study proposes
to contribute information on these two factors.
Two questions are raised. First, what is the population density
of the worms? Second, what is their feeding behavior? The latter
concern is further divided into four categories. First, when do they
eat? Second, how long does it take for food to travel through their
gut? Third, what do they eat? Fourth, where do they find their food?
Materials, Methods and Results
The population density of Orbinia johnsoni from the Boatworks
Beach (fig. 1) east of Mussel Pt., Pacific Grove, California, was
measured by taking a transect between 3.5 ft and -1.0 ft. tide level.
The worms were found between 3.1 ft. and -0.5 ft., seaward of a popÂ¬
ulation of Nerinides acuta (Spionidae). Only occasional Nephtys
californiensis (Nephtyidae) occurred with Orbinia. The sand grain
size on the beach is fairly homogeneous (+1-+20). The worms are
uncovered 3 to 4 days out of a monthly tidal cycle.
