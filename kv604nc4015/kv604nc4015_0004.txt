volume of worm were acquired by the same methods applied in the preceding
experiment. The means for each of the 8 sets of ten ratios was obtained
to arrive at 8 separate data points. The 80 fecal pellets were then
mounted on slides and preserved for later use.
The mean defecation over time does not appear to conform to tide
levels (fig. 4). Once again, ranges and standard deviations are very
large.
Comparing all 140 of the defecation ratios to tide levels in a
scatter diagram, where each fecal pellet's relative volume is represented
individually sheds more light on the extent to which feeding behavior
could be a function of tide (fig. 5). Here one notes low ratios
clustered about low tide levels and high ratios clustered about high
tide levels. Furthermore, primarily low ratios occur during outgoing
tides and mainly high ratios are found in incoming tides.
Determining how long it took for food to go through the worm's
gut was done by placing worms for one hour in petri dishes that were
partially filled with methylene blue stained sand. Then the worms were
cleaned off and moved to clean petri dishes filled partially with sea
water. The dishes wereplaced on a sea table and spot checked every
fifteen minutes for defecation of blue sand. Fig. 6 summarizes the
results of the four worms that did defecate the blue sand.
Discerning what the orbiniids ate was done by analyzing the
preserved fecal pellets retained from the earlier experiments. 170
slides were analyzed. These were compared to the composition of sand
samples from the orbiniids' habitat (fig. 7). The worms were found
to eat about 932 sand, 42 organic detritus, 12 diatoms and less than
1 percent of both blue green algae and bacteria. Not all the animals,
however, had extremely high percentages of sand in their fecal pellets.
Some had as low as 5 percent sand and as high as 95 percent organic
