from the first 24 hrs of collection), consequently, were used for
determining fullness of the guts. After 36 hours the fecal pellets were
removed from the petri dishes using a pipette. The volume of each
fecal pellet was measured by placing it in a graduated centrifuge
tube filled with sea water. The feces, mostly sand, would always
quickly settle to the bottom. The volume of each worm was measured
by the amount of water it displaced in the tube. A ratio was attained
for each worm's defecation by dividing the volume of the fecal pellet
by the volume of the worm after defecation. The mean for each of the
six sets of ten ratios was attained to arrive at six separate data
points. The fecal pellets were then mounted on slides and preserved
for later examination.
A comparison of attained volume feces/volume of worm ratios to
tidal cycles within the 24-hr period shows a parallel relation between
high ratios and high tides, in addition to the close relation between
low ratios and low tides (fig. 3). All of the data points, however,
have extremely wide ranges. Some of the ranges vary from 0.0 to 1.0.
The standard deviation for each of the data points is extremely large,
making the means statistically insignificant.
A follow-up study was conducted in search of further evidence
that might support the finding that orbiniids have full guts during
high tides and empty guts during low tides. Worms were collected
every three hours for a 24-hr period. Eight sets of ten worms, the
product of the collection, were placed individually in separate petri
dishes partially filled with sea water which were, in turn, kept on
a sea table. Again, this procedure was completed for each set of ten
worms within one-half hour after collecting them from the field.
They were left to defecate for 36 hours. Ratios of volume of feces/
