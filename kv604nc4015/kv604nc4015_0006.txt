them with their guts the fullets. It takes 3-3.5 hrs for food to pass
through the gut which is ample time for feeding during an incoming to
high tide, defecate during outgoing to low tide and be ready to feed
again for the next high tide.
Though the average worm appears to ingest sand either preferentially
or concurrently with other food (fig. 10), some worms showed upward
of 512 of their fecal contents (fig. 10) as being derived from
organic material. A possible explanation of this might be in being
near a pocket of decaying seaweed which commonly occur on this beach.
During outgoing tides the receding wave action has a tendency to leave
rows of wrack on the beach. This wrack could seep into the sand when
the tide is out and eventually provide a food source for the worms.
The worms are probably bottom feeders. In the field they were
never observed to be closer than 10 cm below the surface of the sand.
In aquaria their tendency was to go to the bottom and stay there.
Summary
Orbinia johnsoni were studied from a small sandy beach near Mussel
Pt., Pacific Grove, California, where they are most abundant at low
tide levels in fine sand. They were found to have a mean length of
190 mm.
The orbiniids were found with their guts the fullest during
incoming to high tides. It is plausible that this is when they are
feeding. It takes about 3 to 3.5 hrs for food to travel through the
length of the gut. The orbiniids eat 93 percent sand and seven percent
organic detritus. Special note should be taken that some food selectivity
appears to be involved and that high percentages of organic matter in
the feces are found in worms collected during low, outgoing tides.
Evidence suggests that the worms are bottom feeders, not coming to the
