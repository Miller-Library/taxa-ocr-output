twenty-four hour recovery period snails were tested with
NSW. No difference was noted in the extrusion response
between experimental (n=14) and control (n=6) groups.
Snails were then allowed to recover for an additional 24
hours, afterwhich half were tested with a dilution of 60
percent ASW and half with sodium D-gluconate. Response
to the dilution was slowed (n-3) or absent (n-4) among
the experimental group. Response was 100 percent among
the controls (n=3) and among snails previosly tested with
dilutions at and slightly below the 60 percent test solu¬
tion (n=13). No difference in response was noted between
experimental (n=7) and control (n=3) groups in response
to sodium D-gluconate. Thus, destruction of this region
does have an effect upon the snail's ability to deteot
salinity. At this point it is unclear why removal of
the dise should have little affect upon the detection
of NSW, but have a large effect upon the detection of
a dilution. Previous research (Kohn, 1961) also suggests
that this region is the primary site of detection in an¬
other species, Nodilittorina granulus (Gray).
In summary, Littorina planaxis has the ability to
determine the concentration of chloride in solution while
the snail is drawn into its shell with its operculum
closed. The calcium cation appears to have some small,
