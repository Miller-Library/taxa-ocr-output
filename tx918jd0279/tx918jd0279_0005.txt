group was anesthetized in magnesium chloride, cephalic
tentacles were removed, and the group was placed into
normal sea water for recovery. One control group followed
the same procedure except cephalic tentacles were not re¬
moved. The second control group was identical to the
other control group except it was not placed into mag-
nesium chloride. All three groups were placed into
distilled water for 30 minutes prior to testing with NSW.

OsO, in 0.5 M sodium acetate wasito visualize those
regions exposed to test solutions while the snail
remained drawn into its shell. Snails were exposed to
a stain either by placement of one drop of stain upon
the closed operculum, or by direct immersion of the
snail into the stain. Exposure time was varied. After
exposure, snails were washed with distilled water, placed
into isotonic magnesium chloride, and examined for stain¬
ed areas.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization
The snails response to solutions of varying salin¬
ities is summarized in figure one. The graph is plotted
as the percentage of positive sstage one) responses at a
given osmolality of a test solution. NSW is around 970
