ABSTRACT
The marine snail, Littorina planaxis, has the ability
to distinguish between solutions of high and low salinity.
Research indicates that salinity is determined primarily
through the detection of chloride. The region of deÂ¬
teotion seems to be localized in the area, between the
operculum and the foot, known as the operculigerous disc.
