The results of the anion replacement tests also
support the conclusion that Littorina planaxis responds
to the concentration of chloride. Solutions of sodium
chloride (n=8) and Tris HCl (n=6) both gave responses in
over 80 percent of the snails. Test solutions of sodium
D-gluconate (n=9), sodium phosphate (n=6), and Tris
citrate (n=12) gave no positive responses.
Localization
Mapping of the opercular region indicates that the
operculum itself is not sensitive to solutions of high
salinity. The extruding response does not occur unless
the solutions come into contact with the crack between
the operculum and the shell. Further localization was
achieved through staining experiments. In all cases (n=25)
the only stained region was the area lying between the
foot and the operculum, the operculigerous disc (Fretter &
Graham, 1962). Even after immersion of one hour in
methylene blue, no other areas showed signs of staining.
It should be noted that OsO)--Acetate stained similarly,
did not give a stage one response,did not kill the
snail.
Removal of the cephalic tentacles had no effect upon
the extruding response (n=10). Further operations were
performed by removing the operculigerous disc. After a
