mOsm. There are three possible methods that Littorina
qualita
planaxis might be using to determine the
surrounding solutions: detection of total osmotic pres¬
sure, deteotion of ionic strength, detection of one
specific ion.
Of the twenty snails tested with sucrose solutions
of 984 mOsm and 826 mOsm, all failed to give positive
responses. The osmolalities of the sucrose solutions
were well within a region that gave 100 percent posi¬
tive response with ASW and NSW. This result dees netsuppert
the possibility that the deteotion of salinity is through
the use of a general osmoreceptor.
Results from additions of specific ions to the
sub-threshold ASW dilution are summarized in figures two
and three. In figure two, the percentage of positive
responses is plotted against the percentage of a specific
cation's concentration relative to the concentration of
that cation found in ASW. A standard dilution curve for
ASW is given as a reference. No positive responses
ocourred with the dilution (arrow). If L. planaxis was
testing for one specific ion, the curve for that cation
should follow the dilution ourve of ASW closely. The
data suggests that the snails are not testing solely for
the calcium, magnesium, or potassium cation. The sodium
