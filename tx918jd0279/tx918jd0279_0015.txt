Figure Two
The percentage of positive responses is plotted
against the percent concentration of a specific cation
in the test solution as comparaed to its normal concen¬
tration in ASW. As an example, a 60 mM Cacl, test
solution yielded 25 percent positive response.
The normal
concentration of Cacl, in ASW is 10 mM. The respective
plot for this point is at (600,25). Activity coefficients
were not considered and are implied to be one at all di¬
litions. The arrow represents the ASW dilution (see also
text).
