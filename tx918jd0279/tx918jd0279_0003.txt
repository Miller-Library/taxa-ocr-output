aquaria for several hours before each experiment. No
snail was kept for more than 48 hours.
Artificial sea water contained Nacl (450 mM), Mgcl,
(50 mM), Cacl, (10 mM), KCI (10 mM), and Tris(hydroxy¬
methyl)aminoethane Hydrochloride (Tris HCl) buffer at
pH 7.8 (10 mM).
METHODS
Standard testing procedure
Each snail was removed from distilled water or from
desiccation and placed with its operculum up. The oper¬
culum was then covered with 20 microliters of a test solu¬
tion, and the snail's response noted. A stage one response
within two minutes was considered a positive response
whether or not full extrusion occurred. No difference
in response was ever noted between the two groups. No
snail was tested more than once and responses from a group
(4-2) of snails were combined to give a percentage of
positive responses. All snails giving negative responses
were then tested with artificial sea water (ASW) or natu¬
ral sea water (NSW) to make sure that the snails were
alive.
Characterization
To determine the range of salinities over which the
stage one response occurs, test solutions were made from
ASW or from NSW. Test solutions were also made by add¬
