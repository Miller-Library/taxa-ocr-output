the effeots of anions, the following solutions were com¬
pared: 0.5 M sodium chloride, 0.52 M sodium D-gluconate,
0.5 M Tris HCI, 0.5 M and 0.4 M Tris citrate. All solu¬
tions were adjusted to pH 7.8 with either 5 mM Tris HCI
buffer or NaOH. Non-electroyte test solutions con¬
tained sucrose adjusted to pH 7.8 with 10 mM Tris HCI
buffer.
Localization
Mapping of regions sensitive to saline solutions
was carried out by placing small amounts (1 to 5 micro¬
liters) of ASW or NSW on or around the operculum.
To determine the role of the cephalic tentacles in
the deteotion of salinity, it was necessary to remove
these organs from a group of snails. An aqueous solu¬
tion of magnesium chloride isotonic with NSW was used as
an anesthetic and relaxant (Peters, 1964). An immersion
of 15 to 20 minutes was usually adequate to allow for easy
removal of the tentacles. No long-lasting affeots of the
anesthetic were ever apparent, even after immersions of
two hours.
Thirty snails were divided into three groups, an ex¬
perimental group, and two control groups. The experimental
