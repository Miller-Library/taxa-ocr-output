ion is probably not the only stimulus for the extruding
response either. There may, however, be some sort of
summation of several ions to give a 100 percent positive
response.
No single cation gave 100 percent positive response
except for Ca". As explained previously, Ca
cannot be
preferentially deteoted since its threshold for positive
response is well above that found in NSW. A solution of
Nacl with 10 mM Cacl, gave a curve similar to that of
ASW. From this data either Na' or Cl appear to be pri¬
marily detected. Some concentration of Ca'* (between 2
and 10 mM) is needed for some snails to achieve a stage
one response. At this point it is not entirely clear
what the effeot of the calcium ion is.
The data in figure two can be replotted as the per¬
centage of positive response against the concentration
of the chloride anion (fig. 3). This graph shows a very
steep function where a small increase in the chloride
concentration results in a large increase in the per¬
centage of positive responses. As an example, the Ca
curve rises from no positive responses to 100 percent
positive response over only a 60 mM increase in chloride
concentration. This comes close to resembling an on-off
which
set point,
would be expected if salinity detection
involved chloride only
