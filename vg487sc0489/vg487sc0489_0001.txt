INTRODUCTION
Crepidula adunca (Sowerby, 1825), commonly known as
the slipper shell, is a protandric marine prosobranch
commonly found intertidally on the shells of the black
turban snail Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854). Its
range extends from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the
tip of Lower California.
Crepidula adunca females brood a mass of yolky eggs
until developed and will physically push the young into
the surrounding water (Putnam, 1964). The young lack
sexual organs and after a growth period develop a penis
and enter the male phase of their life cycle. At some
point, dependent partly upon environmental factors, the
Crepidula enter the female stage of their life cycle
(Coe, 1936). The male is typically found oriented on the
female shell which in turn is oriented on the T. funebralis
shell (Coe, 1953).
Crepidula adunca reportedly use a radula for rasping
algal films from rocks when young and switch to a filter-
feeding system as they mature into adults (Coe, 1948;
Abbott and Haderlie, 1980). The results of this investiÂ¬
gation suggest that in terms of feeding behavior, both
young and adults may be more labile than previously believed.
Newborn Crepidula adunca have a mean length of about
1.18 mm and are very similar to the adults in appearance.
Essentially nothing was known about the period of the
Crepidula life cycle between the time of dispersal and the
time of attachment to Tegula. Although newborn Crepidula
are about 1 mm in length, previous investigators (Putnam,
