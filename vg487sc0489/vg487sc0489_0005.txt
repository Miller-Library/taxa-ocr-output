food groove to the mouth was clearly observed in the newborn.
Similarly, although adults reportedly lose their ability
to feed by rasping, a definite scraping by the radula
of diatoms off of the slides was observed not only by the
young but also by both adult males and females.
After an interval of a week, the microhabitat which
had been constructed to resemble the sandy, shell-fragmented
habitat of the young, resulted in a clustering of newborn
Crepidula on the smallest gastropod shells available.
19 out of 20 were found on shells smaller than 8 mm in
length and no Crepidula were found attached to adult T
funebralis.
Examination of rock faces and crevices where adult
Crepidula are abundant yielded no Crepidula smaller than
4 mm in length. Examination of nearby sandy, shell-frag-
mented areas and sandy holdfasts of algae and Phyllospadix
revealed a number of small gastropod shells and Pagurus
in small gastropod shells with Crepidula attached which
ranged down to the 1 mm size of newborn Crepidula (Fig. 2). The
results of the distribution survey in the lower, sandy,
shell-fragmented habitats are shown in Fig. 3, in which
the number of host shells, host shells with Crepidula, and
host shells with Crepidula of 1 mm in length for each host
shell size class are shown. The abundance of small gastropod
shells and the clustering of the newly born Crepidula on
the smallest gastropod shells are apparent. The average
size of Crepidula found is 2.00 mm with a standard error of
.18. The average size of host shells with 1 mm Crepidula
attached is 3.90 mm with a standard error of .32. The average
