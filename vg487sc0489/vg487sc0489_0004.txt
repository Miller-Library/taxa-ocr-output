a male Crepidula in the center of a glass dish with, for
example, a live Tegula and a Tegula shell, at opposite
sides of the dish and examining the attachment of the male
Crepidula after 24 hours.
Experiments to examine the possible protection from
predation by attachment of Crepidula to a Tegula shell
were performed by placing 5 male Crepidula, 5 T. funebralis,
and 5 Pagurus in T. funebralis shells together in a glass
dish and observing survival rate of Crepidula over time.
ESULT
The motility experiments (Fig. 1) show that the young, which
although in body length are an average of 10 times smaller
than the females and 7 times smaller than the males, ex-
hibit greater movement over time than either the males or
females. The young show an average distance moved over
30 minutes of 3.18 cm, the adult males show an average
distance moved of 2.16 cm, and the adult females show an
average distance moved of 2.04 cm.
Desiccation experiments showed the young to be much
more vulnerable to desiccation than the adults. When placed
out of water, the young die within 15 to 20 minutes while
the adults are able to survive for several hours.
Observation of feeding behavior of the newborn indicate
that Crepidula adunca are born not only with the ability
to rasp but also with the capacity to filter-feed. Although
the food pouch does not develop until after the young adult
stage (Moritz, 1939), a mucus string travelling up the
