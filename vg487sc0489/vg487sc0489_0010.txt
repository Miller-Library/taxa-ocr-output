shape may be the cause of attraction of Crepidula for T.
funebralis and together with the selection of larger host
shells may result in the change of habitat to the rock
faces where Tegula are abundant.
Thus, the results of motility, desiccation, and micro-
habitat experiments as well as observations of feeding and
dispersal behavior harmonize well with the discovery of the
sandy, shell fragment habitats of young Crepidula adunca
below the neighboring rocky habitats of the adults and with
the observation that the young prefer small gastropod shells
as their hosts.
A marked difference in the behavior of the young in
subtidal populations may exist. Young Crepidula adunca
are reported to have been found on adult Tegula species
common to the subtidal region. This may possibly be due
to the difference in habitat conditions, such as the lessened
threat of desiccation in the subtidal areas, or possibly
even due to genetic differences between intertidal and
subtidal populations of Crepidula adunca. Although the
question of where intertidal Crepidula adunca go after
dispersal has been partially answered by this investigation,
a whole range of questions yet to be answered have arisen.
SUMMARY
The young of intertidal Crepidula adunca are dispersed
from the female and sink down into sandy, shell-fragmented,
lower habitats where they attach onto small gastropod
shells. As they outgrow the host shell, they move onto
