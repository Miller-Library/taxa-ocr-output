stand. The shell fragments and blades of algae characterisÂ¬
tic of the habitat of the young may provide protection
from strong water currents which might tend to tear the
young Crepidula away from the host shell. Putnam (1964)
found that newly dispersed young, because of their inability
to free swim, will fall off the host shell and sink. This
characteristic of the young would provide an effortless
means of transportation between the rock face habitat
of the adults and the sandy bottom habitat where the young
are found. The ability to both rasp and filter-feed indi-
cated in laboratory observations would grant the young
more flexibility in habitat choice.
The strong positive correlation between size of Crepi-
dula and size of host shell in the sandy habitat seems to
suggest that very small Crepidula will attach to a small
gastropod shell until it outgrows it, at which point it
will move on to a bigger host shell. At some point in its
life cycle, however, Crepidula seem to develop a strong
attraction for the Tegula funebralis and female Crepidula
shells and will settle down on one host for long periods
of time. This prolonged attachment of male and female
Crepidula of various ages would result in the wide range
of Crepidula sizes found on the adult T. funebralis shells
of the rocky habitats. The relatively high motility of
the young fits in well with the possibly higher rate of
host exchange of the young indicated in the laboratory.
The lack of attraction towards adult T. funebralis or
