and adult females over a 30 minute period.
Figure 2: Comparison of the habitat locations of young and adult

attached, and number of shells with Crepidula of 1 mm attached
for each host shell size class in the sandy habitats of the
young.

attached for each host shell size class in the rocky habitats
of the adults.

shell found in sandy habitats. Least squares linear regression
line is shown.
