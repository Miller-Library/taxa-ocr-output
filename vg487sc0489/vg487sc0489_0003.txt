to determine whether an animal was filter-feeding, it was
placed on a clean microscope slide, placed upside-down
in a shallow dish of water with a few drops of graphite
solution, and examined under the dissecting microscope
for the appearance of a graphite-blackened mucus string
travelling to the mouth up the ciliated food groove located
on the right neck lappet.
An artificial microhabitat was set up in the laboratory
by placing a layer of sand covered by shell fragments
and rocks in a large glass dish along with gastropods and
Pagurus in gastropod shells ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm in
length. 20 newborn Crepidula were added, and the micro-
habitat was left undisturbed for a week.
II. Field Studies
Areas of high adult Crepidula density and the surrounding
regions of the intertidal were examined for the presence
of young Crepidula. Distribution of Crepidula on hosts
of adult Tegula funebralis on rock faces was surveyed by
collecting each sample within a haphazardly placed quadrant
of area of 1 m2. Distribution of Crepidula on host gas-
tropod shells of sandy bottoms was surveyed by collecting
samples of approximately equal volumes from the bottom in
a metal scooper.
III. Attraction of Crepidula to T. funebralis
Preference tests were performed between live T. funeÂ¬
bralis and empty T. funebralis shells, between T. funebralis
funebralis shells, and between T. fune-
and Pagurus in T.
bralis shells and T. funebralis which have had their outer
black layer sanded off. These tests involved placing
