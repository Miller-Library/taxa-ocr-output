larger gastropod shells, producing a strong correlation
between size of Crepidula and size of host shell. At some
point in their life cycle, the Crepidula experience a strong
attraction towards Tegula funebralis shells which does
not involve the actual animal or the shell surface material
or texture but rather possibly an increased sensitivity
and/or attraction towards Tegula shell shape. At this point
the Crepidula attach to adult T. funebralis which prefer
rock faces and crevices. It is in these rocky habitats that
the adult Crepidula are found most abundantly in the inter-
tidal region.
