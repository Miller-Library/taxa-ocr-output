1964) were unable to find Crepidula adunca smaller than
3.8 mm in length in the field. This investigation was
focused towards solving the mystery of the habitat of the
young after dispersal. The results obtained suggest that
young Crepidula adunca attach to small gastropod shells
in sandy, shell-fragmented areas neighboring the rocky
areas where the adults are found on Tegula funebralis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
I. Comparison of young and adults
A Crepidula hatchery was set up by placing Tegula
with male-female Crepidula pairs in aquaria and collecting
the young as they were dispersed. The first phase of this
investigation involved comparison of the behavior and
desiccation tolerance of young and adult Crepidula through
experimentation in the laboratory. The motility of young
was compared to that of adult males and females by measuring
the distances from the point of origin of individual
Crepidula over intervals of five minutes in a large glass
dish. Vulnerability to desiccation was tested by removing
the animals from water, placing them on a glass surface,
and examining them periodically for response to probing.
Death was defined operationally as failure to respond to
probing stimuli after reimmersion in seawater for 30 minutes.
The feeding behavior of the young was compared to
that of the adult by observing radular rasping action or
filter-feeding. To test for radular feeding, a Crepidula
was placed on a diatom-covered slide turned upside-down
into a shallow dish of water and observed under a dissecting
microscope for scraping of diatoms by the radula. In order
