Crepidula adunca in the young and strong attraction of the
adult observed by Putnam (1964) would also fit in well
with the transition from sandy habitats where Crepidula
are found attached to a variety of small shells to rocky
habitats where T. funebralis are found almost exclusively.
The attachment behavior of the young in the artificial
microhabitat also confirms the preference of newborn
Crepidula for small gastropod shells.
The predation experiments suggest that attachment of
Crepidula to Tegula shells may serve as a means of protec-
tion from Pagurus predation.
The preference experiments were designed to explore
the question of what actually attracts the adult Crepidula
adunca to the host T. funebralis shell. The lack of preference
between live Tegula and empty Tegula shells and between
Tegula and Pagurus in Tegula shells both seem to imply
that the main attracting agent is not the live T. funebralis
animal. The lack of preference between scraped and unscraped
T. funebralis shells indicates that the outer material
and texture of the shell does not serve as the main attracÂ¬
tant. The shape of the Tegula shell may be the factor which
triggers the attachment behavior of the Crepidula. Rolfes
and Turken (1979) found that Crepidula adunca exhibited
a definite host species preference for T. brunnea and T.
funebralis over T. montereyi which corresponds to a gradient
in shell roundedness. This finding suggests that Crepidula
may use host shell shape as a criterion for attachment.
If this is the case, an increased sensitivity to host shell
