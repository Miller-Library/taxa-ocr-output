is the absence of small host shells and Crepidula smaller
than 4 mm.
The results of the preference tests performed with
adult Crepidula over an interval of 24 hours indicate
that adult Crepidula showed no preference between T.
funebralis and empty T. funebralis shells (P».05), no
preference between T. funebralis and Pagurus in T. fune-
bralis shells (P).05), and no preference between T. fune¬
alis shells and T. funebralis shells which have had their
outer layers sanded off (P).05).
Predation experiments resulted in a 100% survival rate
of Crepidula. Within about 15 minutes all Crepidula had
attached to either a T. funebralis or Pagurus in T. fune-
bralis shell. Even after 2 weeks of starvation, the Pagurus
made no attempt to remove Crepidula from Tegula shells.

DISCUSSTON
Field studies indicate that young Crepidula adunca
are found in sandy, shell-fragmented areas and among the
sandy holdfasts of algae and Phyllospadix neighboring
the rocks of the adults.They are on small gastropod shells
including juvenile T. funebralis and small gastropod
shells occupied by Pagurus. This habitat seems to fit in
well with the information known about newborn Crepidula.
By attaching to organisms which prefer sandy, lower habitats
almost constantly immersed in water, the young Crepidula
are able to avoid conditions conducive to desiccation
which the adult Crepidula on T. funebralis, often found
(Wara and Wright, 1963), are able to with-
out of water
