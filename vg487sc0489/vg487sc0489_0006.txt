size of shells with Crepidula attached is 6.67 mm with a
standard error of .61. The average size of all potential
host shells is 7.02 mm with a standard error of .27.
18.1% of all potential host shells had Crepidula attached.
In contrast, the distribution of shells in the rock face
habitat shows an abundance of large host shells and a comÂ¬
plete absence of Crepidula of 1 mm (Fig. 4). Average
size of Crepidula found is 8.25 mm with a standard error
of .52. The average size of all potential host shells
is 15.74 mm with a standard error of .17. The average size
of host shells with Crepidula attached is 17.18 mm with a
standard error of .32. 13.2% of all potential host shells
had Crepidula attached. The data indicate that there is
a clustering of small Crepidula and gastropod shells and
a correspondence between size of Crepidula and size of
host shell in the sandy habitat which are lacking in the
rock face habitat.
Fig. 5 shows the relationship between size of Crepidula
and size of host shell found in the sandy habitats. A
least squares linear regression was performed and yielded
the line y-.19 +.28x which appears on the graph. A Pearson
R correlation coefficient of R=.81 was obtained, indicating
a strong correlation between Crepidula and host shell
sizes. Also apparent is an increasing variability in
Crepidula sizes found on host shells with an increase in
host shell size. In contrast, size of Crepidula versus
size of host shell in the rocky habitats (Fig. 6) show
essentially no correlation, a large range of Crepidula
sizes found on all host shell sizes present. Also of note
