INTRODUCTION
The literature on vertical migration of marine
and freshwater zooplankton is voluminous. Compre-
hensive reviews on the topic have been compiled by R.
S. Russel (1927), D.H. Cushing (1951), R. Bainbnidge
(1961), and K. Banse (1964). Light intensity is gener-
ally held to be the main effector of diurnal movement,
but numerous other factors may be influential as modi-
ying agents including among others, the stage of devel-
opment, intrinsic physiological rhythms, and temperature.
With marine organisms, research has been concentrated on
the Copepoda and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cladocera : Exact'>Cladocera,</span> although the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mysidacea : Exact'>Mysidacea,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Isopoda : Exact'>Isop-

investigated to some extent (Bainbridge, 1961). Rela-
tively little seems to be known about the nauplii of the
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cirripedia : Exact'>Cirripedia,</span> however.
Von willemöes-Suhm (1875) recorded that in the
Pacific the nauplii of <span style='background-color:grey' title='Lepas fascicularis : Fuzzy'>Lepas fasicularis</span> (Ellis and Soland-
er) maintained a depth of 60 fathoms (approximately 110 m.)
during the day and rose to the surface during the night.
He made no speculation concerning the stimuli involved in
this migration. Groom and Loeb (1890) reported that the
nauplii of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus perforatus : Exact'>Balanus perforatus</span> (Bruguiere) at Naples reached
a depth of 30 to 10 m. during the day and rose to the sur-

tactic at low light intensities and negatively photo-
tactic at high light intensities. No explanation was
offered as to why the nauplii stayed at the surface once
the sun had set. In a supplement to their original work
on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. perforatus,</span> Groom and Loeb (1890) reported a simi-
lar response to high and low light intensities for nauplii
of the barnacles <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus stellatus : Exact'>Chthamalus stellatus</span> (Poli), <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lepas : Exact'>Lepas</span>

wavelengths of light were found to be the most effective
in elliciting a photo-response.
The influence of temperature upon the sign of photo-
taxis of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus nauplii : Exact'>Balanus nauplii</span> (species not designated) has
also been investigated (Ewald, 1912). Ewald reported that
an increase of temperature caused reversal of positive
phototaxis while conversely, a decrease of temperature
caused negatively phototactic animals to become positively
phototactic.
The present study represents an investigation of the
effect of temperature, gravity, and light as well as their
mutual interactions on the orientation and movements of
the barnacles <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus glandula : Exact'>Balanus

The results indicate a definite correlation between temper-
ature and the sign of phototaxis. Furthermore it was

shown that temperature could restrict the limits of
light induced vertical mig
gration. The apparent negative
geotaxis that occurs in complete darkness was likewise
restricted by temperature.
TERIALS AND METHODS
MA!
Specimens of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. glandula</span> were collected intertidally
at the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California,
while P. polvmerus were obtained from Yankee Point,
California, approximately 11 miles south of Pacific Grove.
In all cases, ripe ovigerous lamellae were dissected out
of the barnacles while still in the field. The lamellae
were stored in seawater during transportation to the
laboratory and during this time no attempt was made to
control temperature. In the laboratory, water temperature
was constantly maintained at 12° C. Lamellae were broken
apart mechanically to facilitate hatching and the nauplii
which hatched were fed on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Platymonas : Exact'>Platymonas</span> sp. Random sampling
indicated that most of the <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Pollicipes : PartialExact'>Pollicipes nauplii</span> tested were
in the 2nd stage of development, while those of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus : Exact'>Balanus</span>
were found to be in both the 2nd and 3rdstages (staging
according to Snodgrass, 1967, Pers. Comm.).
A horizontal testing chamber was used to test the
fect of temperature on the sign of phototaxis. It
measured 1.5 cm. in length by 1.3 cm. in width, while the
275
James S. Umber
water depth was maintained at.7 cm. for each testing.
Two glass partitions could be dropped into the chamber
dividing it into three equal sections. The section
closest to the light source (an AO No. 1087 microscope
lamp) being termed "positive", the middle section "neutral",
and the section away from the light "negative". The
temperature of the testing chamber was kept constant by
means of a circulating water bath. All temperature
readings were taken with a Yellow Springs Tele-Thermometer
equipped with a No. 102 small animal probe. The test beam
of light passed horizontally through the water bath
before entering the positive end of the testing chamber.
Whus, infra-red rays were largely eliminated. The
intensity of the light beam was measured 1 inch from the
end of the positive chamber at the point where the light
entered the water bath. Light intensities were determined
with a General Electric, Type DW-68 Exposure Meter and the
intensity regulated with AO optical density filters.
Reflecting surfaces were blackened wherever possible.
Before each test the nauplii were placed in 100 ml.
beakers and acclimated to dim, diffuse light for at
least one hour. The light intensity at the water surface
of the beakers was maintained at less than 1/2 foot-
candle. Approximately 50 to 100 nauplii were injected
into the testing chamber and exposed to a given water
97
James S. Umber
mperature for a period of five minutes. A horizontal
beam of known intensity was then turned on. The nauplii
were allowed to react to the beam from two to five
minutes until a definite phototactic response had been
demonstrated. The two glass partions were then inserted
into the testing chamber and the number of nauplii in
each section counted.
No field studies are available to document the
possible existence of diurnal migration of 2nd stage
Pollicipes nauplii. However, experiments in vertical
tubes were carried out to observe the interaction and
influence of temperature, gravity, and light on naupliar
behavior. The tubes were 70 cm. long and had an inside
diameter of 1 cm. A glass slide was glued to the bottom
of some tubes, while blackened corks were inserted in
others. The same light source and filiers were used as
before with the addition of a Corning No. 3966 heat
filter. For these experiments, 500 to 1000 nauplii were
injected into each tube after the water had been thoroughly
oxygenated.

degree) in the horizontal chamber using a horizontal
beam with an intensity of 11 foot-candles. 115 individuals
were tested at each temperature and nauplii used at one
temperature were not used again. Results indicating the
percentage of animals swimming to the positive, negative.
or neutral section of the testing chamber are graphed
in fig. 1. The shift from negative to positive photo-
taxis among a majority of the animals occurred between
11° and 9°0.
An identical series of experiments were conducted
with 2nd stage Pollicines nauplii. 360 individuals were
tested at a given temperature as described above. The
results are graphed in fig. 2, A. In this case reversal
of the negatively phototactic response occurred between
9° and 7°c.
The difference in the temperature at which reversal
took place in the two species might be accounted for
by dissimilar sensitivities to a given light intensity.
To test this nypothesis, the same experiment was repeated
ith Pollicibes. In this case, however, the intensity
the horizontal beam was reduced to l foot-candle. The
results are graphed in fig. 2, B and as suspected the
temperature at which reversal occurred was shifted upwards
to about 11°0.

efect of gra
While performing experiments in the horizontal
chamber, it was noticed that the nauplii usually swam
near the bottom of the container. This suggested that
ravitational vector was coupled with their phototactic
a
responses.
To investigate this possibility, nauplii were placed
in the upper 10 cm. of a vertical tube (all subsequent
investigations were carried out in vertical tubes with
2nd stage Pollicipes nauplii) where they remained in
complete darkness for two hours at a constant temperatu
of 12°0. The tube was suddenly illuminated from the side
with 9 foot-candles of light from a vertical fluorescent
lamp. The nauplii responded by swimming toward the light
and aggregating on the illiminated side of the tube. At
the same time however, they swam downward, distributing
themselves evenly to about a 16 cm. depth, where they
seemed to stop their descent abruptly. When the lamp
was moved downward, there was a corresponding downward
shift of the nauplii leaving a few scattered individuals
a the upper 20 cm. of the tube (fig. 3). For some
reason not readily apparent, when the lamp was moved up
again to its original position, the nauplii did not
follow.
To further test the interaction of gravity and the
877

light rosponse, a vertical tube was illuminated from
below with a beam of 300 foot-candles. A heat filter
kept the water tomperature between 12° and 13.5°0
throughout the experiment. The nauplii had been dark
adapted for 2 hours and were swarming in the upper 10 cm.
of the tube when the light was turned on. They rapidly
desconded to the bottom of the tube where they remained
(fig. 1). Some nauplii actively swam downward, but most
simply sank the 70 cm.
The question arose as to how nauplii would behave
in complete darkness. Accordingly nauplii were dispersed
evenly throughout a 70 cm. vertical tube and kept in com-
plete darkness at 12°0. After nine hours 99% of the
nauplii were found to be swarming in the upper 3 cm, of
the tube. Similar results were obtained at a temperature
of 19.5°0. This suggested that an apparent negative
geotaxis was effected in complete darkness.
To determine whether or not temperature could modify
this apparent geotaxis, nauplii were dispersed in the
bottom portion of a vertical tube. This portion was
surrounded by a water bath of 12.0°0. The water surface
at the top of the tube was allowed to warm up to 22°0.
Thus, a sharp warm water thermocline was produced in the
tube just above the surface of the water bath. (It should
be noted that a rapid increase in temperature over a short
27
r
H
James S. Umber
distance will be termed a "warm water thermocline" through-
out this paper. Similarly, a rapid decrease in temperature
over a short distance will be termed a "cold water thermo-
cline"). After 10 hours of complete darkness, the
nauplii were found swarming in a 3 cm. zone in the middle
of the tube (fig. 5). The temperatures delimiting the
zone were 16° and 12°0. A further experiment was run
with the water bath at 8°0. This time the water surface
in the tube was at 20°C. After 11 hours the nauplii
rain were swarming in a 3 cm. zone in the middle of the
tube. This time the zone was delimited by temperatures of

18° and 9°0. It a
the presence of a thermocline could indeed inhibit
movement initiated by apparent negative geotaxis. This
inhibition seemed not to be caused by temperature alone,
but rather by a rapid change in temperature.
To see if nauplii in complete darkness could dis-
criminate between gravity and temperature, animals were
injected into the top of a tube which was 19.590 at the
water surface. A water bath of 12°0 surrounded the
bottom half of the tube. After 10 hours, 25% of the
nauplii were swarming in the top of the tube, 25% were dead
at the bottom of the tube, and 50% were swarming in the
middle of the tube (fig. 6, A). A similar experiment
found 50% of the nauplii swarming in the middle of the
279

tube and 50% dead at the bottom (fig. 6, B).
ipparently, prolonged exposure to the warm upper waters
of the tube were detrimontal to the nauplii. Perhaps
as they sank from the warm zone which had killed many of
them, some nauplii were revived by the cooler waters
causing them to accumulate at the thermocline. It
could not be determined from these results whether or
not nauplii in complete darkness could discriminate
between temperature and gravity.
The effect of light on
ation
tical mig
Nauplii were dark adapted for 2 hours and then dis-
persed equally throughout a 70 cm. vertical tube. An
overhead beam of 1 foot-candle at the water surface
caused all the nauplii to swarm to the water surface
witnin 1/2 hour. Complete darkness was restored for 1
hour and 20 minutes at which time an overhead beam of
3000 foot-candles was turned on. At time zero, the water
mperature throughout the tube was 12°0. A heat filter
was not used, therefore a temperature gradient was soon
created in the tube. The migration of the nauplii
during the 120 minute period of the experiment is
graphed in fig. 7. Water temperatures at various depths
ter 15 minutes and 120 minutes are also shown on the
graph. The temperature gradient created in the tube after
15 minutes does not seem to account for the observed dis-

tribution of nauplii. The initial response seemed
mainly due to the light. However, after 2 hours of
constant exposure to the beam, 90% of the nauplii had
igrated back again into the upper 10 cm. of the tube.
Yet the original 12°0 water temperature had given way
here to a gradient of 21° at the surface to 12.9°0 at the
10 cm. level. Apparently, the nauplii were able to
acclimate to both the increase in temperature and the
3000 foot-candle beam of light. It cannot be determined
rom these observations whether it is the light or
temperature stimulus or both which causes the nauplii to
ascend to the upper 10 cm. of the tube.
Investigations were subsequently conducted to
determine the effect a thermocline might have upon photo-
taxis. Nauplii were accumulated at a warm water thermo-
cline in complete darkness as described above. A beam
of o foot-candles was turned on above the vertical tube.
The results over a 120 minute period are graphed in fig.
8, A. A similar experiment was conducted, but in this
case when the overhead light was turned on, the water
temperature was caused to equilibrate at a temperature of
2°0 throughout the entire tube. Results over a 120 minute
period are graphed in fig. 8, B. The warm water thermo-
cline seemed to delay the positively phototactic ascent
of the nauplii.

To determine the effect a cold water thermocline
nas upon negative phototaxis, nauplii were allowed to
adapt to complete darkness for 10 hours at 12°0 in the
upper 10 cm. of a vertical tube. A 3000 foot-candle beam
of light was then turned on. A cold water bath of 5°0
produced a sharp cold water thermocline at the 30 cm.
pth. After 10 minutes, the water bath was pulled down
10 cm. shifting the thermocline with it. Results over a
30 minute period are graphed in fig. 9 (compare with fig,
7). A water temperature of 7.0° to 7.2°0 was sufficient
to stop migration resulting from negative phototaxis.

tation
ig the progress of these experiments, the
Du
swimming orientation of Pollicipes nauplii was observed.
No matter how the beam of light was oriented, that is
from above, the side, or below, the general orientation
of the nauplii was the same. They were almost always
oriented with their ventral sides up, although all manners
of circus movement were also observed. This posture seemed
to be determined mechanically since dead nauplii sank
with their ventral sides up and their heads slightly
down. Batham (1916) reported similar observations on the
newly hatched nauplii of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pollicipes spinosus : Exact'>Pollicipes spinosus</span> (Quoy and
Gaimard) which also swam with their ventral surfaces
ppermost.

DISCUSSION
Cushing (1951) in a review on diurnal migration
among zooplankton, saw temperature as defining the limits
of vertical movement. The present study would seem to
substantiate this conclusion in so far as the early
stages of B. glandula and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. polymerus nauplii</span> are con-
cerned. B. glandula and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P..polymerus nauplii</span> tended to be
negatively phototactic at higher temperatures and
positively phototactic at lower temperatures. Ewald (1912)
reported similar results. for various stages of B. perforatus.
With Balanus the shift from negative to positive photo-
taxis (using a horizontal beam of 11 foot-candles)
occurred between 11° and 9°0. With <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pollicipes : Exact'>Pollicipes</span> under the
same conditions, the shift occurred between 9° and 7°0
but, with a less intense beam (1 foot-candle) the
shift occurred at 11°0. In the course of this study
the effect of temperature alone never seemed to be ab-
solute. In complete darkness nauplii swarmed via negative
geotaxis in 3 cm. zones delimited by temperatures of both
16° to 12°0, and 18° to 9°0. In both cases these zones
represented a warm water thermocline. Yet a warm water
thermocline seemed only to dely the positive phototaxis
ellicited by an overhead beam of 6 foot-candles. Indeed.
nauplii appeared capable of acclimating to both the
increased temperatures and high light intensity produced

at night. The limits of this migration would most probably
be determined by temperature. It is predicted that a field
study would find Pollicipes and Balanus nauplii at the
rface during the night, descending during the day,
and rising to the surface again at night.
SUMMARY
2nd stage Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby) and 2nd
and 3rd stage Balanus glandula (Darwin) nauplii tend to
be negatively phototactic at higher temperatures and
positively phototactic at lower temperatures.
2. The effect of temperature on naupliar behavior is
never absolute. Nauplii appeared capable of adaption to
both increased temperature and increased light intensity.
3. 2nd stage P. polvmerus nauplii were found to be
negatively geotactic in complete darkness. This upward
gration could be stopped by warm water thermoclines of
both 9° to 18°0 and 12° to 16°0.
1. Negative phototaxis ellicited by a beam of 3000
foot-candles could be stopped by cold waters of 7.0 to 7.2°0.
5. An apparent interaction of negative phototaxis and
positive geotaxis seems to account for the downward
migration of Pollicipes nauplii.
6. The possibility that early stages of Pollicipes
and Balanus nauplii exhibit diurnal migration in the field
is disoussed.
