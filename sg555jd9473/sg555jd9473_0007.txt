Removal of the vitelline layer and jelly layer and homogenate effects on treated eggs
Egg vitelline layers were removed by exposure to strong protease for 5 minutes at a final
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml pronase. Eggs were then washed twice in a large quantity of filtered
seawater. Jelly layers were then removed from these eggs using nitex as described above.
Homogenate effects were tested on both protease-treated and protease-treated jellyless
eggs in a like manner as for jellyless eggs. In this case, eggs were allowed to sit for 10 minutes
after the addition of sperm and then fertilization was quantified by counting the number of eg
with hyaline membranes out of 100 eggs.
Test for the effects of Sigma brand fucoidan
The effect of fucoidan was assessed at logarithmic dilutions of a 1 mg/ml solution of
fucoidan from 0.001% to 100% and also a 10 mg/ml solution was tested at 100%. 500 ul
fucoidan was added to 500 ul egg suspension and then 10 ul sperm was added and fertilization
scored as described.
Homogenate analysis: heat stability
500 ul homogenate was exposed to room temperature (20-24°C), 60’C and 100°C for 10
minutes. 100 ul of each heat treated homogenates were added to 500 ul egg suspension and then
10 ul sperm was added and fertilization scored as above.
Molecular weight estimate of the active factor
Approximately 10 ml crude homogenate was centrifuged at 12,365g for 15 minutes. This
solution was then passed through a 10 um nitex mesh and then filtered through a 0.45 Millipore
