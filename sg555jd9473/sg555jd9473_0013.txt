The inhibitory factor caused sperm to become embedded in the jelly layer, suggesting
that passage through this layer is the cellular target of the inhibitory factor. I then looked to see
if binding occurred after the jelly layer had been removed; sperm-egg binding did not occur, nor
were the eggs fertilized. These data led me to think that perhaps the sperm could not penetrate
the vitelline layer of the egg. When both the jelly layer and the vitelline layer of the eggs were
removed, the inhibitory action was significantly decreased.
These findings lead me to posit that the active component of the fucus homogenate is an
inhibitor of a sperm factor responsible for dispersing the jelly layer and perhaps the vitelline
layer of the eggs. The work of Yamada and Aketa (1983) showed that there are indeed species-
specific sperm dispersal factors. It is possible that the homogenate is blocking the action of one
of these and thereby causing the sperm to become stuck in the jelly layer. This would be a good
starting point for future research.
Analysis of the chemical composition of the homogenate proved to be difficult at more
than a crude level. However, it is also apparent that the active compound (or perhaps
compounds) has a molecular weight greater than 10,000. This rules out simple molecules as the
active compound(s). Furthermore, the heat stability rules out most proteins. Combined, these
observations likely indicate a complex macromolecule(s) as the active component(s), perhaps a
complex polysaccharide or polyphenol, two families of compounds common in fucoid algae.
Fucoidan is a large, sulfated, polysaccharide and was the candidate for this active molecule based
on previous studies (Patankar et al. 1993). This is consistent with studies showing that other
