filter. The filtrate was then separated by centrifuge sieve filtration using a Millipore Centricon
Plus-20 centrifugal filter. Both filtrate and retentate effects on fertilization were tested on
normal eggs by combining 500 ul egg suspension with 500 ul sample and adding 50 ul sperm.
A dilution series was run on the retentate using one-third serial dilutions.
Pentose composition of the active factor
Carbohydrates were determined by the orcinol reaction for pentoses as described in
Colowick and Kaplan (1957) for the following samples: sea water, commercially-available
fucoidan in concentrations of 0% through 100 %, retentate, filtrate and raw homogenate. The
sugars were quantified by absorption at 670 nm in a Hitachi U-2000 double-beam
spectrophotometer and scanned over 400-700 nm wavelength range. Samples were scanned
against distilled water and seawater.
Microhabitat tests
One gram of fucus was placed in 100 ml of filtered sea water and allowed to sit outside in
the sun for 10, 30, 60, 180 or 360 minutes. Also 100 ml of plain filtered seawater was allowed to
sit for the same amount of time. The fucus was removed and the seawater was then allowed to
cool to near room temperature (21-24Â°C). 2 ml egg suspension was then added to 10 ml sea
water and allowed to sit for several minutes, 100ul sperm was added and fertilization scored as
above.
