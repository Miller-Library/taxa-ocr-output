Because the sperm were embedded in the jelly layer, I looked to see if removing the jelly
layer would allow fertilization to occur in the presence of the homogenate. One hundred percent
of the jellyless eggs fertilize in the control situation. However, in the presence of the
homogenate there was 0% fertilization. I then looked to see if the sperm were becoming stuck to
the secondary layer around the egg, the vitelline layer. The sperm did not bind to the secondary
layer. This being the case, I looked to see if the eggs would fertilize without a vitelline layer.
However, 100% of the protease treated eggs fertilize in the control situation but 0% in the
presence of the homogenate. I anticipated that the sperm should have been able to fertilize the
eggs in the absence of both layers but I then discovered that protease treated eggs still had some
jelly layer. When this layer was removed by passing through nitex mesh the control eggs
showed 52% fertilization and the same eggs in the presence of homogenate showed 37%
fertilization.
Properties of the Fucus homogenate
The inhibitory factor was found to be active after exposure to 100â€™C for 10 minutes, with
100% fertilization in the control and 0% in the presence of homogenate. After the fraction was
run through the centrifuge sieve filter both the filtrate and the retentate were tested for activity
and the retentate was found to be the active fraction again reducing fertilization to 0% compared
to a 100% control.
1 next assayed for the presence of pentose sugars in the retentate using the orcinol
reaction. This test represents a way to see if there are fucoidan like compounds in the retentate
