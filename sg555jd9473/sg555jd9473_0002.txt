INTRODUCTION
In the 1950’s a small literature showed that homogenates of the fucoid algae Fucus
vesiculosus inhibited the fertilization of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
(Harding 1951, Runnström et al. 1959). Further work suggested that fucoidan in the algae might
be the inhibitory factor. However, this work neither indicated the mode of action of the
inhibitory factor nor did it speculate on whether this effect could be documented in situ. The
purpose of this project was to reexamine these older findings in light of our current knowledge of
fertilization. I also hoped to be able to determine if fucoidan was indeed the inhibitory factor in
the homogenates. Finally, I wanted to see if the effect seen in the laboratory might occur in
some form in nature.
There have been many significant scientific insights into the mechanisms of fertilization
since the 1950’s. The inhibitory factor(s) in the homogenate may have had one (or more) of
several cellular targets not yet discovered in the 1950’s. Two candidate targets that my data
seem to support are sperm-egg binding and sperm factors that degrade the outer egg coats. The
sperm has been shown to bind tightly to the egg surface during fertilization (Vacquier and Payne
1973). My data shows that the sperm do not bind to egg surface while exposed to the fucus
homogenate, but rather become embedded in the jelly layer. We also know that there are
species-specific sperm factors that are used to disperse the jelly coat of eggs prior to fertilization
