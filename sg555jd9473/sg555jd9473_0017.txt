1. The concentration curve showing the relative inhibitory action of the fucus homogenate over
à range of concentrations.
2. A normal egg, fixed in formaldehyde, with sperm bound to the egg surface.
3. A normal egg exposed to fucus homogenate, fixed in formaldehyde, with sperm embedded in
the jelly layer as shown by the arrows.
4. The absorption of commercially-available fucoidan treated with the orcinol reaction. The
solid line is a third degree polynomial curve fit and the dashed line is the absorption of the
retentate and its equivalent concentration.
5. A spectral scan of 0.3 mg/ml commercially-available fucoidan against seawater.
﻿6. A spectral scan of the retentate against seawater.
7. Normal eggs fertilized in the presence of commercially-available fucoidan. All eggs
fertilized. Some were normal as seen on the left and some raised secondary membranes as
seen on the egg on the right.
8. Eventually, all eggs fertilized in the presence of fucoidan at a concentration of 1 mg/ml or
higher lysed.
