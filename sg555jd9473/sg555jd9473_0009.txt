Fucus homogenate strongly inhibits fertilization in S. purpuratus eggs
The effects of the fucus homogenate was tested in concentrations from 0.01% to 100%
crude homogenate on normal gametes and had no appreciable morphological effect as observable
by light microscopy up to 200x. However, the homogenate did have marked effects on egg
fertilization (all effects compared to a control of 500 ul egg suspension, 500 ul filtered seawater
and 10 ul sperm). When raw homogenate is added to eggs there is 0% fertilization whereas
control fertilization was 100%. Fifty percent inhibition was achieved at a homogenate
concentration of 0.5% (figure 1). The homogenate and sperm mixture added to eggs decreased
fertilization by 20% indicating that there may be a time factor involved. This effect was seen to
be partially reversible since eggs combined with fucus and then washed showed 30% fertilization
when 10 ul of sperm was added where as the control was 100%.
Homogenate causes sperm to become stuck in the jelly layer
Sperm binding assessed by examination of eggs fixed in formaldehyde showed that in the
control situation eggs had Â» 100 sperm bound at the egg surface (figure 2). However, when the
binding assessment was carried out in the presence of the homogenate sperm were visibly stuck
in the jelly layer and did not bind to the egg surface (figure 3).
Removal of the jelly layer or vitelline layer alone does not increase fertilization and removal of
both increases fertilization
