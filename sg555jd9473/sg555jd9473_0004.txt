METHODS
Homogenate preparation and concentration approximation
Fucus gardneri (heretofore referred to as fucus) was collected from the rocky intertidal at
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Two pieces were cut to the same wet
weight (1-2 g). One of the samples was then homogenized in a 20ml glass homogenizer with a
teflon pestle in eight to ten ml seawater. Homogenization was stopped after approximately 50
strokes when there was no appreciable change in the appearance of the homogenate. The extract
was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 13,000 rpm in a microfuge and the supernatant used for
subsequent experiments. 500 ul aliquots of supernatant were frozen at -20’c and thawed
immediately prior to use.
Gamete Collection
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus gametes were collected by injection of O.5M KCl.
Females were placed upside down on a 50 ml beaker of filtered sea water into which gametes
were shed. Sperm were collected “dry" by pipette from males set upside down. Sperm was
suspended at 1% in sea water and stored on ice each day for experimental work.
Testing homogenate effects on gametes and fertilization
The effects of the fucus homogenate were tested on many combinations of sperm and
egg. Those combinations and volumes are represented below:
-5.
