DISCUSSION
My results confirm and considerably extend the earlier observations on the inhibitory
effects of algal homogenates on urchin fertilization. The fucus homogenate contains a potent
inhibitor of purple urchin fertilization, which eliminates the spermâ€™s ability to pass through the
jelly layer. The inhibitory factor is a heat stable macromolecule(s) with a molecular weight
greater than 10,000, but does not appear to be fucoidan as was previously suggested. Finally,
while there is reason to suspect that there might be in situ effects of the inhibitory factor, my data
showed no such effects.
The fucus homogenate contains a potent inhibitor of purple urchin fertilization. The
interaction with the eggs is time dependent. If the factor is allowed to interact with the eggs for
several minutes before the addition of sperm, fertilization is completely blocked; however, if
sperm and homogenate are added directly to the eggs, without giving the homogenate time to
interact with the eggs prior to addition of the sperm, there will be 80% fertilization. Finally, if
the homogenate is washed off of the eggs there is 30% fertilization, which indicates that the
activity of the homogenate on eggs is at least partially reversible. The factor is effective at very
low levels, producing 50% inhibition even at a 1:500 dilution, which is equivalent to 4 ug/ml of
fucoidan.
