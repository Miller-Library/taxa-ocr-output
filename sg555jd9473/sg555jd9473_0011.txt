and filtrate and acts as an approximation for the amount of fucoidan in the extracts. Figure four
is a standard curve of commercial fucoidan dilutions. Using a third degree polynomial curve fit
on the normal curve, the absorption of the retentate indicates that the retentate is a 0.22 mg/ml
equi valent of fucoidan.
The homogenate is not fucoidan alone
Comparison of the absorption curves of fucoidan and the retentate show similar but not
identical curves suggesting that the sugar composition differs from fucoidan. As seen, the
absorption in the 600-700 nm range is very similar however; the peaks are not the same in the
400-500 nm range.
Comparison of the effects of fucoidan and the homogenate on fertilization also indicate
that the inhibitory action on fertilization is not due to fucoidan as seen in figures seven and eight.
Fucoidan does not inhibit fertilization of eggs in concentrations up to 10 mg/ml (figure 7).
Additionally, fucoidan causes what appears to be a secondary fertilization membrane to rise
(figure 7) and then causes cells to lyse (figure 8). None of these effects were seen with the
homogenate.
Can intact fucus exude the inhibitory activity?
The microhabitat experiments were set up to determine if the inhibitory factor in whole
fucus plants was leaked into seawater. The water in the microhabitat experiments had no
appreciable effect on the level of fertilization of eggs. In each case there was a -15% decrease in
fertilization between the control situation and the fucus treated water.
