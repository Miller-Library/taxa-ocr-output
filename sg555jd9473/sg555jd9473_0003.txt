(Yamada and Aketa 1983). This knowledge combined with the fact that sperm cannot penetrate
the egg jelly indicates that the inhibitory factor may act on these sperm dispersal factors.
The action of sperm dispersal factors is inhibited by sulfated polysaccharides such as
heparin and glucose-6-sulfate (Yamada and Aketa 1983), making fucoidan a likely candidate for
the inhibitory factor. However, comparison of the action of fucoidan and the fucus homogenate
on normal urchin gametes as well as spectrophotometric analysis indicates that the inhibitory
factor in the homogenate is not fucoidan alone.
Fucoid algae living in the field may have similar effects as the homogenate does in the
laboratory. Fucus and purple urchins have some overlap in their vertical ranges (Russell 1987).
This results in a number of possible interactions that could cause the fucus to have a mechanism
for inhibiting urchin fertilization. Urchins may feed on fucus and, as a result, the algae produce a
factor that is capable of reducing urchin numbers. It is also possible that the algae and the
urchins compete for space and the algae tries to get more space by keeping urchin populations
low. However, preliminary trials show that the inhibitory factor is not simply leaked into
seawater by the algae.
Our current knowledge provides many new insights into how this inhibitory factor might
work. This project was designed to look for a cellular target of the inhibitory factor, to explore
the role of fucoidan as the inhibitory factor and to see if these inhibitory effects were evident in
nature.
