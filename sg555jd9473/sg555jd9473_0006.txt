Sperm binding experiments
This technique was modified from Vacquier and Payne (1973). 100 ul egg suspension
were combined with 100 ul sperm and then 200 ul 5.6% formaldehyde was added 15 seconds
later. To examine homogenate effects 100 ul homogenate was added to 100 ul egg suspension
and allowed to sit for several minutes, 100 ul sperm was then added and then 300 ul 5.6%
formaldehyde 15 seconds later. 50 ul of each sample was viewed at 200x by light microscopy.
Removal of the jelly layer and homogenate effects on jellyless eggs
Jelly layers were visualized by mixing an equal quantity of 6% sumi ink dissolved in
seawater with the egg suspension and then by looking for a "halo" by light microscopy at 100x.
Egg jelly layers were removed in one of two ways. The first was to pour the egg
suspension several times through a 90 um nitex mesh. The second was to take suspended eggs
and add O.IM HCl until the suspension reached pH 5. The eggs were then added to a large
quantity of filtered seawater and pH corrected to 8 with 0.1M NaOH (if not already at this pH).
To test the effects of homogenate on jellyless eggs, 500 ul egg suspension were
combined with 100 ul homogenate or 100 ul filtered sea water and let sit for several minutes.
Then 50 ul sperm was added. Binding experiments were also performed on jellyless eggs by the
method described above.
