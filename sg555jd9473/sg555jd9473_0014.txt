sulfated polysaccharides (heparin) or sugar sulfates (glucose-6-sulfate) block the action of sperm
dispersal factors (Yamada and Aketa 1983). However, the spectrophotometric analysis for
fucoidan in the homogenate, combined with the bioassay, indicate that fucoidan alone is not
responsible for the inhibition of fertilization. As was presented in the absorption data (Figures 4
and 5), the peaks at 600-700 nm show similarities between the two samples, but the increased
absorption in the retentate at 400-500 nm is indicative of other unidentified carbohydrates in the
extract, many of which may have some action on fertilization. However, the orcinol reaction
only detects pentoses and therefore is at best an estimate of relative fucoidan concentration in the
homogenate. In the future, more extensive analyses that could give quantitative assessments of
the various types of sugars in the homogenate would allow better understanding of its action.
An impetus for exploring the possible effects of the inhibitory factor in nature was to
examine the potential species interactions of the fucus and the urchins. However, the data in the
microhabitat experiments indicate that the inhibitory factor is not leaked into the seawater from
whole plants. These preliminary experiments only looked at the natural release from plants in
water incubated in sunlight. The algae is likely subject to tidal grinding, de- and rehydration and
warming in its life history and any one of these mechanisms could cause an inhibitory effect in
situ. Further studies should be done to test these mechanisms and their implications.
In conclusion, the inhibitory action of a factor(s) contained in fucus homogenates as
shown in work from the 1950â€™s has been confirmed. It is a complex macromolecule(s) that is
heat stable and has a molecular weight greater than 10,000 but is not fucoidan acting alone as
-15.
