ABSTRACT
Crude homogenates of the algae Fucus vesiculosus contain a factor(s) capable of
inhibiting the fertilization of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin) eggs. Previous
studies indicated that this effect might have been due to the polysaccharide fucoidan. I here
examined the effect of the homogenate at a molecular, cellular and ecological level. Inhibitory
activity was present in seawater homogenates of the algae at a concentration of approximately 2
mg fresh weight/ml. The inhibitory factor was heat stable and molecular sieve centrifuge
filtration showed the active fraction had a molecular weight above 10,000. Comparison of the
Â»10,000 MW fraction with fucoidan indicates that the inhibitor in the homogenate is not
fucoidan or is not fuciodan alone. Sperm binding experiments showed that the factor(s) prevents
sperm from penetrating the jelly layer of the eggs and possibly from penetrating the vitelline
layer. This suggests that the factor(s) inhibit a sperm enzyme that allows sperm to penetrate the
jelly layer and perhaps the vitelline layer. Studies assessing whether intact F. vesiculosus might
leak the inhibitory factor into the surrounding seawater-as in a tide pool- and thereby affect
fertilization were inconclusive. Characterization of this potent inhibitor could provide new
insights into the sperm-egg interactions leading to fertilization.
