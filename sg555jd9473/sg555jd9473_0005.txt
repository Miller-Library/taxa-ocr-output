Volumes
Plain sperm
100 ul 1% sperm
100 ul homogenate
800 ul filtered seawater
Plain eggs
500 ul egg suspension
100 ul homogenate
400 ul filtered sea water
Homogenate added to egg suspension and ther
500 ul egg suspension
sperm added
100 ul homogenate
10-100 ul 1% sperm
300-400 ul filtered seawater
Homogenate added sperm then eg
100 ul 1% sperm
suspension added
100 ul homogenate
800 ul filtered seawater
These were combined and then 500 ul of this
solution was mixed with 500 ul egg suspension
Homogenate added to egg suspension then the
500 ul egg suspension
eggs were washed and sperm added
100 ul homogenate

—Wash
Re-suspend in 500 ul filtered sea water and
then add 10-100 ul sperm.
Homogenate was used in concentrations ranging from 100% to 0.01%. Fertilization was
quantified by counting the number of eggs with a raised fertilization membrane out of 100 eggs.
