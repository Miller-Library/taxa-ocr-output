Changes in the Ability to Fertilize with Time
A series of 10-fold dilutions was made of dry sperm into sea water.
Each suspension was assessed for its ability to fertilize immediately after
dilution, and again after 2 hours. Since a 018 suspension went from close to
100% fertilization to 03 fertilization during this time period, it was chosen as
Ã  convenient concentration for observing the decline in a suspensions
fertilizing-capacity with time lnote: this procedure is not trivial since the
fitness of sperm vary from urchin to urchin. Therefore a concentration
deemed suitable on one day may be undesirably potent the nextl. The
change in the suspension's ability to fertilize was determined by taking a
samples at successive times after dilution and performing the "percent
fertilization" procedure (described above).
Effect of Added Protein
Stock concentrations of superoxide dismutase and BSA solutions were
prepared by adding img of the respective proteins to 10 mis of filtered sea
water (FSW). Two five-fold dilutions were made for each solution, yielding
solutions with 02, and 004mgs of protein per mi of FSW. To each of these
media, as well as to a FSW control, was added enough dry sperm to
constitute a O1 suspension. The resulting sperm suspensions were
assessed for changes in ability to fertilize with time.
