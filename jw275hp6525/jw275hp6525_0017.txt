18199: The effect of aging on the ability of sperm (a 0057 suspension) to respond to
egg jelly and to Ca+ ionophore A23187. 1ml of sperm was added to each of the
folloving: 500ul egg jelly. 500ul Filtered Sea Vater (ESV-as a control), Sul A23187 in
DMSO (final concentration of 50uM), or 5ul DMSO (as a control). Acrosomal reaction
percentages vere obtained from scoring 60 or more sperm using a transmission
electron microscope.

3: The effectiveness of various egg concentrations (ratio of jelly volume to a
fixed 200ul of sperm) on inducing the acrosomal reaction. Scoring vas performed
visually using a transmission electron microscope. Aged sperm refers to a 0057
suspension that vas given sufficient time (120 min.) for fertilizing capacity to reach
0%. The sperm vere then concentrated by centrifugation for more efficient scoring
The fresh sperm'refers to a suspension that vas subject to the same reconcentrating
procedure immediately after disution.
