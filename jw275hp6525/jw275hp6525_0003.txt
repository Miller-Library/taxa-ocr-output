Methods
Collection of Strongylocentrotus Purpuratus gametes was
accomplished by injecting 1-2mis of SM KCl into the coelomic cavity of adult
urchins. After injection, the urchins were shaken, and monitored for
subsequent spawning. If the substance emitted from their gonopores was
white (sperm), it was collected dry and stored at 42 C. Eggs (distinguishable
from sperm by their orange color) were collected in a beaker of filtered sea
water. They were later passed though a 10OuM millipore filter to remove
unwanted debris, and mechanically stirred in a 142 C water bath.
Determination of egg concentration was performed by centrifuging a sample
of the suspension in a Bauer Schenk tube for one minute. Concentration is
expressed in terms of percent (vol-vol) packed eggs in sea water. All
experiments were performed using gametes obtained the same day.
Percent Fertilization
The fertilizing capacity of sperm was determined by adding imi of the
sperm concentration indicated to 2mls of 18 egg suspension. The sperm
were given 3 min to find and fertilize an egg At the end of 3 minutes, the
interaction among gametes was halted by the addition of 2ml of 5M KCI (an
effective spermicide). A sample of the gamete suspension was then analyzed
using dark-field microscopy. Fertilized eggs were easily identifiable by the
presence of their fertilization membranes. Percent fertilization refers to the
number of eggs bearing this membrane out of the total number observed
(100 or more).
