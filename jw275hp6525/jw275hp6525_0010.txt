observation lby 9, 13, & 151. Tyler asserts that the prolonging effect of
amino acids and proteins is due to their ability to bind hms present in the
dilution medium. Their action is thus akin to that of chelators. The fact that
exogenously added protein can bind h.ms (primarily due to the presence of
sulfhydryl groups on amino acids such as cysteine 13 & 91) suggests that the
site of hm.-toxicity is on sperm proteins. Cell membrane-imbedded proteins
would be particularsy vulnerable due to their intimate contact with sea
water. This model, then, suggests that a prime suspect for the loss of
sensitivity to egg- jelly would be damage to the jelly receptor itself. Upon
dilution (and the entailing increase in exposure to hm.s), this receptor would
quickly accumulate damage and soon lose the ability to bind or respond to
its ligand. This would explain the inability of aged sperm to acrosomally
react in the presence of egg jelly
Energy Depletion Model
The energy depletion model argues that this inability resusts from a
lower ATP level rather than physical damage. It is known that the internal
pH of sperm rises upon dilution I10l, and in their 1985 paper, Christen,
Schackmann, and Shapiro (the seminal figures" in advocating this theory)
cite a correlation between the internal pH and the endogenous ATP levels.
They propose that as pH(i) increases, so does internal ATPase activity (there
is a fall in ATP levels). Respiration is shown to increase to meet these
energy demands 121, but only up to a point. As the pH(i) rises above 7.4, the
oxygen consumption (and hence ATP production) remains constant 13l. This
creates an energy imbalance, and with time, the ATP levels drop. This model
could be interpreted to show that the drop in ATP prevents the egg jelly
stimulus from inducing the acrosomal reaction. Although this assumes that
the translating process requires energy, such an assumption is not
