Figure 1 shows that upon dilution of the sperm to 018, there was a
loss in the ability to fertilize with time. One min after the dilution was
made, the sperm yielded 938 fertilization. Seventy-five minutes later, the
same suspension was incapable of fertilizing eggs (08 fert.). This confirms
the results of Pennington I1 11 and Hayashi 181. Higher concentration
suspensions retained their ability to fertilize longer. 12 suspensions kept at
14° Cwere observed to vield »958 fertilization even after 2 days (data not
shown).
In accordance with previous studies (13l, 1141, and 1161), the addition
of protein into the dilution medium preserved the fertilizing capacity of the
spermatozoa. Figure 2 illustrates that the sperm maintained higher
fertilization percentages with the addition of 02 mg/mi of superoxide
dismutase or bovine serum albumin (as compared to the FSW control).
Dropping the concentration of protein to 004 mg /mi diminishes the sperm's
fertilizing longevity to that of the control. Although the original design of
this experiment was to see if superoxide dismutase could prolong the
lifetime of sperm above the BSA control, the negative result is confirmation
that proteins in general preserve sperm.
Attempts to associate the decline in the sperm suspension s ability to
fertilize with a rise in the number of spontaneous acrosomal reactions were
unsuccessful (contrary to studies on Lytichinus Bictus by 191). Figure 3
shows that as fertilization percentages declined, the percentage of sperm
which had undergone the acrosomal reaction remained essentially zero
A good percentage (592) of fresh sperm were observed to react when
treated with egg jelly (Table 4). However, sperm that had been allowed to
age (180 min.) until they were incapable of fertilizing eggs (08 fert.) did not
