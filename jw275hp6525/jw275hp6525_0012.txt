gametes than myself, I regard my failure to reproduce their results as a
reflection of my own competency rather than a discredit to theirs. Still,
confirmation of their resu√Æts must be achieved. Until that time, we cannot
rule out the possibility of h.m. damage to the receptor as an explanation for
the acquired insensitivity to egg jelly
Other Possibilities
Although there is good evidence for the correspondence of heightened
activity and subsequent inability to fertilize, this does not necessarily mean
that the ATP levels are directly responsible. Perhaps some indirect
conformational change occurs as a result of declining ATP levels. For
instance, this change may trigger a programmed cels death sequence.
Another possibility is that deleterious byproducts of respiration (e g. reactive
oxygen species such as the superoxide anion) may accumulate with time,
damaging the signal transduction mechanism of the egg jelly receptor. R.I
Aitkin has shown evidence for the accumulation of ROS with time in human
spermatozoa 11).
It is my hope that the question of sperm senescence will continue to
be addressed until its mechanism is confirmed. Such confirmation should
provide insight on how to better preserve sperm. If the mechanism proves
similar to that seen in human spermatozoa, future research may suggest
ways of improving artificial insemination procedures. Furthermore, certain
types of impotency (those stemming from senescence) may prove treatable
Although these practical applications strongly merit further investigation of
the matter, the most compelling argument in favor of future research is
simply this: the subject is intriguing
