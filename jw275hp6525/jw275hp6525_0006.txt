procedure did not diminish the sperm's potency (958 fertilization before
and after centrifuging). Vaquier's re-concentrating technique made it
possible to get Ã  more dense distribution of sperm on each colloidion-coated
grid, thus economizing the time spent using the TEM.
The scoring procedure was the same as describe under "percent
acrosomal reactions" heading, however, egg jelly or Ca-ionophore A23187
was added before fixing. Initially, set amounts of these acrosomal reaction-
inducing agents were added. Either 500ul jelly or 5ul of lOmM ionophore
(in DMSO) was added to Iml of sperm. Five minutes were given for
triggering of the reaction before fixing. Additions of 500ul FSW and 5ul
DMSO served as controls.
To determine the concentration dependence of these agents in
initiating the acrosomal reaction, 0058 suspensions of fresh" and aged
(180 min.) sperm were prepared and re-concentrated when the fresh sperm
had lost potency. Two hundred microliter aliquots of sperm were added to
800ul, 400ul, 200ul, and 10Oul of egg jelly. To study the effect of the
ionophore, additions of 1, 2.5, 5, and 1Oul of 1OmM ionophore (in DMSO)
were made to iml of sperm (yielding final concentrations of 10, 25, 50, and
100uM A23137). Fixing and scoring procedures were identical to those
described above.
The egg jelly was obtained by dropping the pH of a concentrated egg
suspension to pH 5 by the addition of IM HCl. After 1 min., NaOH was added
to bring the pH back to pH 8 (that of sea water). The suspension was then
hand-centrifuged and the supernatent (jelly-containing) fraction frozen for
future use. The A23187 Ca+ ionophore was obtained from Sigma Chemical
Company
