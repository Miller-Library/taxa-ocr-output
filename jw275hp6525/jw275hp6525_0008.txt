extend their acrosomal process in the presence of jelly (08 acrosomal rxn.)
No response was observed from sperm treated with FSW instead of jelly (in
agreement with the " 03 spontaneous acrosomal reactions noted earlier).
In contrast to egg jelly, the Ca+ionophore A23187 was able to initiate
a high percentage of acrosomal reactions in both fresh and aged sperm. The
percentage was actually higher (903) in the case of aged sperm than fresh
sperm (772). Experiments varying the concentration of the ionophore
suggest that the difference in response of fresh and aged sperm to A23187 is
not significant. The DMSO control was ineffective in initiating a reaction (02
acrosomal rxn.).
Varying the concentration of egg jelly did not greatly affect the
percentage of reacted sperm observed (see Table 5). There was no
observable difference between a 2:1 (jelly to sperm) and a 1:2 suspension.
The data suggest the relationship is asymptotic (limit at 458 in this case),
but further experiments using lower jelly concentrations would have to be
performed to confirm this. Aged sperm showed a slight increase percent
acrosomal reactions when the concentration of jelly was increased, but
always remained far below the percentages achieved by their freshly-
diluted counterparts.
Figure 5 shows the striking similarity of fresh and aged sperm in
response to ionophore. As the percent of acrosomal reactions observed in
fresh sperm grew from 238 to 638 (with increasing ionophore
concentrations), the values for the aged sperm emulated this rise
(progressing from 308 to 588)
