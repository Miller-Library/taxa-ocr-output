Abstract: Spermatozoa from the sea urchin, Strongykentrotus
Purpuratus are shown to lose the ability to fertilize soon after
dilution. Acrosomal reaction studies, using both nascent and
senescent sperm, demonstrate that sperm are becoming
insencitive to egg jelly (the natural inducer of the acrosomal
reaction 141) with time. Although unable to respond to the jelly
stimulus, aged sperm suspensions yield a high percentage of
acrosomal reactions when treated with Ca+ionophore A23187.
Hence, impaired potency arises from the inability to receive
the egg jelly ligand and initiate a Ca+ influx. Possible causes of
this acquired inability are discussed.
Introduction
Sea urchins' lives begin with the haphazard meeting of eggs and
sperm spawned into the vast ocean. The time window in which this meeting
can successfully occur is not without boundaries. Laboratory experiments
show that the sperm lose their ability to fertilize shortly after dilution into
sea water 16, 7, 8, 11, & results herein). Interestingly, sperm collected 'dry
(in concentrate form) and kept at ocean temperature (142 C) retain their
ability to fertilize for several days.
Upon dilution, sperm encounter a sea water environment (as opposed
to seminal fluid). This suggests that there is some toxic agent in sea water
leg. heavy metals) may decay the sperm 17, 9, & 141,; or that senescence
results from the loss of some component in the seminal fluid 18). Another
effect of dilution is to lead the spermatozoa from a state of quiescence to one
of great activity. In 1928, J. Gray noted that a diluted sperm suspension
respired more actively than a concentrated one, and indeed had a higher
respiratory level than an actively beating vertebrate heart (in terms of
volume oxygen consumed per gram of tissue). His explanation for the low
respiratory level of concentrated sperm was that each spermatozoon exerted
some form of inhibition on the movement of its neighbors I7l. Subsequent
