Percent Acrosomal Reactions
Imi samples of the sperm suspension were fixed by adding 1OOul of
378 formaldehyde solution. These mixtures were then spun in an Eppendorf
microfuge for 1 min. to concentrate the sperm. Sul was then transfered from
the bottom of each tube to colloidion-coated grids. 10 minutes were given
for the sperm to settle and adhere. The grids were then rinsed in water and
set to dry on filter paper. Observation and scoring of the acrosomal reactions
were performed with a transmission electron microscope (see 14, 5, & 9l and
figure 6).
Percentage Spontaneous Acrosomal Reactions
A 0058 suspension was made and assessed for changes in fertilizing
capability with time (described above). At the same time points the
suspension was analyzed for percent acrosomal reactions (also described
above).
Egg lelly and Ca+ lonophore Induced Acrosomal Reactions
A 0058 sperm suspension was allowed to reach a fertilizing capacity
of 08 (130 min.). It was then concentrated 100-fold using a technique
described by Vaquier (15 min at 1500g in a swinging-bucked
centrifuge) l151. A 'freshâ€œ 0052 suspension was made by resuspension and
subjected to the same re-concentration process immediately after dilution.
Rechecking the fertilization percentage confirmed that centrifugation
