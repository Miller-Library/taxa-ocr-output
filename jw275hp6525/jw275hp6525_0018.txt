119 G: The effectiveness of various Ca-ionophore concentrations on inducing the
acrosomal reaction. Scoring vas performed visually using a transmission electron
microscope. Aged sperm refers to a 005% suspension that vas given sufficient time
(120 min.) for fertilizing capacity to reach 02. The sperm were then concentrated by
centrifugation for more efficient scoring. The 'fresh sperm'refers to a suspension
that vas subject to the same reconcentrating procedure immediately after dilution
