Discussion
Attempts at inducing the acrosomal reaction in fresh and aged
populations of dilute sperm have suggested a new reason for the decline in
fertilizing potential in X purpuratus. The sperm of this sea urchin are not
spontaneously reacting, nor are they losing the ability to undergo a reaction
entirely; they are simply becoming unresponsive to the egg jelly stimulus
over time. It is known that extension of the acrosomal process is triggered
by a rise in both the internal pH and the Ca-level 15,10, & 121. Since 'aged'
sperm (ie sperm which have lost the ability to fertilize an egg) are
insensitive to egg jelly, but do undergo an acrosomal reaction when treated
with the Ca+ ionophore, the acquired inadequacy must be somewhere
between the binding of egg jelly and the subsequent influx of Ca- Below I
consider the two prevailing views of sperm senescence, and how these could
relate to the loss of ability of sperm to respond to egg jelly
The Toxic Heavy Metal Model
Spermatozoa are exposed to the constituents of sea water upon
dilution. If certain constituents were harmful to the sperm, this might
explain why the ability to fertilize is lost soon after dilution. The sperm
would accumulate damage with time. Studies have shown that such
damaging entities exist in the form of heavy metals (h.m.s) 19, 13, & 141. In
1953, Albert Tyler demonstrated that the addition of hm. chelating agents to
sea water greatly improved the longevity of spermatozoa vis-a-vis their
fertilizabilty. He also noted that artificial sea water of lowhm content
extended fertilizable life and motility. By decreasing the amount of exposure
to these toxic ions, sperm potency can be prolonged.
Results in this paper show that the addition of non-specific protein can
enhance the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa. This confirms previous
