unwarranted. It is reasonable to believe that some step in the signal-
transduction system is ATP-consuming (eg the phosphorylation of Ca-
channel proteins may be necessary for their opening).
How does this model account for the fact that removal of hmns
prolongs fertilization potential? It has been shown that the addition of
chelators lowers the pH(i) l3 & 9l. This implies that their preservational
action is not directly through the sequestration of odious toxins, but rather
indirectly through the maintenance of high ATP levels. From this standpoint,
we can equate the effect of hm. chelators to that of a pH buffer. Indeed, it
nas been shown that lowering the pH of sea water enhances sperm viability
131. This does not disprove the heavy metal model since the affinity ofhms
for sulfhydryl groups is known to decrease with decreasing pH: Granted the
sperm activity is decreased, but so is h.m. binding.
One experiment performed by Christen et al. potentially disproving
the heavy metal hypothesis involves the addition of potassium ions (in the
form of KCl) to the sea water medium. Their results indicate that Sea Water
containing 50 mM in K- preserves sperm longevity far longer that their SW
control (1OmM K*). The proposed action of this added ion involves
decreasing the membrane potential set up by high intracellular, and low
extracellular IK-l. This inhibits a H- efflux, and, hence, maintains a low pH(i)
(effectively curbing energy usage). The added K-should not effect the
binding of membrane proteins by hms. Therefore, the ability of K-
additions to prolong sperm potency seemingly invalidates the heavy metal
model. My own attempts at preserving fertilizing potential with K-- both by
direct addition of KC to filtered sea water, and by emulation of the ASW
conditions of Christen et al. -were entirely unsuccessful. Since the mempers
of the Shapiro lab are far more experienced in working with sea urchin
