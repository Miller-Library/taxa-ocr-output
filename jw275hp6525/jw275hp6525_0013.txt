Acknowedgements
Foremost, I would like to thank Dr. David Epel-a veritable cornucopia
of insights, suggestions, and knowledge - for spending countless hours
guiding a stray lamb this quarter. I would also like to thank Chris Patton
and Rob Swezey for acquainting me with all of the technical equipment I
needed to conduct my goose-chases.
