studies revealed that the inhibiting factor in semen was carbon dioxide. This
product of respiration creates a low pH environment in which the sperm are
essentially immotile 110l. Diluting the sperm raises the internal pH, resulting
in heightened activity. It has been proposed that the ensuing fall in ATP
levels, or a byproduct of this process, may be the source of sperm senescence
11, 3, & 71.
The experiments described in this paper are aimed at unveiling the
physical changes which render sperm incapable of fertilizing an egg. It is
my hope that the results may help identify the instigator of these changes
