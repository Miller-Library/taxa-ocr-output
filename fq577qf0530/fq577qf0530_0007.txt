Feeding in Ophelia assimilis
Anne Billingsley 8
extracting lipids, as no trace of lipid material can be detected in the
feces. Protein appears to be the major nutrient in the diet.
O. assimilis appears to be somewhat selective in feeding. Ground
glass lacking either a naturally developed film of organic material or
one of the test substrate resulted in a much lengthened transit time
primarily because it was not readily eaten. The animals stopped taking
in this nutrient-free material after brief periods of ingestion. Not
only do these animals appear to be selective with respect to nutrient
content but they are selective with respect to particle size as well.
Finally, the process of defecation appears to be closely tied to the
process of eating. Defecation was observed to occur only during feeding.
Further work is planned on the nutrition of these animals in relation
to their metabolism and energy budget.
SUMIARY
1) Ophel:
a assimilis is a sand-feeder deriving a large part of its
nutritional requirements from organic material adsorbed to sand
ains, and seemin
gly little else.
2) The worms select for particle size of sand grains when feeding, and
appear to distinguish and select sand grains containing adsorbed
organic material.
