xtremely small in amount. No lipid was detected in the fecal material.
DISCUSSION
Microscopic examinations of feeding substrate, gut contents, and
fecal material of Ophelia assimilis indicate that this worm derives most
of its nutrition from organic material adsorbed to ingested sand grains.
Sand grains taken from the guts of freshly collected animals are free
from organic detritus, plankton, or small animal and plant material.
Similarly, defecated sand lacks organic detritus and contains surviving
flagellates and undamaged diatoms which have passed unaltered through the
gut.
Results of organic carbon determinations of sand from the worm's
natural habitat indicate that the sand has relatively low levels of
organic carbon, 270 ug/ml. The worms, however, extract 60-67% of this
organic material. This amount appears to be sufficient to meet their
nutritional needs.
The food substrate consists mostly of adsorbed protein, which is
present in quantities six times greater than the combined polysaccharide
carbohydrate and lipid. The worms are able to extract and utilize 74%5
of this available protein, taking up about 152ug per ml of the sand
that they ingest. The worms assimilate only 40% of the carbohydrate. Lipid
levels are very low. However, the worms may be extremely efficient at
