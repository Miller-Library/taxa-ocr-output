Feeding in Ophelia assimilis
Anne Billingsley 6
The normal feeding behavior of worms placed on labelled sand from
the habitat was as follows. After an interval ranging from one half hour
to five hours the worms began to feed. Feeding was readily detected as
the worms everted their proboscides and ingestion could be observed.
Defecation started at the same time and continued as long as the worms
continued to feed. Transit times were measured as the interval between
the start of defecation and the first appearance of color-labelled
substratum in the feces. No defecation occurred if animal were placed
in containers lacking an ingestible substrate.
Animals placed on uncoated ground glass fed for only short intervals
with accompanying short intervals of defecation. Therefore, the transit
time as measured was considerably longer. Transit times of worms placed
on ground glass coated with protein, starch, or lipid approached that of
the worms on the natural substratum. However, feeding was somewhat less
continuous. Table 1 presents the measure and transit times on different
substrates.

ciency. Table 2 presents the results of chemical
analyses of the sand from the habitat and the feces obtained from the
worm. It is observed that the worms take up about 162 ug carbon per
ml wet sand, or approximately 67% of total organic matter available.
The protein uptake of the sand by the worms was determined to be approximately
152 ug protein/ml sand, indicating a 74% utilization of the protein avail-
able. Fecal samples exhibited a 40% uptake of the polysaccharide car-
bohydrate present in the sand. The lipid content of the sand was
