Feeding in Ophelia assimilis
Anne Billingsley 3
The studies reported here were conducted to determine whether or
not O. assimilis is a sand-eater, deriving all of its nutritional
requirements from the organic carbon adsorbed to the sand grains. It
further sought to determine the qualitative and quantitative nature of
the food of this animal, the percentage uptake of total organic carbon
as well as specific nutrients, and examined the efficiency of nutrient
utilization. Determination of selectivity of food substrate was also
investigated, along with transit times of sands coated with natural and
test materials.

MATERIALS AND MEIHODS
Specimens of O. assimilis were collected from a sandy beach adjacent
to the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Animals were
maintained in running sea water in sand for no more than four days before
use in experiments. Sand samples from the worms' habitat were collected
a few hours prior to analysis, and were sifted through a.495 mm Standard
kler screen to a size found to correspond to the particle size ingested
by the worm. Samples of sand were washed with distilled water prior to
analysis. Feces were collected from fresh worms which were hand-washed
to remove adhering sand particles and placed in Petri dishes on an inert
substrate of ground colored glass approximating particle feeding size.
Dishes were filled with Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Inc., Eastlake,
Ohio), to avoid organic carbon deposition from sea water, and the dishes
