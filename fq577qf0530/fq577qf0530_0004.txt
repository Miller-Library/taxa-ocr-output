Feeding in Ophelia assimilis
of a .495 mm Standard Tyler screen. Only 3% of the sand in their habitat
is of this size. It appears that the worms were selective in terms of
particle size ingested. Little else than sand could be seen on micro¬
scopic examination of the feces or gut contents.
Feeding experiments. Transit times for sand from the habitat and
substitute food substrates were investigated as follows. Sand from the
habitat was sifted to obtain the size fractions acceptable to the worms.
Artificial sands were prepared by grinding colored glass to the same
particle size. For some experiments the ground glass was coated as
follows. The glass was placed in running sea water so that a natural
film of material could be aquired or specific substrates were adsorbed.
Bovine Serum Albumin, soluble starch, and vegetable oil (Wesson) were
added to ground glass samples at a concentration of 100 ug/ml of ground
glass. The oil was dissolved in petroleum ether; the protein and car-
bohydrate were dissolved in distilled water. All glass particles with
artificial substrates were dried to constant weight either by heating
to 100°C or at room temperature. Analyses of these artificial sands
revealed that 90 of the protein, 40% of the starch, and 100% of the
lipid remained adsorbed after washing with Instant Ocean. Freshly
collected worms were placed on a test substratum in a Petri dish con¬
taining sea water or Instant Ocean maintained at 15°0. Sea water was
used only with sieved sand from the habitat. Habitat sand was mixed
with ground glass coated with a natural film to permit identification
of this natural test substrate.
