Feeding in Ophelia assimilis

were placed on a sea table overnight with sea water running to maintain
a temperature of 14.5Â°0. The feces were pipetted from the substrate and
washed thoroughly with distilled water. Fecal material from 82 worms was
used for analyses.
Organic carbon content of sand and feces was determined using the
wet ashing procedure described by Strickland and Parsons (1968) and
expressed as micrograms carbon/ml wet material.
Protein was determined using the method by Lowry et al. (1951) and
a standard of Bovine Serum Albumin, Armour Fraction V.
Polysaccharide carbohydrate was determined on a sodium hydroxide
digest of the sand following the method of Somogyi (1934), and subsequently
analyzed by the colorimetric method of Dubois et al.(1956). The method
was originally designed for the estimation of glycogen in tissues and
the application of the method to analysis of sand provided an estimation
of the larger insoluble carbohydrate fraction.
Lipids were determined by weight after extraction with petroleum
ether.
RESULTS
Dissections of freshly collected worms revealed guts filled with sand
for nearly the entire length of the worm. All of the sand taken from
the guts of worms was of a similar size and could pass through the mesh
