Feeding in Ophelia assimilis
Anne Billingsley 2
INTRODUCTION
Ophelia assimilis (Tebble) is reported by Hartman (1969) to occur
in the sandy beaches of Central California. The worms live as isolated
groups in mid-intertidal regions which are exposed during medium and low
tides but covered during high tides. The sand they inhabit is clean and
relatively free of conspicuous organic detritus, lending interest to the
source of their food supply. Studies done on a closely related species,
Thoracophelia mucronata (Treadwell) by McConnaughey and Fox (1949)
suggest that these worms feed on organic material adsorbed to sand grains,
possibly as colloidal micelles, and other fine particles adhering to the
sand or closely associated with it. Wilson (1948a), when studying larval
settlement in Ophelia bicornis (vide de St.-Joseph) observed that relatively
little organic material adsorbed to the sand grains is sufficient to
support the nutritional requirements of this species and that the "cleanÂ¬
est" sand will nourish these worms adequately. However, substrate
analysis and feeding behavior have not been examined in detail, save
a single study on carotenoid uptake in T. mucronata (Fox et al., 1948).
Observations of the anatomy of O. assimilis show this worm has
a simplified pharynx unequipped to capture prey, lacks filter-feeding
or plankton-concentrating structures, and has reduced parapodia and
setae. This simplified anatomy and the animal's restriction to organically
impoverished substrates suggests that their feeding habits and food supply
are similar to those of T. mucronata and O. bicornis
