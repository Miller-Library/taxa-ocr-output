four 0.25 m' quadrats were selected on each transect line, in
areas not previously disturbed by sampling. At each, a sheet
metal quadrat frame was inserted into the beach and all animals.
both those on the surface and those bur
rrowed to a depth of 3
inches, were counted. Animals were returned to the quadrat of
capture immediately after counting. Locations of quadrats
along the transect lines were changed with each sample time.
Night observations were made with the use of a flashlight
covered with red cellophane, since preliminary observations
had shown the animals respond much less to this than to white
light. Animals which were mating, and animals close enough
to an occasional Polinices to be exhibiting escape response
(Edwards, 1969) were not counted in the study,

The results are su

During the ebb tides, there was a significantly greater
number of Olivella pointing downslope than upslope at Stations
A and B, while at Station C, still covered by more than one
foot of water, a larger number of animals were still oriented
upslope. At lower low water (LLW) almost all Olivella at each
station pointed downslope. The final counts, taken during
tidal flow about three hours later, showed a reversal in
orientation at the low station (C), while at the upper stations
the majority of the animals still pointed downslope.
