MATERIALS AND METHODS
All studies were carried out on the shore just east of
Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey harbor, California, an area
characterized by a very gentle slope and little wave action,
ransect lines parallel to the water's edge
I set up three
within the intertidal region occupied by Olivella biplicata.
The transects, separated by 15-foot horizontal intervals
on the beach, were labelled Station A (at the tidal height
of +1.1 ft), Station B (+0.25 ft) and Station C (-O.25 ft).
On separate occasions, both day and night, observations were
made at three selected times before, during and after the
period of lower low water (LLW).
At each sample time, Olivella at each transect area were
examined to see whether they were oriented facing upslope or
downslope. Animals headed in any direction upward of a line
roughly parallel to the wave front were counted as facing
ipslope; conversely for downslope. When any station was
submerged by more than 6-8 inches of water, animals found on
the sand surface provided the most reliable data on true
orientation. When the transect area was exposed at each LLW.
leaving a firmer substrate, nearly all the animals burrowed
below the surface, but the orientation of the burrowed Olivella
could be reliably determined.
Along with studies of orientation upslope and downslope,
at each observation time quantitative measures were made of
Olivella population present at each
ransect level, to provide
