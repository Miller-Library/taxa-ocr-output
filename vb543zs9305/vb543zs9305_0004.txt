Actual numbers of animals per unit area at the transects
(Figure 1), as based on the sample population counts, showed
a decrease in the total number of Olivella at Stations A and
B, complemented by an increase in the total number at C, as
the tide receded. During the rising tide, there was a reversal
of this distribution, and the numbers at A and B increased
again while those at C declined. The changes observed in
distribution are those which one would expect if orientation
upslope and downslope is a reflection of movement in these
directions. The variability between the four 0.25 m samples
taken at any one time on a particular transect was fairly great.
for Olivella are rather gre
jarious (Edwards, 1965) and show a
clustered, non-random dis
ribution. While the differences be-
tween populations at given transects at different times are
not statistically significant, the results obtained are strongly
suggestive of population movement up and down the beach. Data
in Figure 1 were obtained at night and early in the day. The
results shown in Figure 2 indicate that statistically significant
changes in orientation with phase of low tide also occurred
during daylight hours. Downslope orientation corresponded to
the receding tide, and, as before, there was a reversal of
direction with the incoming tide, and most observed animals
headed upslope.
