The gastropod Olivella biplicata (Sowerby, 1825) is common
in many localities on the Pacific Coast of North America from
British Columbia to Baja California, and has been the subject
of several investigations. A large population occurs in and
around the harbor at Monterey, California (Smith & Gordon, 1948).
Wr. David W. Phillips of Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove,
California (personal communication) had noted that individuals,
at least those in and near the intertidal zone, undergo more
or less regular shifts in orientation and position on the beach
with changes in tide level, and suggested a quantitative inves-
tigation of this behavior. Shifts in position and activity
with tide have been noted in other sand-dwelling gastropods,
eg. Oliveancillaria brasiliensis (Chemnitz, 1788) (see Gofferje,
ricula) auricaularia (Lamarck, 1810)
1950) and Olivan
cillaria (Lint:
(see Marcus & Ma
reus, 1959). The orientation and movement of
Olivella biplicata have been examined in one study (Edwards,
1965), but primarily from the point of view of differences
between size classes in natural populations. The purpose of
the present study was to confirm, and provide a measure of,
the tendency of Olivella biplicata to move downward on receding
tides and upwards on incoming tides.
