SUMMARY
The intertidal sandy beach gastropod Olivella biplicata
exhibits downslope (seaward) directional orientation as the
tide ebbs toward lower low water and upslope orientation as
the tide rises. Some seaward and landward movement of beach
populations also occurs. These orientation changes occur
whether low tides come during the day or the night.
