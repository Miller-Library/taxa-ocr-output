DISCUSSION
There is a clear indication of a change in orientation
of Olivella biplicata in the hours before and after lower low
water. Although only the differences in numbers oriented upslope
vs. downslope are significant, the variations in population at
each level on the beach are entirely consistent with these
data, suggesting that considerable numbers of animals move up
and down the beach with the tide. This is further corroborated
by qualitative field observations. Movement is not highly
directional; most moving Olivella follow rather tortuous paths.
However, they are capable of travelling up to several meters
per hour (Stohler, 1969). The stimuli involved in eliciting
this behavior have not been determined, though the possibilities
are numerous. There has been some speculation as to what the
advantages are to Olivella in maintaining intertidal populations.
Edwards (1965) has suggested that intra-specific competition
and protection from subtidal predators, eg. Polinices and
Pisaster, might force larger animals to move higher up on the
beach. In addition, a third possible factor could be the
high rate of turnover of detritus in this region of the beach,
providing a continuously rich food supply for Olivella. By
moving with the tide, the intertidal Olivella population can
minimize periods of exposure and spend a correspondingly greater
time in such activities as feeding and mating,
