To examine the fauna above tidepools, samples were taken at 1, 5.
and 9 centimeter levels above the pool. Four samples were taken at each
level above pools which had a long interface with homogeneous algal
cover on the slope above the pool. A short piece of 32 millimeter
diameter brass pipe was used to core a sample down to the substrate, and
then everything was scraped off the substrate as completely as possible
and included in the sample. The sample was then covered with isopropyl
alcohol and analyzed in the lab. Snails and hermit crabs were separated
and scored without further categorization. Mesobiota were sub-sampled
in a finger bowl by taking six 20X fields of view on a dissecting scope.
The counts for each field of view were then summed and used for compari¬
son with other samples. The types of mesobiota scored were copepods,
isopods, amphipods, acarina, and clams. Only those algal fronds which
were intact from the holdfast were measured for length.
RESULTS
The results of the algal composition sampling program are pre¬
sented in Figure 1. There were a total of 20 tidepool sites and 21
non-pool sites sampled. The data demonstrates a significant difference
in algal composition between areas adjacent to a tidepool and areas at
least 50 centimeters removed. The Student's t-test for comparison of
the means of two populations was made for the seven species of algae,
and for each the difference of means for the two areas was significant
(pe.05). Gigartina papillata was much less abundant around tidepools,
as were Endocladia muricata and Rhodoglossum affine. The last two
species were found around tidepools very rarely. Gelidium coulteri
and the crust Hildenbrandia were more abundant in areas adjacent to tide
pools than in non-pool area, and Lithothamnium californicum and Corallina
were generally found only around tidepools.
