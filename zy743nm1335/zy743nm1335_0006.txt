sharp gradient of small hermit crabs (shell length less than 6 millimeters),
largely Pagurus hirsutiusculus but also juvenile Pagurus samuelis. None
were found at the non-pool sites. Conditions above the pool in the algal
turf must be suitable for them, and predation by the cottids may legislate
against their occupancy of the tidepool. Their exploitation of the niche
may be responsible for the observed reduction in small gastropods.
Another observation on tidepools is that though there were many
barnacles all about the pools, there were none found in the pools them¬
selves or in a zone of 1-2 centimeters above the pool's water level. While
it has been reported that the gastropod Acanthina punctulata is an im-
portant predator on barnacles (Sleder, 1979), this does not adequately
account for the sharp demarcation observed, since the snails freely range
in and out of the pools. Predation by other tidepool species may account
for the absence of barnacles in pools. However, Conover and Sieburth (1966)
reported that tannins secreted by the brown alga Ralfsia verrucosa are
toxic to Balanus cyprids, and Magre (1974) indicates that a species of
Ulva has deleterious effects on barnacles in tidepools. Another possible
explanation is that the barnacles simply require the periodic exposure
which tidepool inhabitants are protected from.
There are many factors operating in the mid-intertidal zone, and
it is difficult to disentangle them all and determine what is causing
what. The effects of tidepools seem to be related mostly to its in¬
habitants. The inhabitants of tidepools vary with size, among other
things. For example, the bigger the pool, the less extreme are the physical
conditions of it, and the more abundant is its associated algae. These
pools also support larger fish and crab predators. In the second pool
sampled for fauna above it, no hermit crabs were found. Much larger
fish were seen in the pool, however, and perhaps there is a correlation.
