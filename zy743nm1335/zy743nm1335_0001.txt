INTRODUCTION
Tidepools are one of the more interesting habitats of the rocky
mid-intertidal zone, existing as almost isolated communities when
exposed by the tide. Most studies have focused on tidepool organisms
such as cottid fishes (Nakamura, 1971, 1976) and the active hermit crabs
(Fotheringham, 1976; Gerlach, 1976). However, there appears to have been
few studies done on tidepools as complete entities (Canning, 1971).
In my study, I did not look so much at the tidepool itself and its
inhabitants, but rather I focused on the area immediately surrounding
a tidepool and tried to determine the general effects of a tidepool on
its adjacent community.
The questions I was trying to answer were: In what way does a
tidepool affect the area around it? What species are found around
tidepools that would not or could not be there were it not for the
presence of that pool? Is the algal composition around tidepools difÂ¬
ferent from the mid-intertidal zone in general? Is there more or less
algae around pools? I was looking for effects both in the fauna and in
the algae. Although I anticipated that the pressures exerted by a tide-
pool might be subtle, I considered that over time an enduring tidepool
would effect an equilibrium condition where the pool's effects would
be discernible.
