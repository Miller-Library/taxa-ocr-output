Prohaska, J .R.
As there were no hermit crabs in the area adjacent to the pool, there
was a clear gradient of small gastropods.
Finally, from both the algae sampling program and the fauna sampling
program, it seems that the effects of tidepools do not exceed about 10
centimeters from the pools. It is in this region that further studies
should be focused.
SUMMARY
I- The composition of algal species in areas adjacent to tidepools is
significantly different from the algal composition of areas at least
50 centimeters away from a tidepool.
2- Rhodoglossum affine is particularly rare around tidepools, and this
is consistent with the reports of the grazing preference of Tegula
funebralis for this alga.
3- Mesofauna is generally more abundant around tidepools and decreases
over a 10 centimeter distance above the water's edge.
4- It appears that the effects of tidepools do not generally exceed a
range of 10 centimeters.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to thank the faculty Hopkins Marine Station and all the
students of the Spring class for making the last ten weeks so enriching.
My special thanks to Bill Magruder and to Chuck Baxter, my advisor and
an ole tidepool watcher from way back.
