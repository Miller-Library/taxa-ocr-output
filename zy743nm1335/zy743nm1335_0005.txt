DISCUSSION
My first observations encouraged me that there were indeed effects
by tidepools upon the adjacent areas. Observations on pools while the
tide changed indicated that Tegula funebralis and especially hermit
crabs closely followed the rising and receding tides. Exposure to
high density feeding pressure would be expected to show effects, and
the results of the sampling programs definitely support this conjecture,
The first sampling program clearly demonstrates that the composiÂ¬
tion of algal species around tidepools is much different from what one
would expect in that area of the mid-intertidal zone. Especially
noteworthy is the almost total absence of Rhodoglossum affine around
tidepools, for it has been reported that Tegula funebralis, one of the
most prominent inhabitants of the tidepools I looked at, has a marked
grazing preference for this alga (Best, 1964). High grazing pressure
would allow few sporelings to escape.
Generally, it is clear that there is much less turf algae around
tidepools. This is perhaps contrary to what one might expect, since
a tidepool's physical effects (increased light, greater humidity) seem
advantageous to algae. But the summed grazing effects of all the tide-
pool inhabitants, including the cottids and Pachygrapsus crassipes, may
be the overriding factor here. Of course, there are more crustose
forms around the pools, but these are perhaps more favored by the
pool's physical effects while being less subject to the effects of
grazing. The same can probably be said for Corallina.
The study on a tidepool's effect upon the adjacent faunal community
is far from exhaustive, yet some general effects have been discerned.
There is more abundant fauna around tidepools, and the fauna tend to be
organized in sharp gradients. Figure 3 shows that there was a very
