Separating the algae into two types, crustose forms and turf
algae, also showed interesting results. As can be seen in Figure 2.
there is strikingly less turf algae in the areas surrounding tidepools.
Again, the difference proves to be statistically significant (p..05).
The data also indicates that there is much more of the crustose algae
such as Lithothamnium californicum, Hildenbrandia, and Petrocelis
around the pools.
I also wanted to examine the effects of a tidepool on the fauna
of the adjacent community, and Figure 3 shows the results of the fauna
sampling program. It shows a substantial gradient of small hermit
crabs above the pool while no hermit crabs were found in the control
area less than one meter away sampled at the same heights. Though no
gradient appears among the snails, the data does indicate that there
were fewer snails around the pool than in the control area. There was
a sharp gradient in the mesobiota in the area adjacent to the pool, and
the mesobiota were much more abundant there than at the control site.
There was also a slight gradient in the frond lengths of the algae
(G. papillata), but this gradient was also present at the control site.
Figure 4 presents the fauna sampling data for an area with rela-
tively homogeneous algal cover adjacent to another pool. There was no con¬
trol forthis data, but it is useful because the associated tidepool was
very different from the first one. The pool itself was much larger, and
the face sampled had a different orientation, slope, and substrate.
There was less sediment and many calcareous tube worms. Still, gradients
of snails and mesobiota are clearly demonstrated, and even more inter¬
esting is the total lack of hermit crabs at the site.
