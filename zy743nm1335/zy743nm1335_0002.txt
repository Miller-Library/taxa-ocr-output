MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study involved two sampling programs. The first was designed
to compare the algal composition of areas adjacent to a pool and areas
more removed from a tidepool's influence. The second was designed to
contrast the fauna found in the turf algae immediately surrounding a
pool with that of the non-adjacent turf.
The study area was a portion of the protected rocky intertidal
zone at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. The area
ranged in tidal height from approximately 1.0-3.0 feet above mean lower
low water and was characterized by the algae Gigartina papillata,
Endocladia muricata, and Rhodoglossum affine. The tidepools found at
the study aite generally had volumes of less than five liters.
The sampling program for comparing the algal compositions in¬
volved running two 20-meter transects across the mid-intertidal zone
parallel to the shoreline. The transect line was fitted closely to the
terrain, and random points were selected along the transect. If the
point was at least 50 centimeters distant from a tidepool, it was con¬
sidered a non-pool site, and a 10 X 10 centimeter quadrat was positioned
with the transect point in the center. Algal cover was then estimated
to the nearest five percent for each species present. Tidepool sites
were selected by taking the pool nearest a given random point along the
transect, roughly determining the center of the pool, and then taking a
random direction and placing the quadrat on the face encountered in that
direction so that the bottom of the quadrat was at the water level of
the tidepool. Again the algal cover was estimated to the nearest five
percent for each species present.
