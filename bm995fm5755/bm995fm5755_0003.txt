caused some bias in comparing fractal dimension to animal
abundance.
In this study I follow the lead of Gee and Warwick (1994) but
measure the fractal dimension of each individual alga sampled so
that the relationship between fractal dimension and animal
abundance can studied more closely. Studying the variation of
fractal dimension within one species also allows me to control for
the grazing quality the alga provides to its resident snails. By
controlling for grazing quality, wave exposure, and tidal height,
I hoped to determine how significant the fractal dimension of algae
is for the animals living on it.
Materials and Methods:
The intertidal red alga Mastocarpus papillatus was studied
because it exhibits a wide range of morphologies in the field and
occurs commonly along the Pacific Coast of North America (Bell,
1992). The snails Littorina scutulata and Tricolia pulloides were
used as indicators of animal abundance because they were the most
abundant animals on M. papillatus in my study site at Hopkins
Marine Station and because of the ease of counting and manipulating
them. The only other abundant macroscopic animals living on the M.
papillatus at Hopkins Marine Station were amphipods, and their high
mobility made them difficult to quantify and handle. It was
assumed that amphipod abundances did not affect snail abundances.
Forty-nine Mastocarpus papillatus were collected randomly from
an exposed site at Hopkins Marine Station, 39 from a tidal height
