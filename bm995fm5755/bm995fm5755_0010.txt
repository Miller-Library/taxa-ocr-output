provides a glimpse of what might be shaping animal communities in
the intertidal zone. More samples need to be analyzed and more
relationships established between animal abundances and substrate
complexity as measured by fractal dimension before the true
descriptive power of fractals can be known.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I thank Mark Denny for being my advisor. It was wonderful to
learn from him and his unique way of looking at the world. Thanks
also to the members of the Denny lab for being friendly and
interested. I am indebted to Chris Patten for enabling me to
photograph numerous samples of algae. I would also like to give
thanks to Jim Watanabe whose expertise on the intertidal zone is
invaluable and finally, to our T.A. Ellen Freund.
