dimensions differed between plants that did and did not have snails
living on them. A third comparison was made between the fractal
dimensions of the algae collected at the higher site and those
collected at the lower site.
Population manipulation experiments were conducted to
establish whether the number of snails living naturally on a given
algal thallus would return to its prior level after perturbation.
The number of snails living on each of twelve algae was counted and
the algae marked by hole-punching adjacent algae. The population
of snails was doubled on 4 thalli, eliminated on 4 thalli, and left
the same on the remaining 4 thalli. The populations of snails on
each alga were then monitored over the next 3 days.
Results:
The fractal dimension of inhabited algae collected at the low
tidal height ranged from 1.34 to 1.60. The higher the fractal
dimension of a particular alga, the more snails that are likely to
inhabit that alga (Figs. 1 and 2). When including all samples
collected, the R"2 for the regression is 0.169 (fig. 1), indicating
that 16.98 of the variation in snail population density can be
accounted for by fractal dimension. The slope of this regression
is significantly different from zero (pÂ«0.05, student's t-test).
When samples of weights less than 1.75 grams are eliminated, the
2 for the regression is 0.550 (fig. 2), indicating that 558 of
snail densities can be accounted for by fractal dimension. The
slope of this regression is significantly different from zero
