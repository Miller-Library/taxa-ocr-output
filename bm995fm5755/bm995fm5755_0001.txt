Abstract:
Fractals describe the increase in the length of a line with a
decrease in the scale at which it is measured. A greater fractal
dimension at a particular scale may translate into more habitat
space for an animal of that size, and therefore greater expected
abundances of that animal. I tested for the presence of such a
relationship between the alga Mastocarpus papillatus and the small
snails, Littorina scutulata and Tricolia pulloides, living on it.
The use of M. papillatus provided a range of morphologies so that
the effects of fractal dimension could be examined within a species
of alga. This intra-species comparison allowed for a control of
the grazing quality of the alga. Indeed higher fractal dimension
was shown to correlate with a higher density of snails.
To determine if a fixed number of snails is associated with
each thallus, experiments were performed in which the natural
populations of snails on M. papillatus thalli were altered. The
number of snails on each thallus was found to return to the
original number of snails the day after treatment. This result
indicates that there is a relationship between snail density and an
individual alga.
