can help explain those observed snail densities.
Why use fractals to describe habitat complexity? Surface area
per weight has been used to describe complexity (Hicks, 1977, 1980,
Russo 1990). However, surface area is difficult to measure for
complex forms such as algae and it cannot specify complexity for a
specific scale. The fractal dimension of any substrate can be
determined at the scale of interest, and therefore the complexity
of habitat that a particular sized animal experiences can be
quantified. This allows examination of the distribution of animals
of differing body sizes within a habitat.
Why is habitat complexity such a strong determinant of
population densities? It could be simply that a more complex
substrate will provide more space for inhabitants, as well as more
food, shelter, and water. An increasing fractal dimension can
increase more than just space, however. It can contribute to more
suitable microclimate conditions such as lower temperatures and
higher humidity (Johnson, 1973). Johnson found that not only does
algal complexity affect microclimate, but that amphipod abundances
respond to microclimate conditions.
Fractal dimension is clearly not the only factor that is
important in determining animal abundance. I showed that the
fractal dimensions of inhabited and uninhabited algae are not
significantly different at similar tidal heights and wave
exposures. Other factors must be causing some algae to be more
attractive to animals than others such as an alga's position on the
rock, which influences its exposure to sunlight, and the density of
