computer program which analyzed the image according to the grid
method used by Mandelbrot (1982), Sugihara and May (1990), Morse et
al (1985), and Shorrocks et al (1991). A square grid divided into
4 smaller squares is fit around the image of the trace. The number
of squares the image enters is counted. Then each small square is
divided into four and the number of squares containing part of the
outline are again counted. This process is repeated n times such
that the final number of squares will equal 2'n. The natural
logarithm of the number of squares entered at each level n is
plotted against the natural logarithm of the length of a side of
the smallest individual square. The negative slope of this log-log
plot is the fractal dimension of the image.
A centimeter scale was photographed with each alga so that the
tracing could be scaled to life size. An n of 4 or 5 was used for
analyzing M. papillatus, depending on the size of the tracing.
This number of levels gave a smallest square size between 2 and 2.5
mm, which most closely approximates the body size of the snails
being counted, and is therefore an estimate of the scale at which
this species experiences and uses its habitat.
The natural logarithm of the fractal dimension of each alga
collected at the lower tidal height was plotted against the natural
log of the density of snails between 1 and 3 mm in size. A plot
was made with and without samples weighing less than 1.75 grams.
Algae that were uninhabited by snails were left out of the analysis
to exclude algae that were potentially undesirable places to live.
A separate test was conducted to determine whether the fractal
