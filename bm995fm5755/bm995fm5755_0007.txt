(p«0.001, student's t-test).
The mean fractal dimension of populated algae was 1.46 while
the mean fractal dimension of unpopulated algae was 1.43, and the
difference in fractal dimension was not significant.
The
difference between algae at the low tidal height (mean D-1.39) and
at the high tidal height (mean D-1.47) was significant only at the
0.1 level.
In the experiments where snail populations on algae were
manipulated, the control thalli remained at their original numbers
over the 3 days (fig. 3). The thalli from which all snails were
removed all returned to their original populations the first day
after the manipulation and oscillated around 1008 on the second and
third days (fig. 4). The thalli on which the population of snails
was doubled dropped back down to their original numbers on the
first day but then continued to drop on the second and third days
(fig. 5).
Discussion:
Gee and Warwick found a correlation between the density of
macrofauna and meiofauna living on four species of intertidal algae
and the fractal dimension of those algae. My research also found
a relationship between fractal dimension of intertidal algae and
animal abundance; fractal dimension is able to account for up to
558 of the variation in abundance of snails on M. papillatus. In
addition, I demonstrated that there is an approximately steady¬
state number of snails that occurs on each alga. Fractal dimension
