then moved off and buried itself. In the other case, evidence of
rasping was found on the underside of the fish, indicating that a
buried snail had fed on it from below, or a snail had extended its
proboscis underneath the fish. In the first trial, three of the four
snails came out of the substrate within 2 hours after introduction of
the fish. The snails in the second tank did not react as quickly,
though, and it was at least 21 hours before any snail came out of the
substrate. In Trial 3, snails 9 and 11 (Fig. 3c) passed within 5 cm of
the fish, but did not come in contact or stop to feed.
Two T. brunnea, 2 T. pulligo, 3 T. montereyi, and 2 Calliostoma
ligatum were consumed during both lab feeding trials. During
capture, the Kelletia encountered the Tegula from different directions
each time. Kelletia then forced its foot under the shell rim of the
prey and gradually wrapped its foot around the underside of the
Tegula. During feeding itself, the Kelletia rested on the back or side
of its shell on the bottom of the tank. Complete consumption of prey
lasted at least 6 hours. In two of the three instances of predation on
T. montereyi, the head and foot were not consumed. During the
second feeding trial using a new group of Kelletia (n=6), one T.
montereyi was consumed completely.
When offered other invertebrates, Kelletia only consumed the
live sipunculid worm after it had crawled out of the test tube. In no
case was a Kelletia observed inserting its proboscis into the test
tubes to reach the invertebrate inside.
In the field, Kelletia were found feeding on Tegula brunnea on
three separate occasions. In one instance, a Kelletia was found in a
Diopatra mat with its proboscis extended at least 3 times the snailâ€™s
