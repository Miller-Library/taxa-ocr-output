Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
observation period. Again, four new snails with distinct markings
were used and were placed in the center of the tank within 2 cm of
each other.
Field Activity Patterns
Fifteen Kelletia were collected from the field on May 6, 1994.
and were tagged with epoxy attached to their shells (Rosenthal,
1969). Numbers were etched into the epoxy to distinguish
individuals. Bright yellow nylon strings approximately 10 cm long
were attached in the epoxy tags to aid in relocation. These tagged
snails were then taken to Location 1 (Fig. 1) and released at
approximately 5:00 pm. The snails were then observed 18.5 hours
later in the same vicinity. Headings and distances moved from the
original drop point were measured with a compass and a tape
measure to the nearest cm.
A second group of twenty snails were collected and tagged
according to the procedure outlined above, with an additional mark
on the epoxy to distinguish the snails from the original tagged group.
The snails were kept overnight and released at Location 1 (Fig. 1) the
next morning. The snails were observed 1.5 and 4 hours later, and
then again 73 hours after release. As in the first tagged group,
headings and distances moved from the original drop point were
measured in a similar fashion.
Gut content analysis was performed on five snails: three
collected from the sand, and two collected from rocks, to determine a
relationship between activity patterns and foraging behavior. The
snails ranged from 85 mm to 95 mm in length.
