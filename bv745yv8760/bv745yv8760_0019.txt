Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Figure Legends
Fig. 1: Map of the Kelp Forest and the Hopkins Marine Station
of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California. Location
indicates the drop site for tagged snails, and Location 2 indicates the
mating aggregation discovered on May 17.
Fig. 2: Frequency histogram of snail size of K. kelletii found
outside of the aggregation; on rock and on sand.
Fig. 3: Graphs showing the burial intervals for three trials of
observations of K. kelletii in the laboratory. 3a shows Trial 1 lasting
65 hours, 3b shows Trial 2 lasting 216 hours, and 3c shows Trial 3
lasting 74 hours. Note the scales are different between 3a & 3c and
3b. White rectangular boxes indicate burial periods with length in
hours written in; plain horizontal bars indicate activity periods. The
shaded vertical bars indicate periods of no observations.
Fig. 4: Snail size versus percent time the snail spent buried,
with the fitted regression line and regession equation displayed.
Correlation is insignificant with a p value 50.05
