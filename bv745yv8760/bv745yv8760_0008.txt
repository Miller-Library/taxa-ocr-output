Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
once or twice during the trial (Snail 10, Fig. 3c). Others buried
themselves up to 5 times with intervening active periods of varying
lengths (Snail 7, Fig. 3b). No diurnal pattern of activity was
observed. On one occasion snail 9 followed the path of snail 11 over
a distance of 195 cm, and snail 10 followed the path of snail 12 over
a distance of 50 cm. In both instances, the 2 snails burrowed back
into the sand adjacent to each other.
The length and interval of buried and active periods were
determined for each snail in each of the three sessions (Fig. 3). The
median percent of time spent buried for all the snails was 84%
(SD=21; Range: 34%-97%). The median length of buried periods was
28.6 hours (SD=40.1; Range: 8-152 hours). The median length of
active periods in all three trials was 6 hours (SD=4.3; Range: 2-16
hours). The median movement rate during active periods in the lab
was 16.5 cm per hour (mean-25.1 cm/hr; SD=21; Range: 21-79 cm
per hour). There was no significant correlation between snail sizes
and percent time buried, length of buried period, length of active
period, or movement rate (pÂ»0.16 for all regressions; Figs. 4-7).
Field Activity Patterns
Eight of the fifteen snails from the first tag-and-release trial
were found 18.5 hours later. Of these, 5 snails were buried in the
sand within 1 m of the release point. The other 3 snails had moved
between 622 and 1087 cm and still appeared to be moving. All
three snails were still on sand and had moved in the same direction.
In the second group, 19 of the 20 snails were found within 1.5
hours, 16 were found after 4 hours, and 12 relocated after 73 hours.
