Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Abstract
The predatory gastropod, Kelletia kelletii, was studied in the
lab and in the field to characterize its habitat characteristics,
distribution patterns, activity patterns, and escape responses. The
mean density of Kelletia was 0.32 m-2, and their depth range was
5.5 to 12 m. Snail sizes differed significantly between those found on
rock and on sand: the mean size of snails found on rock was 78.4
mm, while the mean size for snails found on sand was 92.9 mm.
Adult snails in the lab and the field bury themselves for up to 152
hours, punctuated with bursts of activity. There was no significant
relationship between the percent time buried, the length of the
buried period, the length of the active period, or the rate of
movement, and size of the snails. No clear relationship existed
between the activity pattern and foraging, and gut content analysis
was inconclusive. Kelletia captured and consumed Tegula or
Calliostoma ligatum in both the lab and the field. A large mating
aggregation was found during the study. Snails were significantly
larger within this aggregation. Kelletia exhibited no escape response
to three sea stars and a crab.
