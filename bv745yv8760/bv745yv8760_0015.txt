Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Dermasterias imbricata (Rosenthal, 1971). It is possible that, for
similar reasons, the snail does not exhibit an escape response to P.
brevispinus or Pycnopodia helianthoides, although no association
between Pycnopodia and Kelletia has been reported. In addition, the
shell is quite massive in the larger adults, and makes it difficult for
Cancer to break open the shell in order to consume the snail.
The burial period may also be a period of inactivity after
foraging since little or no movement was observed while the snails
were buried. A study conducted on P. giganteus indicates a similar
pattern of inactivity after feeding (Harrold, 1981).
Activity patterns may also be related to the reproductive cycle
of the snail. The active periods of snails in the lab were
characterized mainly by movement in straight lines as indicated by
diatom film trails, covering large distances until an obstacle was
encountered (such as a tank wall). This movement could be a search
for unknown cues indicating the mating aggregation. The snails that
followed each other in Trial 3 along very similar trails in the activity
pattern tanks indicate the snails may be responding to a mating cue.
The cue may be in the mucus secreted by the snails; Rosenthal
(1970) speculates that this may be the case as well. Future
characterization of the mucus would determine the validity of this
idea.
There may also be a behavioral hierarchy of activity and
foraging, depending on the reproductive condition. During nonÂ¬
mating times of the year, activity patterns of the snail may be
determined by foraging needs. Once mating cues have occurred, the
activity pattern may be governed mainly by searching for mates.
