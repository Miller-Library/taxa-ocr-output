length, presumably feeding. The prey, however, could not be
determined.
Mating Aggregation Observations
The density of snails in the mating aggregation (Location 2, Fig.
1) was 260 snails m-2. The mean size of the snails observed in the
aggregation was 89.9 mm (SD=8.3; n=68; Range: 74-115 mm; Fig. 8).
The mean size of Kelletia outside the aggregation (on sand and rock)
was 84.4 mm (n=68; SD=15.0; Range: 36-122). The difference in snail
sizes between the two populations was significant (t-test with
unequal variances; pæ0.01).
Escape Response Studies
Kelletia exhibited no escape response to Pycnopodia or P.
brevispinus in the laboratory. On three occasions Pycnopodia
climbed over the snail, its tube feet making contact with the snail's
foot; in each instance, the snail showed no reaction. On one other
occasion, the P. brevispinus passed one arm over a Kelletia, also
coming in contact with the snail’s foot. Again, the snail showed no
escape response to the sea star. In the field, P. giganteus was placed
in contact with a snail on two occasions. The snails showed no
response either time. In addition, one tagged Kelletia was found
underneath a P. giganteus, although the sea star was not feeding on
it. The snail was not obviously trying to escape.
Kelletia placed in the tank with the crab Cancer antennarius
also did not exhibit escape responses. The Cancer succeeded in
breaking off a few shards from the lip of the shell, but never actually
