Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
During this time, feeding may become secondary. Two lines of
indirect evidence support this idea. The four snails with empty
guts
had very well-developed gonads and were active (rather than
buried) when collected. In addition, in the lab five Kelletia with
Tegula available for consumption spent all their time mating and
laying eggs, suggesting that mating had taken a priority over feeding.
Observations at non-mating times of the year would clarify the
possibility of such a hierarchy of behavior.
Mating Aggregation Observations
The larger mean size of snails within the aggregation than
outside the aggregation indicates that only sexually mature
(represented by larger) individuals are present in the mating
aggregation. No snail inside the aggregation was smaller than 70 mm
(Fig. 8). This can be approximated as the sexual maturity threshold
for K. kelletii. This data is roughly consistent with data from
southern California, which show the smallest snail in a mating
aggregation to be 62 mm in length (Rosenthal, 1970).
Whatever cues may be in effect for the mating aggregation
work over a large distance and seem fairly specific considering three
snails from the original tagged group were observed withing meters
of each other. However, the cues remain undescribed and identifying
them would be a very interesting avenue of research. The activity
patterns of all the snails at non-mating times of the year would be
very informative as well.
