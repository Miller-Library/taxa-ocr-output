n=21), or 0.32 m-2. The depths at which the snails were found
ranged from 5.5 m to 12 m, with the majority of snails deeper than
7.5 m.
The snails were found on both rocks and sand. Rock locations
included rocks ranging in size from small fist-sized rocks to large
boulders, and sand beds included bare sand, mats of the tubiculous
polychaete, Diopatra ornata, and sand channels between rock
outcroppings. The mean length of snails found on the sand was 92.9
mm (SD=12.0, n=15), while the mean for rock locations was 78.4 mm
(SD=14.8, n=26, Fig. 2). The size difference between the two
populations was significant (t-test with unequal variances; p√¶0.01).
Lab Activity Patterns
The snails in the lab characteristically buried themselves for
extended periods of time, punctuated with bursts of activity in which
the snails would move around the tank (Fig. 3). The snails ranged in
size from 79 mm to 97 mm, and all snails buried themselves
completely in the substrate at least once during the observation
periods. When burying, the front edge of the foot dug into the sand
and pulled sand up over the front edge of the foot. The siphonal
canal was pulled completely under the surface of the substrate, and
the snail then rocked the shell in a spiraling motion until burial was
complete. Once burrowing began, all snails were buried within 15
minutes. The siphon was extended out of the sand only once out of
25 observed burial events.
Activity patterns varied substantially among individual snails.
Several remained buried for a very long time and became active only
