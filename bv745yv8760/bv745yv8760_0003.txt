Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Population Studies
Random sampling was conducted to determine the population
density of Kelletia in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. Random
compass bearings and kick cycles (ranging from 5 to 50,
approximately 1 meter per kick) were used to determine sampling
locations. The type of substrate, depth, number, and size of the
Kelletia were recorded for each 5-m2 circular quadrat. Quadrat
counts were continued until the slope of mean versus number of
quadrats approached zero (21 quadrats).
Lab Activity Patterns
A tank measuring 230 cm x 110 cm x 40 cm (water level
maintained at 20 cm height) was used to track four Kelletia at a time
to observe activity patterns. Their activity periods, distances and
directions were recorded. Trial 1 was conducted for 65 hours, with
four snails with distinct markings placed in different locations in the
tank. A dead smelt was placed on the sand next to the inlet pipe
approximately 27 hours after the start of the observation period. At
the end of the observation period, the dead smelt was removed and
the tank flushed with fresh seawater before the Trial 2 was begun.
Trial 2 lasted for 216 hours. Four new snails were used and
were tagged with waterproof epoxy. The snails were placed next to
each other in the center of the tank. A dead smelt was added to the
tank next to the inlet pipe after 124 hours.
Trial 3 lasted 74 hours. In this case the dead smelt was in the
tank to begin with and remained in the tank for the duration of the
