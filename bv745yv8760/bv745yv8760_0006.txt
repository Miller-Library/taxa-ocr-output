Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
times at haphazardly selected points in the aggregation. The number
of snails within each quadrat was recorded, and 68 snails were
collected for size measurement.
Escape Response Studies
To assess whether habitat utilization may be influenced by
interactions with predators, Kelletia escape responses to the sea stars
Pycnopodia helianthoides, Pisaster brevispinus, and Pisaster
giganteus, and to the crab, Cancer antennarius were examined. P.
giganteus and Cancer occur primarily in rocky areas, while P.
brevispinus and Pycnopodia inhabit both rocky and sandy
substrates. One Pycnopodia, one P. giganteus, and two Kelletia were
placed in a fresh circulating seawater tank measuring 90cm x 90cm x
60cm (water level maintained at 25cm height). One Kelletia was
placed with two Cancer in a separate tank with the same
measurements. The snails were allowed to move freely in the tank
along with the two sea stars and the crab. Observations were
recorded for five days in each of the tanks. The escape response to
P. giganteus was studied in the field during two separate SCUBA
dives, in which the tube feet of P. giganteus were touched to the foot
of Kelletia.

The average density of Kelletia at random sampling locations
within the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge was 1.62 per 5 m2 (SD=2.29,
