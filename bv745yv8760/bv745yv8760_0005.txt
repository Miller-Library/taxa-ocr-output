Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Feeding Studies
Six Kelletia were placed in a tank measuring 50 cm x 50 cm x
30 cm (water level at 28 cm) for five days to observe their feeding
behavior. For the first three days, 5 Tegula montereyi, 5 Tegula
pulligo, 5 Tegula brunnea, and 5 Calliostoma ligatum were placed in a
tank with the Kelletia. On the fourth day, all the Tegula and
Calliostoma were removed and replaced with 10 Tegula pulligo, 10
Tegula brunnea, and 5 Calliostoma ligatum. These were left for two
days. On the sixth day, all non-Kelletia snails were removed. A
second trial was run for two days with a new group of 5 Kelletia
offered 5 T. montereyi, 5 T. brunnea, and 5 T. pulligo. After two
days, all non-Kelletia snails were removed and small glass test tubes
containing invertebrates were placed on their sides in the tank. The
invertebrate specimens were collected from a vertical face of a
subtidal boulder in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, and consisted of
an oyster, a polychaete worm, a tunicate, a sponge, dead polychaete
worm parts, a dead sipunculid worm, a living sipunculid worm, and a
chiton.
In addition to lab observations, Kelletia were examined in the
field to determine whether they were feeding and, if possible,
identify their prey.
Mating Aggregation Observations
On May 17, 1994, a mating aggregation of Kelletia was
observed at Location 2 (Fig. 1). One week later the densities of snails
in the aggregation was measured with a 1/16 m2 quadrat, placed 7
