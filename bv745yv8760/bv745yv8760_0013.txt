Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Further sampling including inspections of sand patches for buried K.
kelletii are necessary to determine the percent of the population
buried at any given time.
No snails smaller than 35 mm were found. In southern
California, juveniles as small as 18 mm were found (Rosenthal, 1971)
Further investigation is required to determine if juvenile snails have
a different distribution than adults in Monterey.
The significant difference in snail sizes on rock and on sand
could indicate a change that favors moving from the rock to the sand
as they grow older. The cues for such a shift are unknown, although
one possibility could be a change in diet. It is also possible that,
since Kelletia are quite mobile snails, the observed differences in
snail sizes between sand and rock habitats are coincidental. Further
sampling and larger sample sizes could clarify this issue.
Lab and Field Activity Patterns
Only Kelletia smaller than 40 mm in length bury themselves in
the substrate in southern California (Rosenthal, 1971). In Monterey
Bay, adult snails (79-97 mm) buried themselves both in the lab and
in the field. The reason for this difference is not known.
Activity patterns may be associated with foraging behavior.
Due to the large proportion of empty stomachs, gut studies did not
reveal whether Kelletia forage while buried or while active.
However, several indirect lines of evidence suggest foraging occurs
during active periods rather than when buried. The Kelletia fed on
prey that they would only encounter while active, namely the
Tegula. In addition, when food was added to the the activity pattern
