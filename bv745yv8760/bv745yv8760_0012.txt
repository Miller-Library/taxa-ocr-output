Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
ate the snail. While being manipulated by the Cancer, the snail did
withdraw into its shell and remained there for some time after
manipulation.
Discussion
The depth distribution of Kelletia kelletii in southern California
ranged from 2 to 40 m (Rosenthal, 1971). This contrasts with
Monterey, where 5.5 m was the shallowest depth at which K. kelletii
was found. Searches at shallower depths yielded no Kelletia. Further
detailed examination of the subtidal zone in the Hopkins Marine Life
Refuge may be necessary to determine the validity of the observed
difference in the upper depth limits. Areas outside the kelp bed
deeper than 12 m were not sampled, so a comparison between the
deeper limits is not possible at this time.
The large standard deviation associated with the mean
density of snails indicates that Kelletia has an aggregated distribution
throughout the kelp forest. Densities of K. kelletii in two southern
California sites were 1.82 m-2 and 0.73 m-2 (Rosenthal,1971),
compared to the 0.32 m-2 observed in the kelp bed in Monterey
This could be related to the recent range extension of K. kelletii into
the area, and the local population has not attained the densities
observed in southern California. Since my study was conducted
during Kelletia’s reproductive season, another possibility is that
many snails were concentrated at the mating aggregation, artificially
decreasing the density estimates. The burial behavior of the snail
may also have lowered the estimated density, since it was not known
at the time of field sampling that adult snails bury themselves.
