Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
tank in Trial 1, three of the four snails emerged within 2 hours and
moved around on the sand, rather than burrowing toward the food.
Possession of such a long, extensible proboscis would allow Kelletia to
feed on buried prey without expending the energy required to
burrow. The snail observed in Diopatra with its proboscis extended
was feeding in this manner. The snail in Trial 2 may have done
likewise to feed on the fish from below. Finally, snails were
stationary while buried in the tanks, suggesting they were not
actively seeking food.
Why the burial occurs is unclear. Burial may be a defense
against predation. Juvenile Kelletia bury themselves to avoid contact
with P. giganteus, although they do not bury in direct response to
contact with the sea star (Rosenthal, 1971). The decreasing trends of
percent time buried and average length of burial interval with
increasing size (Figs. 4, 5) may also support a defensive function for
burial, since larger individuals are often less susceptible to predation
(Paine, 1976). Further sampling is required to confirm these
observed trends.
Alternatively, burial may be unrelated to predation. Snails
buried themselves in the complete absence of predators and showed
no escape responses to any of the predators tested. Lack of an
escape response is typical of southern California individuals as well
(Rosenthal, 1971). Although P. giganteus has been observed to eat
Kelletia, the lack of an escape response is not surprising since a
trophic association (i.e. communal feeding on the same prey item)
between these two species has been described (Rosenthal, 1971)
Kelletia associate with two other sea stars, Pisaster brevispinus and
