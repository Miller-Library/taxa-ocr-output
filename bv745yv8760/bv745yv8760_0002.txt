Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Introduction
Kellet's whelk, Kelletia kelletii, is a large predatory
neogastropod found in the subtidal zone to depths of 70 m. It grows
up to 170mm in length and has a heavy, bulky, thick shell. It has a
long, extensible proboscis used for feeding, which can be extended up
to 3 times the length of its shell. The foot is very muscular, and is
colored yellow with white speckles and black lines around the edge
of the foot (Morris et. al., 1980).
Kelletia was, until 1980, primarily a southern California species.
In 1980, the first snails were discovered in the Monterey Bay area,
and have since grown in abundance and can commonly be found in
offshore reefs in the area (Herrlinger, 1981). Little is known of the
behavior and life history of Kelletia, and what little work has been
carried out has been performed in southern California. Its trophic
association with Pisaster giganteus has been studied (Rosenthal,
1971), as has its reproductive biology (Rosenthal, 1970).
This study examined the habitat of K. kelletii, its local
distribution, and its activity patterns in the lab and field to
determine if major differences exist between the expanding edge of
the species' range and the central portion of its range.
Materials and Methods
The study was carried out at the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University in Pacific Grove, California during April and May
1994. Field studies were conducted in the Hopkins Marine Life
Refuge offshore from the station (Fig. 1).
