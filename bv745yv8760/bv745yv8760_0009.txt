Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Nine snails were found either half-buried or completely buried at the
first two observation times, while 6 snails were found buried in
similar positions after 73 hours. Three of the 12 snails recovered
after 73 hours had moved onto rocks from the sand, one of which
was associated with a P. giganteus. Neither the snail nor the sea star
were feeding.
The 3 snails from the first tagged group and the 8 snails from
the second tagged group that exhibited marked movement were used
to calculate the field movement rate. The median movement rate in
the field was 40 cm per hour (SD=18.1; Range: 11-87 cm per hour).
This rate was not significantly different from laboratory estimates (t-
test assuming unequal variances; p=0.31).
Approximately two weeks after release, 3 snails from the first
group of tagged snails were observed at least 40 meters away from
the original release point (Location 1, Fig. 1). These three snails were
at a mating aggregation (Location 2, Fig. 1).
Gut content analysis and feeding
Only one of five snails had food in its gut. The contents could
not be identified. This snail was collected from the sand but was not
buried. The other four snails, two collected from the sand and two
from the rock, all had empty guts. The gut content analysis was thus
inconclusive. However, four of the five snails were reproductively
ripe. The fifth snail lacked a gonad and the inner surface of the shell
was encrusted in the area where the gonad would have been.
During the activity studies, Kelletia fed on the fish placed in the
tank on two occasions: one snail sat on the fish for a period of hours,
