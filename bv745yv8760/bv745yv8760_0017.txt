Stevenson: Natural History of Kelletia
Acknowledgements
I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to Dr. Jim Watanabe of
Hopkins Marine Station for the invaluable assistance provided,
without which this project would have been completely
unmanageable. Advice on subtidal methods and help in improving
this paper are greatly appreciated. Thanks also to Gary Villa of
Powers Lab at the Hopkins Marine Station for allowing me to
convince him to spend more time underwater than is probably
healthy for a human being. Finally, I would like to thank all the
people at the Marine Station who made my three month stay there
one of the most memorable events of my life.
