more data is needed to support this, particularly considering the springtime upwelling in
Monterey Bay which would have effected water temperature more strongly.
Wind speed, which effects swell intensity, showed no correlation whatsoever with
bacterial abundance (r*2=.017). These were not analyzed any further, although it would be
interesting in a future study to investigate bacterial community composition based on windÂ¬
driven mixing.
When both sets of bacterial abundance data were compared to the number of seals on the
beach at the time of sampling (Figure 6), fewer seals seemed to correlate with higher amounts of
bacteria (with an r22 value of .94 in the comparison between seal counts and bacterial daily
means from microscope counts), when it was expected that more seals would mean more fecal
production, and therefore more bacteria in the water.
Discussion:
The microscope and flowcytometer counts showed many similar patterns in daily
variation of bacterial abundance, but the comparison of the two counts showed some distinct
differences as well (Figure 1). Differences between the results obtained from both may be due to
the fact that the water analyzed using the flow cytometer was not pre-filtered before the bacteria
counts were taken, so larger cells and pieces of phytoplankton may have been counted in the
sample. Any particles larger than 6um were filtered out of the sample before microscope counts
were taken, minimizing the potential for larger cells or particles to be included in the counts. In
addition, many of the flowcytometer samples showed a population of unstained cells (Figure 4),
likely Synechococcus cyanobacteria, which would not have been detectable in the microscope
counts.
