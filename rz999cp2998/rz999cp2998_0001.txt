Abstract:
Levels of fecal-associated bacteria that may be harmful to human health can be very high
near haul-out sites of marine mammals. Water from sites near Seal Beach at Hopkins Marine
Station and from varying distances from the haul-out site was tested for bacterial abundance with
both epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and was not found to have increased total
numbers of bacteria near the haul-out site, even though it has been shown that the microbial
community at these sites is different than others around Monterey Bay. There was, however,
significant variation in bacterial abundance based on the day the sample was taken. Various
environmental factors including number of seals on the beach, water temperature, air
temperature, and wind speed were compared to the daily mean bacterial abundance counts to test
for a significant effect. Sea surface temperature was found to have the strongest correlation on
bacterial abundance of the factors tested.
