Introduction:
Water quality in coastal areas is frequently monitored to ensure human health and safety
in recreational or seafood-producing areas (Boehme 2005). Human activities can cause high
levels of pathogenic bacteria in coastal seawater, but many other factors contribute to bacterial
abundance as well (Stewart 2008). Marine mammal haul-out sites have been cited as a cause of
high levels of fecal-associated bacteria, due to the high density of animal feces being introduced
to the water (Calambokidis 1987). In winter 2011, the microbiology class at Hopkins Marine
station used 4-5-4 sequencing to examine bacterial community composition in various sites
around Monterey Bay. Seal Beach at Hopkins, so named because of the hundreds of harbor seals
that use it as a haul-out site, had a significantly different bacterial composition than any of the
other sites tested (Hopkins Marine Station, unpublished data). This study examines bacterial
abundance at the Seal Beach site and many sites nearby, to test if proximity to the seal haul-out
location would increase bacterial abundance, as well as change community composition. The
data were tested against a statistical null hypothesis that bacterial abundance was unaffected by
proximity to seal beach. In addition, other environmental factors that may have an effect on
bacterial abundance, such as time and weather conditions were examined over the course of the
study and compared to variability in bacteria counts. The number of seals was expected to
positively correlate with bacterial counts, as more fecal production would likely increase
bacterial concentration. Wind speed was expected to effect swell height and water mixing (Pinet
2005), which could possibly suggest that high winds could cause bacteria created at the beach to
be flushed out to sea, decreasing bacterial abundance (Boehme 2005). The temperature factors
were measured and compared post hoc, and had no initial hypothesis attached to them.
