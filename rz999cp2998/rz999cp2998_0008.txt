beachgoers and seafood consumers caused by the seal haul-outs, water should be tested for fecal
bacteria, and the bacterial community in this water can be better analyzed.
Acknowledgements:
I would first like to thank Dr. Vanessa Michelou and Dr. Sarah Lee for their valuable
feedback and support of this project throughout. I would also like to thank Professor Steve
Palumbi for his supervision of the project, and the rest of the Hopkins Marine Station faculty for
their feedback, especially Professor James Watanabe for teaching me how to do the statistics for
this project. In addition, I would like to thank Brandon Carter for allowing me to use the
MEGAMER flowcytometer, and Chris Patton for helping me use the microscope. Finally, I
would like to thank my classmates Acata Felton, lan Markham, and Walker Clayton for their
contributions to my learning experience.
