Abundaces were estimated with a BD Influx: Four-Laser Flowcytometer (MEGAMER, UCSC)
equipped with an air-cooled argon laser (488 nm, 25 mW). I analyzed scatter plots of particle
fluorescence using FlowJo software, and found 3 distinct populations of bacteria in most
samples, although all of the samples from May 16 and 17, as well as some of the samples from
May 2, only showed 2 distinct bacterial populations in addition to the beads.
In addition to bacterial counts, I obtained data on conditions at the time of sampling
including wind speed, air temperature, and sea surface temperature from the Hopkins Marine
Life Observatory Weather Station and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography Wave and
Temperature buoy. I counted the seals on Seal Beach at the time of sampling for five out of the
eight sampling days. Daily means and site means from both the flowcytometer counts and the
microscope counts from each sampling day were compared with a single-factor ANOVA.
Significant ANÖVA results were tested again with a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Linear
regressions were performed to test correlation between the bacteria count data sets and the
environmental factors (wind speed, air temperature, water temperature, and seal count).
Results:
The bacterial counts from the microscope and from the flow cytometer showed very
similar patterns for each sample (Figure 2), and served as a control to ensure both sampling
methods detected the same variation between sites and sampling days.
The variability between sites was not significant by a single-factor ANÖVA in either the
microscope counts or the flowcytometer data (Figure 3). Therefore, the null hypothesis that
distance from Seal Beach does not effect bacterial abundance was supported. There was,
however, a great deal of temporal variation, and a single-factor ANÖVA analyzing the day of
sampling was significant for microscope bacterial counts at the .05 level. Flowcytometer daily
