Methods:
I chose seven sites in the Hopkins Marine Reserve for sampling, and numbered them O-
6, with site 0 on Seal Beach, and site 6 the farthest from Seal Beach (Figure 1).
I sampled Site 0 only once during the experiment to minimize disturbance of the seals,
while I sampled site 1 a total of eight times to get a stronger temporal resolution of bacterial
variation close to the loading site as well as the weather station (ancillary data source). Sites 4
5, and 6 were sampled four times over a three week period, while sites 2 and 3 were sampled
three times each, with one sample taken from a site halfway between sites 2 and 3, called site
2.5, sampled on April 27, due to a high wave that caused me to lose my sampling bottle at site 2.
I collected water at high tide in IL plastic bottles. In the lab, I fixed 57 mL of each sample with
3mL 16% paraformaldehyde solution and refrigerated it overnight. I then filtered this through a
0.6um filter. 30mL of this filtrate was then filtered again through a 0.22um black polycarbonate
filter and stained with 2% DAPI saline solution (according to the Kirchman 2009 protocol). The
filter was then mounted on a slide, so that there were two filter slides for every sample. 1
counted bacteria on the slides in ten fields of view using a Nikon FXA microscope fitted with
DAPI filter 31000 (Chroma). The mean of 20 total fields of view was taken and compared for
each sample. One 60 mL sample of deionized water was also filtered, stained, and counted as a
control.
For flow-cytometric analyses, I fixed 1.5 mL of each unfiltered sample with 100uL of
16% PFA solution in 2mL vials and froze them until a trip to the flowcytometer could be
arranged. Once the samples thawed, I stained them with the cell-permanent, green-fluorescent
SYTO BC nucleic acid stain for 2 to 5 minutes in the dark. I then added 1OuL of a solution
containing 6um beads for comparison before the sample was run through the flowcytometer.
