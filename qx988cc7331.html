ment seems random; they are neither attracted to nor
repelled by each other. There is a net movement upward
and towards a light, if this is not too intense. These
actions may even lead the spat to crawl out of the water,
where they dessicate and die within 15 to 20 minutes on
a sunny day. It is perhaps an advantage, therefore, for
L
the newly hatched spat to be washed off the host Tegula


funebralis, which is normally exposed during the tidal
cycle. Sunlight alone has no effect on the newly hatched
Crepidula adunca when they are immersed.



The spat are very active even in still water, and their
random movements tend to disperse them. Simple dis-
persal experiments were carried out in eight finger bowls
with newly hatched young. Ten juveniles were placed in
the center of each bowl and their positions marked on
a grid at five minute intervals. Average motility, based on

these runs, is plotted in Figure 2. Maximum rate of loco¬
motion measured over a short distance was about 0.2
mm/sec.

The egg cases themselves may be expelled immediately
at the end of hatching, which takes approximately one
half hour, or after several days. Not all egg capsules
under a given female are necessarily at the same stage of
development or hatch at the same time.
