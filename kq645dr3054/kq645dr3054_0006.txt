In order to test for the presence of biogenic monoamines
in the neural gland or surrounding tissues, specimens of A.
geratodes similar to those used in the histological studies
were treated with glyoxylic acid according to the technique
described by de la Torre and Surgeon (1976). Treated
specimens were cut on the cryostat into 10 micron serial
sections and mounted on microscope slides. These slides
were then examined under the UV fluorescence microscope with
various filters.
RESULTS
Observations on currents around the dorsal tubercle
Currents around the dorsal tubercle of Ascidia ceratodes
made a vortex-like pattern as shown in figure 3A. Particles
drawn towards the tubercle were thrown away from or swirled
back onto the tubercle. These graphite particles stuck to
mucous covering the tubercle and the graphite-laden mucous
formed a strand that moved towards the dorsal lamina,
ultimately joining the mucous strands of the peripharyngeal
grooves (figure 3B).
Observations on soaked and injected preparations
Of the five dissections soaked in Neutral Red dye, three
were ligated and two were unligated. All five showed obvious
staining in the pharynx, tubercle, and tentacles, but very
little, if any, in the gland. In a similar experiment using
fluorescein dye, ligated and unligated specimens were
examined in a dark room under a hand-held UV light. Although
