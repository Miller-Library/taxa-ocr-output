INTRODUCTION
The neural gland complex of ascidians is located in the
intersiphonal region between the branchial basket and the
body wall. This complex consists of a lobed gland, a ciliated
tubercle-funnel, and a canal connecting the two. The tubercle
is anterior to the gland and opens into the pharynx just
above the junction of the peripharyngeal grooves (figure 1).
The gland itself lies next to or near the ganglion, and a
tube called the dorsal strand runs posteriorly from the
gland and possibly to the gonads. Although the neural gland
has been observed since the late nineteenth century and has
been thoroughly reviewed by Ivan Goodbody (1974), its function
remains unknown. Many studies approach this urochordate
organ as a possible precursor or homolog to one of the
vertebrate gland systems, but essentially no evidence for any
such homology has been generated. Without disregarding
previous speculations, the present study is based on direct
observations of the ascidian neural gland complex in live
dissections and histological preparations. Some preliminary
histochemical and physiological tests provide suggestive
leads for further investigation of the nature of this gland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ascidia ceratodes (Order Enterogona) was used for living
observations. Specimens were collected from dock floats in
the Monterey Marina during April and May and were kept in a
