AKNOWLEDGEMENT
Many glandfuls of thanks go to Prof. William Ph.* Gilly
for his generous assistance, as well as to Prof. Donald P. Abbott
for his dedication and lessons in noodle enzymology. I would
especially like to thank Mr. Keith Kohatsu, the TWTA, for histological
heroism and general incredible output, and Chris Patton for yet
more histology instruction. Finally, I would like to thank my
classmates of the Bio 175H class 1981 and all others at Hopkins
who helped make this an outrageously enjoyable quarter
as in Pheromone
