unstained except for a few blood cells stained red, and still
others had glandsof intermediate appearance. One specimen
of particular interest had a fairly empty gland and a clot
of stained cells in the canal just below the tubercle.
Whole animals soaked in methylene blue had glands that
distinctly concentrated the blue color more than any other
organ or tissue, although the tunic stained dark blue. Once
again, different degrees of staining were observed. For
example, one gland was largely empty of stained cells and had
clear, bubble-like lobes rimmed with some stained cells, while
a few other glands were very compact and stained dark blue.
In one preparation a clump of blue cells was observed to
loosen from the gland, spiral up the canal, and go out the
ciliated funnel-tubercle. The clump then joined the mucous
strand on the tubercle and moved as part of the strand towards
the dorsal lamina. These discharged cells were very similar
in appearance to stained cells in the gland itself when the
two cell samples were examined under the compound microscope.
In summary, it would seem that fluorescein does not
get trapped in the lumen of the gland when applied externally,
but that Neutral Red and methylene blue can gain access to
the gland cells via some route and stain them. Unspecific
staining by Neutral Red in vital preparations make it a
poor choice for the appointed task, but methylene blue seems
to work well for semi-specific staining of the neural gland.
