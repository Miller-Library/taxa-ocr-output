Observations of histological preparations
Many interesting features of the ganglions and neural
gland complexes of S. montereyensis and A. ceratodes were
observed in the 2-4 micron sections of the two species.
Longitudinal sections of Styela and transverse cuts of both
Styela and Ascidia were examined at 100X and 400X dry
magnification and 1000X oil-immersion magnification.
Although connective tissue separated gland and ganglion
over most of the gland-ganglion interface, sites of contact
where gland cells seemed to merge with those of the ganglion
and vice versa were evident in several places. One of these
sites was photographed through a Zeiss light microscope at
the three magnificationspreviously mentioned and is shown
in figures 4A through 4E. The sections depicted are 2-1
micron longitudinal slices through the neural gland and
ganglion of Styela montereyensis, and the entire series
spans a thickness of 20-30 microns.
Figure 4A shows part of a section oriented with the
dorsal surface at the top of the photograph. The gland
appears as a mottled triangular projection sandwiched between
the body wall above and the ganglion below. Part of the
ciliated funnel-tubercle can be seen on the ventral surface
of the ganglion. The area enclosed in the white box includes
a ganglion-gland cellular bridge and is viewed at higher
magnification in figures 4B through 4E.
