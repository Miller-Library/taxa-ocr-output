coupled with the evidence from histological peparations of
gland-ganglion cellular bridges, would suggest that the two
organs exchange substances related to neurotransmitters.
Results of the histofluorescence test partially support
such
speculations in that fluorescence, implying a corresponding
presence of biogenic monoamines, was observed around the
periphery of the ganglion. The test did not demonstrate the
presence of any such substances in the negral gland, however,
and repetitions of this experiment by experienced fluorescence
histochemists are desireable.
Continuation of the histofluorescence studies on the
neural gland complex and elaboration of the smooth muscle
experiments should be coupled with electron microscopy
of the gland-ganglion interface. Such studies would provide
valuable information on the chemical and structural nature
of this region. Depending on the results; this information
could then be used to determine the function of the tunicate
neural gland.
