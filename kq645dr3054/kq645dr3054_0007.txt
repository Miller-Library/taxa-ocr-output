the ganglion, tubercle, pharynx, and blood tissues all glowed.
those of the neural gland did not. This would seem to
indicate that the gland had not sequestered fluorescein from
the surrounding water in either preparation, although the
bright glow of the ganglion may have overshone any glow
emanating from the gland.
Injection experiments gave erratic results. Sometimes
the dye went into the gland, sometimes into the dorsal vessel.
Once the dye was in the gland it usually stayed there, although
fluorescein was observed to fade, making detection difficult.
While retention of injected methylene blue could be caused by
specific staining of neural gland cells, retention of
fluorescein cannot be so easily explained. Either fluorescein
is actively taken up by the gland or else diffusional communi-
cation from the site of injection to the tubercle is limited.
Of the three dyes tried, fluorescein was the least retained.
These experiments are thus inconclusive but do suggest a
possibly fruitful, albeit technically difficult, avenue of
approach.
Whole soaked animals gave interesting results. Like
soaked injections, animals soaked in fluorescein glowed in
the ganglion, tubercle, pharynx, and blood when viewed under
UV light, but did not glow significantly in the gland.
Animals soaked in a mixture of Neutral Red and methylene blue
showed red staining of the pharynx, blood, and tubercle, but
the appearance of the gland varied. Some had glands full of
blue and red stained cells,yothers had glands virtually
