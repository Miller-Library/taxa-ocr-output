the gland extract effect, application of filtered sea water
as a control did not have a significant effect. (figure 5,
bottom panel). Contractions were transiently reduced and
stabilized at 90% of the force in high calcium. Neural gland
extract thus appears to have a reversible smooth muscle
relaxant effect in this preliminary experiment, and further
tests are desireable.
Observations on histofluorescence tests
Using the glyoxylic acid fluorescence technique of
de la Torre and Surgeon (1976), 10 micron longitudinal sections
of the neural gland region were examined under the UV
fluorescence microscope. The inner periphery of the ganglion
was seen to glow a greenish yellow when excited by light of
450 nm wavelength, but gland tissue was not observed to
fluoresce. Resolution in this preparation was not fine
enough to determine if gland cells in the gland-ganglion
bridge regions fluoresced. Cells in the interior of the
gland did not glow, although blood cells, probably vanadoÂ¬
cytes, fluoresced bright yellow.
DISCUSSION
Although none of the above testsconclusively demonstrate
the function of the ascidian neural gland complex, many of
the results provide useful starting points for further investi-
gations. The study also introduces some innovative techniques
for working with this elusive little organ.
