The neural gland complex of Ascidia ceratodes lies ventral
to the ganglion (figure 2), hence the animal must be dissected
to get direct access to the gland. Dissections were per¬
formed by removing the animal from its tunic and cutting the
body wall lengthwise from the oral siphon down the left side
of the endostyle. Care was taken not to injure the heart or
other organs. The opened animal was then pinned with three
stainless steel minuten pins to a petri dish half-filled with
Sylgard (Dow-Corning), a soft, clear plastic. The dissections
could thus be viewed with illumination from all angles under
both dissecting and compounds microscopes.
Most histological examinations were performed on Styela
montereyensis (Order Pleurogona). In this species the gland
lies dorsal to the ganglion in a potentially convenient
location for external operations. Because the animal
chronically contracted in response to cutting the tunic,
however, attempts to approach the gland by shaving away the
tunic between the siphons were unsuccessful.
Several techniques were employed to observe the nature
of communication between the gland complex and the rest of
the animal. The dorsal tubercle provided the first site of
study. Currents around this ciliated tubercle-funnel were
traced by introducing a solution of graphite particles
suspended in phytoplankton culture near the tubercle of a
dissected preparation.
