5 NC
were fixed and embedded according to procedures outlined in
the data sheet of the JB-4 plastic embedding kit (Polysciences,
Inc. Warrington, PA). A specimen from Ascidia and one from
Styela were cut in 2-4 micron transverse sections and another
tyela specimen was cut in 2-4 micron longitudinal sections.
An average of fifteen slices were expanded in ammoniated water
on each microscope slide, after which the water was evaporated
off over a Bunsen burner. Slides with sections thus mounted
were then stained by the Lee's methylene-blue-basic fuchsin
method also outlined in the JB-4 embedding kit data sheet.
Giving stained slides a subsequent rinse in 95% ethanol for
roughly half a minute followed by a rinse in distilled water
proved effective for removing excess stain from the embedding
plastic. Balsam was used to mount the cover slips because
it has an optical density close to that of JB-4 plastic.
Slides were observed and photographed under a Zeiss compound
microscope.
Extract made from 15 glands of A. ceratodes ground in
I ml of sea water was applied to a smooth muscle preparation
of Ciona intestinalis used by Gabrielle Nevitt in her smooth
muscle studies of 1981. Twitch amplitude of the muscle strip
in 60mM calcium solution was first measured. Extract was next
applied to the preparation and the change in twitch ampli-
tude was determined. The gland extract was then washed out
with the high calcium sea water and full recovery was
obtained. The experiment was repeated using filtered sea
water as a control
