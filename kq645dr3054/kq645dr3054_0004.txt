to a hypodermic needle with a hot glue gun (Sears, Roebuck Inc).
The fine tip of the pipette was inserted down the canal via
the lower lip of the ciliated funnel and pressure was
applied manually with a bulb until stain was seen to enter
the gland.
In order to avoid artifacts introduced by the process of
dissection, experiments were also performed on intact animals.
Ten Ascidia ceratodes were soaked overnight in one of four
dye-sea water solutions: methylene blue, Neutral Red, methylene
blue plus Neutral Red, or fluorescein. The specimens were
then rinsed for several hours in fresh running sea water and
dissected. Glands were monitored until the preparations
died.
Preliminary enzyme assays were conducted on neural gland
extract in order to test for digestive activity in the gland.
Drops of the extract, prepared by grinding ten freshly
isolated glands in 1 ml. of sea water, were placed on the
emulsion side of exposed black-and-white photographic film
and on tiny pieces of semolina macaroni noodles (Golden Grain).
Drops of 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001% protease in sea water were
placed on the film and noodle substrates as controls. These
preparations were kept in a moisture chamber and observed
every hour for a few hours. They were then left in the
chambers overnight
Both A. ceratodes and Styela montereyensis were used for
histological studies. Rectangular pieces of body wall
including gland, tubercle, ganglion, and attached pharynx
