Figures 4B-4E are photos of four pseudo-serial longitudinal
sections through the gland-ganglion bridge in figure 4A at
higher (400X) magnification. The section shown in JE is
reversed, an artifact of its placement on the microscope
slide. Once again, ganglion lies below the dark, triangular
projection of gland tissue, and cells of the beginning of a
nerve can be seen at the top
of the photo. A connective
tissue layer separating the gland and ganglion can be seen
to the right of the cellular bridge, but this layer becomes
obscure and disappears where the gland and ganglion cells
merge.
Also of interest are the cell types in the gland and
ganglion. Both bear large, dark inclusions, and the
ganglion cells often seem to be empty. Gland cells in these
sections are not well delineated except for what appear to be
nuclei (the dark inclusions), however the cells are distinct
from those of the surrounding tissues, namely muscle and
ganglion. In regions where ganglion and gland cells
make direct contact, this distinction is often lost.
Observations on smooth muscle relaxant properties of gland
As outlined in the methods, extract of neural gland of
Ascidia ceratodes was applied to smooth muscle preparations
of Ciona intestinalis and changes in twitch force in response
to brief electrical shock were noted. The top panel of
figure 5 shows that gland extract seems to have caused the
contractions of the smooth muscle preparation to rapidly
decrease and stabilize at half the force of the control
contractions in high calcium solution. After reversing
