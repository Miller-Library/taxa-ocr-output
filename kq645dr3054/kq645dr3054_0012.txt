Vortex currents around the tubercle and the occurrence
of cells exiting the gland via the canal are supportive
evidence for earlier claims that material moves from the
gland and into the pharynx. Although cells leaving the gland
were seen to join the mucous food rope system, no digestive
enzymes were detected by crude assays performed on gland
extracts. It would appear that the gland does not function
as a digestive organ.
Histological observations made in this study indicate
that there are several sites of cellular connection, even
fusion, between the tunicate ganglion and neural gland of
two solitary ascidians, namely Styela montereyensis and
Ascidia ceratodes. Although resolution under the light
microscope was not fine enough to detect clear axonal
connections between the two organs, such intimate cellular
contact implies some form of communication. It is possible
that gland cells release substances to other tissues or organs,
for instance the ganglion, and are then discharged out the
canal and into the food rope, where they are eventually ingested.
The stained granular bodies seen in gland cells of animals
soaked in methylene blue may participate in such a secretory
process.
The relaxant effect of neural gland extract on tunicate
smooth muscle provides a clue as to the nature of the gland
cell contents. For instance, it is known that some monoamines
(Prosser 1974
have a relaxant effect on smooth muscle.A The presence of
biogenic monoamines in the neural gland complex or ganglion
