INTRODUCTION
Much of the investigation concerning the pigmentation of the
Crustacea has been centered on the decapods although some recert
investigations have been made on species of both copepods (Herring,
1967) and isopods (Lee, 1966a & b). In the majority of these studies
astaxanthin (4-4'-di-keto, 3-3'-di-hydroxy/-carotene) has been
found to be very abundant and more or less characteristic of the
class. Furthermore, the presence of astaxanthin in the form of
protein complexes has been shown to be frequently linked to rø¬
productive and developmental processes (Cheesman, et al, 1966).
Some research on the pigmentation of stalked barnacles (Class
Cirripedia) has been carried out by Ball (1911) and Fox and
Crozier (1967). Ball's study revealed that the blue pigment in
the ovaries and developing embryos of Lepas fascicularis is a
carotenoprotein with astaxanthin attached to euglobuin. Fox and
Crozier discovered that a similar blue color found in the body of
L. fascicularis is likewise the result of an astaxanthin protein
complex. These two complexes are typical carotenoproteins, both
showing absorption maxima as a broad band at about 600mu. [Cheesman,
et al, 1966). Furthermore, in Ball's study the developing nauplii
were found to change color from blue to pink, reprèsenting the
liberation of astaxanthin from the protein complex. Green (1965)
has suggested that this breakdown of the carotenoprotein during
development, a process commonly seen to occur in crustaceans, may
coincide with the peak of proteinase activity and thus represent
a mechanism during development by which protein stores can be re¬
leased to the embryos at specific stages of development.
The present investigation of Pollicipes polymerus was prompted
by the similarity of this barnacle's bright orange stalk fluid to
