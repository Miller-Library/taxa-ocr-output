Protein Comple
Phosphate buffer extracts of the orange stalk fluid yield an
orange water soluble pigment with a single absorption maximum in
the visible range at about 170mu (Fig 2). This orange pigment was
precipitated with saturated ammonium sulfate and after centrifuga-
tion the resulting pellet was redissolved in distilled water and
run through a DEAE-cellulose column as outlined earlier. The
solution eluted from the column with distilled water but left
behind some orange material believed to be lipid in character,
which could not be eluted even with the addition of methanol.
The
material which had eluted still retained some of its original
orange color, but upon standing overnight turned yellow. An
acetone extract was made which freed the carotenoid with the con-
sequent formation of a white flocculent protein precipitate. The
carotenoid was transferred to petroleum ether in which it exhibited
a single absorption peak at 170 mu. When plated against a known
mixture of the carotenoids found in the bodies of adult barnacles
(solvent mixture of 25% acetone-petroleum ether), astaxanthin
was found to be the only pigment present.
The presence of the same astaxanthin protein complex was verÂ¬
ified in all three stages of ovigerous lamellae by its unique
spectral characteristics and by thin layer chromatography.
Although no quantitative determinations were carried out the abun-
dance of this protein complex appeared to decrease as the lamellae
matured. No carotenoprotein was found in the bodies of adults.
