Bodies of Mature Adults
The bodies were dissected from the calcarious plates and ex¬
tracted and the pigments separated as outlined above. A total of
six carotenoid pigments were isolated (Fig 1). These were O-caro-
tene, isozeaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, an, astaxanthin ester.
and astaxanthin. The specific characteristics of these pigments
are given below (Table 1).
Fraction 7,/-carotene. Fraction 1 elutes from alumina with 1-23
acetone in petroleum ether as a yellow band. It is epiphasic when
partitioned between both 90% and 95% methanol and petroleum ether.
The absorption spectrum in petroleum ether (119-176mu) is in close
agreement with those reported for /-carotene. (Goodwin, 1951)
Fraction ! is inseparable from known samples of/-carotene when
co-chromatographed on thin layer plates of alumina. On such
chromatographs (using 5% acetone in petroleum ether as the solvent
nixture) both show Re values of 0.98.
Fraction 2, Isozeaxanthin (l-l'-dihydroxy-B-carotene) ? ? Fraction
2 eluted from alumina as a yellow band with 30% acetone in petroleum
ether, slightly ahead of Fraction 3. However, it was seperable from
Fraction 3 on columns of MgO-celite and on such columns could be
eluted with 15% acetone-petroleum ether. It was mostly hypophasic
to 90% methanol and completely hypophasic to 958 methanol both
before and after saponification. When this fraction was plated
gainst a known standard of isozeaxanthin in a 258 acetone-petro-
leum ether mixture, the isozeaxanthin (R.-O.82) plated slightly
ahead of Fraction 2 (R.-O.79). However, large amounts of lipid
present in the sample made identification by thin layer chromato-
graphy difficult. The sample exhibited absorption peaks at.llõmu
