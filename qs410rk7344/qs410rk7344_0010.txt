chromatographically. The same six fractions were again present
although in different proportions.
Ovigerous Lamellae
The ovigerous lamellae were collected and divided into three
groups representing progressively advanced stages of development.
These could be easily denoted by their overt color: bright orange,
yellow, or brown. Bright orange lamellae were found to correspond
to Barnes' (1965) stages A, B, and C. The yellow lamellae paralleled
his D and E stages while the brown lamellae were the same as his
stages G and H.
Carotenoids were extracted from the three groups and chroÂ¬
matographed as outlined earlier. The pigments isolated were -caro-
tene, lutein, zeaxanthin, an astaxanthin ester, and astaxanthin.
No astaxanthin was found, possibly due to the small amount of mater-
ial available.
Quantative Determinations
Table 2 lists the relative amounts of the individual carotenoids
obtained from the bodies of mature and immature barnacles, stalk
fluid, and the three stage of ovigerous lamellae studied. These
are represented as a percentage of the total carotenoid content.
All the carotenoids originally isolated are present in approx-
imately equal amounts in both mature and immature animals. The
carotenoids of the stalk fluid are similar to those of the body ex-
tracts with the exception of almost negligable amounts of the ester
and about 203 more astaxanthin. The early lamellae extracts were
similar to those of the mature bodies except for a slightly higher
amount of -carotene and the absence of isozeaxanthin. When compared
to the earlier lamellar stages the middle and late lamellae exhibit
a 10% increase in astaxanthin and a corresponding decrease of about
16%-20% in lutein and the ester.
