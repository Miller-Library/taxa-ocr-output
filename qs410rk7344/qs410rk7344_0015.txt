could possibly mediate the transport of large water soluble
molecules across lipid bound membranes. Such properties could
be important at the onset of reproduction when the bransfer of
critical supplies for egg production is essential. That a sim-
ilar astaxanthin lipo-protein was found in the developing lamellae
suggests that the protein bound astaxanthin in the stalk fluid
is used in some manner by the nauplii during maturation.
Polymerus' stalk fluid thus appears to act as a store of this as-
taxanthin lipo-protein complex for use during reproduction.
A change in the relative amounts of carotenoid pigments during
development was observed. The percentages of %-carotene and zea-
xanthin seemed to remain roughly the same throughout development.
No isozeax
ithin was detected. Both lutein and the astaxanthin
ester, however, showed a relative decrease in abundance in the late
stages of development. It is not known, though, whether this deÂ¬
cline and the increase in free astaxanthin which was also observed
are actually related. Thus, although the percentage of non-ester-
ilied astaxanthin in the late stages is almost identical with the
percentage of astaxanthin bound to the lipo-protein in the stalk
fluid, it is uncertain whether or not this represents the direct
removal of protein-bound astaxanthin. The possibility of the up-
take of astaxanthin derived from the carotenoid lipo-protein
complex of the stalk fluid exists, but the most likely source of
this free astaxanthin is the breakdown of the lipo-protein complex
found in the early stages or de-esterification.
That carotenoproteins are broken during some stage of devel-
opment is a well known fact. Lwoff (1927) observed the breakage
