STRACT
7. Six crotenoid pigments, -carotene, isozeaxanthin (?), lutein.
zeaxanthin, an astaxanthin ester, and astaxanthin were isolated
from the bodies and stalk fluid of Pollicipes polymerus, althoughi
the proportions differ in each case.
2. Similar extracts of the different developmental stages of
ovigerous lamellae showed the presence of the same six carotenoids
with the exception of isozeaxanthin.
3. A decline of the amount of astaxanthin ester and lutein and the
apparent simultaneous increase of astaxanthin with maturation of
the nauplii was observed.
4. Astaxanthin was found to be bound to a lipo-protein in the stalk
fluid and ovigerous lamellae but not in the bodies.
5. The presence of protein bound astaxanthin in the lamellae
appears to decline with maturation.
0. The involvement of the astaxanthin lipo-protein complex which
is stored in the stalk fluid is discussed.
