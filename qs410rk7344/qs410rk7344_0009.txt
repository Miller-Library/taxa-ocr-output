Fraction 5 - Zeaxanthin. This pigment elutes with lutein from col-
umns of alumina with 70% acetone in petroleum ether. However, when
rechromatographed on Mgô-celite it is clearly separable as an
orange-yellow band above lutein and can be eluted with 60% acetone¬
petroleum ether. Its absorption maxima in petroleum ether are
5Omu and 176mu. It is completely hypophasic to both 903 and 958
methanol. The pigmenttis inseparable from authentic zeaxanthin
but separable from lutein and isozeaxanthin when co-chromatographed
in a 25% acetone-petroleum ether solvent mixture.
Fraction 6 - Astaxanthin. This fraction elutes from columns of
alumina as a purple streak with a 20% mixture of glacial acetic
acid in methanol. The pigment was completely hypophasic in both
908 and 958 methanol both before and after saponification. It was
insepgrable when co-chromatographed with known astacene. Like-
wise, it gave a single absorption maximum in petroleum ether at
170mu which was identical to the spectrum of known aståcene. It
should be noted that up to 30 of the pigment was estimated to be
lost on the column.
Bodies of Immature barnacles
Hilgard (1960) in her study of reproduction in the barnacle
P. polymerus reported that individuals with a breadth of less than
17.2 mmwere never found to produce ovigerous lamellae. Barnacles
smaller than this were collected and the pigments extracted and
seperated. When compared to extracts of mature animals, no dif¬
ference could be found in the kinds of carotenoids isolated.
Stalk Fluid
The dark orange fluid which bathes the ovarian tissue in the
stalk was collected and the carotenoids extracted and separated
