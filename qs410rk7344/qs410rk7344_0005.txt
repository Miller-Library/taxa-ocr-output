a mixture of magnesium oxide and "celite" (1:1 w/w). These columns
were likewise developed with acetone-petroleum ether mixtures.
Pigment Identification
In all cases it was necessary to confirm results by comparing
samples of known carotenoids (kindly supplied by Professor B.C.L.
Weedon, University of London) with the extracted pigments by means
of thin layer chromatography. Shandon equipment was used through-
out and the plates were spread with aluminum oxide (Aluminiumoxid
G-nach Stahl, E. Merck AG., Darmstadt, Deutschland) to a depth of
200mu. The plates were developed in one of four acetone-petroleum
ether mixtures: 5% for carcenes, and 253, 302, and 50% for the diÂ¬
keto and di-hydroxy derivatives. It shoud be noted that the
recorded Re values can be considered as valid for individual
plates only, since identical conditions from plate to plate were
not possible even under the most careful conditions.
Saponification was carried out by dissolving the pigments in
a 12% solution of KOH in methanol, followed by incubation in the
dark at room temperature overnight. After saponification the
pigments were re-extracted with petroleum ether.
The chromatographic and partition characteristics were recorded
and the absorption maxima of the extracted pigments determined in
petroleum ether, diethyl ether and carbon disulfide. A Beckman
DK2A Ratio Recording Spectophotometer was utilized for all such
recordings.
Quantitative determinations were based on the extinction at
the wavelength of maximum absorbance in solutions of a given volume.
The relative amount of each pigment is given as a percentage of
the total. It should be noted that these values are only approxi-
