-7-
and 472mu in petroleum ether which is close to those recorded
for isozeaxanthin (Goodwin, 1954). Iodine catalyzed isomeri¬
zation was carried out according to the method of Zechmeister
(cf. Davies, 1965) Under these conditions isozeaxanthin formed
a series of five isomers while excess lipid interfered with the
results obtained with a similar treatment of the sample solution.
The identification of isozeaxanthin, therefore, must remain con-
jecture at this time since lackof material prevented further
investigation.
Fraction 3, Astaxanthin ester. This fraction elutes with isozeaxan-
thin from alumina with 30% acetone in petroleum ether as a purple
band. It is separable from isozeaxanthin, however, on columns of
Ngo-celite by elution with 100% acetone. The ester reveals a
single absorption maximum at Lóõmü in petroleum ether. The fraction
is 65% hypophasic before saponification and completely hypophasic
afterwards. The saponified pigment is inseparable from astaxanthin
(Re-O.18) in a solvent mixture of 30% acetone in petroleum ether
when co-chromatographed.
Fraction 1-Lutein. This pigment together with Fraction 5 eluted
slowly from alumina with 70% acetone-petroleum ether as a bright
yellow band. However, it was separable from Fraction 5 on Mgo¬
celite and could be eluted from the latter with 153 acetone in
petroleum ether. This fraction was hypophasic to 90% and 958
methanol both before and after saponification. The absorption
maxima in petroleum ether were ll5mu and 173mu. When co-chro-
matographed with a known sample of lutein in 25% acetone-pet-
roleum ether as a solvent mixture, the fractions were inseperable
(Rg-O.16)
