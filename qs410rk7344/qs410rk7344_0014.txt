Fluid
The characteristics of the stalk fluid and its contained
protein-complex in particular are extremely unusual. When freshly
collected the fluid is a dark orange with absorption character-
istics similar to those expected for the unbound carotenoid, but
upon standing overnight it turns yellow with a concomitant loss
of absorption in much of the visible range (Fig 2). The same
carotenoids present in the body are also found here except that
the astaxanthin is bound in some way to what appears to be a lipo-
protein. Although all six carotenoids were precipitated from the
fluid by the addition of ammonium sulfate only astaxanthin was
eluted from a DEAE-cellulose column suggesting that it alone is
truly bound to protein.
Numerous theories concerning the possible roles of caroteno-
protein in invertebrates have been suggested (Cheesman, et al, 1966).
Among these are, stabilization of the protein configuration, pro-
tective coloration against solar radiation, and protective color-
ation as a method of concealment. Protein stabilization seems
unlikely in polymerus because the fluid appears to be highly un-
stable. Since the fluid is completely bounded by a thick black
epidermis, it could not possibly provide protection either against
solar radiation or predation.
Lipo-protein complexes which have been noted in the blood of
many invertebrates may be involved in the transport of carotenoids.
since linkage to a protein makes fat soluble carotenoids water soluble
(Cheesman, et al 1966). A carotenoid attached to a lipo-protein
