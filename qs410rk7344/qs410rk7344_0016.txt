of a blue carotonoprotein in the eggs of the copepod Idya furcata
and the resulting transfer of the freed carotenoid to the nauplier
eye. Green (1965) also observed a similar process in Cladocera
where the carotenoprotein becomes restricted to the embryonic fat
cells as soon as they are formed, and once the link with the proÂ¬
tein is broken the free carotenoid passes into fat droplets.
Green speculates that this linkage of protein and carotenoid and
its consequent stabilizing effect removes the protein from the
possibility of attack by certain enzymes. Furthermore, he suggests
that the breakdown of a carotenoprotein may coincide with the peak
of proteinase activity.
Ball (1941) found that the blue astaxanthin protein complex
in Lepas broke at a definite point in the development of the
nauplii. A similar series of events apparently occurs in Pollicipes.
The percentage of lipo-protein bound astaxanthin likewise appears
to decline sharply with advancing development, although not all
of the complex is broken when the late stages are reached. The
protein complex in polymerus is, furthermore, so unstable that to
postulate any stabilization of the protein configuration due to
the presence of astaxanthin seems highly improbable. Rather, the
enhancement of the movement of water soluble molecules across
lipid-bound membranes, the transport of fat soluble carotenoids
in an aqueous medium or the stabilization of lipid membrane seem
to be the most probable functions of this carotenoid lipo-protein
complex.
P. polymerus, thus, parallels other invertebrates by the abun-
dance of astaxanthin found throughout its body. This astaxanthin,
moreover, appears to be taken directly from plant food sources
