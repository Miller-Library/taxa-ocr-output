Protein Complex
Protein complexes were extracted from the body, stalk fluid.
and ovigerous lamellae with O.2M phosphate buffer pH7 (KH.PO. 4
NaghPo). The extracted protein complex was then precipitated
with saturated ammonium sulfate, centrifuged, redissolved in dis-
illed water, and placed on columns of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman
DE 50). The proteins were then eluted by stepwise increase in
the ionic concentration of the perfusing buffer. The DEAE-cellulose
was prepared by first washing with normal NaoH, then distilled
water, normal Hol and finally again with distilled water. Columns
were prepared by packing a slurry of the purified exchange medium
in distilled water. The columns measured approximately 1.5 x 20 cm
and were thoroughly washed with 0.2M phosphate buffer, pH/, followed
by distilled water before the protein solutions were added.
Lipid Identification
Tentative identification of the class of lipids present in
the stalk fluid was carried out according to the method of Bloor
(cf. Mangold, 1962). 10 parts of stalk fluid was extracted with 20
parts of ethanol-diethyl ether (3 to 1) for 24 hours, concentrated
under nitrogen and plated on thin layer plates of Silica Gel G
(E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Deutschland) spread to a depth of 200u.
The plates were developed with a mixture of petroleum ether, diethyl
ether, acetic acid (90:10:1 v/v). The lipids were detected with
a 0.05% solution of Rhodamine B in 96% ethanol under U.V. light as
dark violet spots on a pink background.
