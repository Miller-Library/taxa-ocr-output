MATERTALS AND METHODS
Animals
Barnacles were collected both at The Hopkins Marine Station.
Pacific Grove, California and approximately one quarter mile south
of the mouth of Malpaso Creek near Yankee Point along California
Highway Wl. They were either brought back to the laboratory and
stored in a deep freezer at -7°0 until needed or the ovigerous la¬
mellae were dissected in the field and frozen as soon as'possible.
The stalk fluid was collected by cutting whole clumps of barnacles
from the rocks and allowing the stalks to drain. The material
was then centrifuged before being used.
xtraction of Carotenoids
The carotenoids were extracted from the bodies, ovigerous
lamellae, and stalk fluid with acetone. Petroleum ether (b.p.
20-10°0) was added and the carotenoids transferred to the petroleum
ether phase by the addition of water. The petroleum ether solu-
tion was repeatedly washed with water until free of acetone, dried
with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under a stream of
nitrogen.
The carotenoids were initially seperated chromatographically
on collunns of aluminum oxide (Woelm neutral - activity grade 1
for chromatography, Eschwege, Deutschland). The aluminum ogide
was activated by exposure to 11000 for one hour in an oven prior
to packing the columns. The columns, which were of two sizes.
measured approrimately l om x 15 cm and 1.5 om x 17 cm, respectively.
Figments were placed on the columns in petroleum ether and developed
with acetone-petroleum ether mixtures of different proportions.
The resulting bands were eluted and transfered again to petroleum
ether. Further purification was carried out on columms containing
75
