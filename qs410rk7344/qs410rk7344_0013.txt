This study has shown the presence of six carotenoids in the
bodies of mature P. polymerus. Astaxanthin and a single astaxan-
thin ester represent about 55% of the total carotenoid component
of this species. The only other pigment in substantial quantity
is lutein which represents about 31% of the total. This is in
general agreement with other studies of crustacean pigments in
which astaxanthin and lutein have both been found to be character-
istic, the former often amounting to well over one-half the total.
For example, in a recent study of the decapod Carcinus maenas
Gilchrist and Lee (1967) found that in the epidermis astaxanthin
accounted for 56% and lutein represented 212 of the total carotenoid
present.
It is interesting to compare the results of this study to those
obtained by Fox and Crozier (1967) from their work on the body
pigmentation of another stalked barnacle, L. fascicularis. They
found that carotenes accounted for 24.18 of the total carotenoid
while the remaining 75% was astaxanthin. This astaxanthin was,
however, in the form of a blue carotenoprotein whereas no carotenoid
is protein bound in the bodies of Pollicipes.
When the immature bodies of Pollicipes were extracted, no dif-
ference in the kind or relative abundance of carotenoids was found.
This data suggests that Pollicipes does not metabolize its large
amount of astaxanthin from carotene precursors since the presence
of possible intermediates was never established as it has been in
the case of other crustacea (cf. Lee 1966a; Gilchrist & Lee 1967).
Perhaps, though, metabolism in Pollicipes could take place very
