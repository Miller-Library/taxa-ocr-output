ovarian tissue suggesting the presence of a carotenoprotein which
might be involved in the devolopment of the nauplii, perhaps in a
manner similar to that described above. The ovigerous lamellae,
moreover, were observed to change color during development from a
bright orange, similar to that of the stalk fluid, to yellow
and then brown, further suggesting such a relationship.
The present study is an an invetigation of the carotenoids and
carotenoproteins present in both adult and immature barnacles.
their stalk fluid, and various stages of the ovigerous lamellae.
