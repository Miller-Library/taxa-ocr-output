into the tanks. Each row represents the behavior of an individual
animal during the thirty minute observational period.
2. Observed behaviors of Melibe during a thirty minute period
after macrocystis or plastic was introduced into the stimulus
compartment of the tanks. Each row represents the behavior of
an individual animal during the observational period. In response
to kelp all animals performed at least one of the locomotive
behaviors (i.e. walking, treading, and swimming)
3. Observed behavior of rhinophorectomized Melibe in response to
plastic, macrocystis, or mysid. Each row represents the behavior
of an individual animal during the observational period.
4 Observed behaviors of Melibe in response to mysid or brine
shrimp. Each row represents the behavior of an individual animal
