DISCUSSION
The major finding of this study is that Melibe leonina perform
specific behaviors as a result of olfactory information detected
by the rhinophore organ. The data indicate that Melibe alter their
behavior based on chemical cues from their environment.
Introduction of macrocystis in the stimulus compartment causes
a transition from a resting state into a motile state.
Introduction of mysid causes a transition from a resting state
into a feeding state. The indication that the cue is olfactory, as
opposed to visual or tactile, is that the behavioral transition is
not accomplished with plastic macrocystis shapes or with brine
shrimp alone. (Figures 4 and 5) However, macrocystis and brine
shrimp presented together are sufficient to evoke feeding
behavior. These data indicate that the Melibe world is olfactory
as well as tactile.
Macrocystis evokes locomotion indicating that chemical stimuli
appears to trigger behavior that is useful in the natural
environment of the Melibe. Macrocystis is the location of a
number of important behaviors: egg laying, food finding, and
location of conspecifics. Macrocystis has a characteristic
secretion, providing Melibe with an olfactory stimulus
underwater. Although Melibe are sensitive to changes in light and
in water flow, experiments with simulated macrocystis indicate
that the chemical attributes of the macrocystis, not other
factors, trigger an increase in activity. This ability is important
because it increases the probability that the Melibe relocates the
