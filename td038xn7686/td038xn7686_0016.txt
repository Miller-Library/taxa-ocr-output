1. Dorsal view of Melibe leonina.
2. Sketch of chemical detection tanks.
3. Tank set-up for brine shrimp experiment. Animals observed for
thirty minutes after introduction of the stimulant.
a. brine shrimp in stimulus compartment evokes no response
from melibe
b. brine shrimp in Melibe compartment evokes no reponse
from melibe
c. kelp in stimulus compartment and brine shrimp in Melibe
compartment evokes a feeding response.
4. Comparison of the percentage of Melibe tested performing
specific behaviors in response to smell of kelp and control kelp
within 30-minute period. The behavioral totals may exceed 100%
because individual Melibe may perform more than one behavior
during the observation period. At least 50% of the animals
performed each behavior in response to kelp. In response to the
control, only 328 of the animals were responsive and only one
behavior was performed.
5. Comparison of the percentage of Melibe tested performing
specific behaviors in response to smell of mysid and brine shrimp
within a 30-minute period. All tested animals opened their hoods
in response to mysid, and many animals exhibited other behaviors
as well. In contrast, none of the Melibe opened their hoods in
response to brine shrimp smell and only 25% of tested animals
came out of the resting state.
6. Comparison of rhinophorectomized Melibe exposed to
chemoeffective stimuli and normal Melibe exposed to control
stimuli during a thirty minute period. Rhinophorectomized
animals exposed to chemoeffective stimuli display similar levels
of behavior to normal animals exposed to control stimuli.
