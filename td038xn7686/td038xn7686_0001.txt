ABSTRACT
Chemical cues from macrocystis and mysid are capable of
triggering behaviors in the nudibranch mollusc, Melibe leonina
The behaviors ellicited are appropriate to the stimulus. (Le.
Melibe locomote in response to macrocystis, and exhibit feeding
behavior in response to mysid.) These behaviors are not seen
when the animals are in an isolated environment or are
stimulated solely by touch or vision. Furthermore, Melibe exhibit
the ability to integrate chemical cues. while neither brine shrimp
nor kelp alone will inspire them to feed, brine shrimp combined
with the smell of kelp provides the threshold stimulus necessary
to begin feeding. Rhinophore ablation indicates that the
rhinophores are the chemoreceptive organs responsible for the
detection of these cues.
