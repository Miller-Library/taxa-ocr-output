INTRODUCTION
Chemoethology is the effect of chemical stimuli on behayjor. The
two principal forms of chemoreception are olfaction and
gustation. There are numerous ways of differentiating between
the two: necessary concentrations for detection, solubility.
volatility, organs for detection, and distance. In this paper.
distance is the criterion used to distinguish between the two.
Smell is distance chemoreception, while taste is touch
chemoreception.
Underwater, olfaction is one of the most useful senses. Highly
volatile compounds such as amino acids, which on land can only be
tasted, are water soluble. This allows them to impart important
chemical messages in the water. Chemical stimuli are especjally
useful because they occur in large quantities, can be detected in
either light or dark, and can impart highly specific messages,
despite needing simple receptors. (For review see Croll, 1983
and Ache, 1987) Chemoreception has been shown to play a role in
initiating many behaviors in molluscs. Chemoreception has been
shown to be important in homing (Gelperin, 1973), feeding (Frings
and Frings, 1965), and localization of conspecifics (Audesirk and
Audesirk, 1977).
Much of the research done with chemoreception has used amino
acids as stimuli. (Agersbourg, 1922; Bicker et al, 1982; JahanÂ¬
Parwar, 1972) However, for the purpose of this experiment,
used stimuli that are found in the natural environment of the
