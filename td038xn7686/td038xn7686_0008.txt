performed one of the locomotive behaviors: walking, treading, or
swimming.
When the simulated macrocystis was used as the stimulus the
only behavior observed was scanning. This behavior was seen in
six of nineteen animals tested. The remaining animals stayed in
the resting state. (Table 2)
Ã„fter rhinophore ablation, fewer animals came out of the resting
state in response to macrocystis stimulus. (Table 3) Both the
scanning and open hood behaviors were observed (2710), (1710).
There was no appreciable difference between the behavior of the
normal animals and those which had a small piece of rbp removed.
Response to Mysids
When normal Melibe were exposed to mysid thirteen of thirteen
animals came out of the resting state. The oberved behaviors
were scanning (12/13), walking (4/13), treading (2/13), amd
swimming (1/13). (Table 4)
The only behavior observed when normal Melibe were exposed to
the smell of brine shrimp was scanning (3/13). (Table 4)
Furthermore, when Melibe were exposed directly to brine shrimp,
only two of the thirteen began to feed. However, under these
conditions, introduction of macrocystis into the stimulus
compartment of the tank initiated feeding in all but one of the
animals. (Figure 3)
