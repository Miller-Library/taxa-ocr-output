MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Maintenance
Melibe leonina were collected from the kelp forest near Del Monte
Beach in Monterey, California at depths between 10 and 35 feet.
The Melibe were contained in tanks with an open flowing sea
water system at 100-15°C. Macrocystis and a variety of snails
were added to provide the Melibe with a natural and clean
environment. Melibe were fed either mysids collected by dip net
in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge or commercially grown brine
shrimp every other day.
Chemical detection
Melibe were placed in specially designed tanks to test
chemoreceptive ability. (Figure 2) The tanks were 15-liter
Plexiglass“ tanks. Plexiglass"" dividers were caulked in the
center to divide the tanks into two compartments. Two holes of
6.3cm in diameter were drilled in the dividers, and Nytex screen
was caulked over the holes to allow passage of water and
chemical stimuli through the tank. Seawater between 110 and
15°C flowed freely into the compartment in which the stimulus
was contained. Melibe were placed in the other compartment and
were allowed to acclimate for at least six hours before a
stimulus was added. The water drained from the tank through a
standpipe in the same compartment as the Melibe. Only one
animal was placed in each tank for each trial, and the tanks were
washed with fresh water between trials.
