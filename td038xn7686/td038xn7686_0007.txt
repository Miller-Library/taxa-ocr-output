RESULTS
The behaviors that were observed during Melibe observation are
defined as follows:
resting foot and hood resting on the substratum tentacles folded
into the hood. Tentacles may or may not be visible.
scanning: continuous head motion while body remains still.
walking locomotion along the substratum.
treading back and forth movement of the body while the foot is
still attached to the substratum
swimming: complete removal of foot from the substratum with
consequent locomotion through water.
open hood an extension of the hood beyond the point where
tentacles are extended.
The baseline behavioral data obtained, when the Melibe were
observed for thirty minutes with no stimuli indicates a low level
of activity. The only behavior that occurred was scanning. Three
of the ten Melibe tested performed this behavior. The remaining
seven Melibe remained in the resting position for the entire test
period. (Table 1)
Response to Macrocystis
When normal Melibe were exposed to macrocystis, all 13 animals
tested came out of the resting state. Behaviors included scanning
(11/13), walking (12/13), treading (11/13), swimming (7/13),
and hood opening 7713. (Table 2) All the animals tested
