Baseline behavioral observations were taken with no stimuli to
determine the behavior of the Melibe in a sterile environment.
Macrocystis and mysids, the stimuli used, were chosen because
they serve as the preferred location and food source,
respectively. To study the chemoeffective properties of
macrocystis, two fronds of macrocystis, each with a length of
55-65cm, were added to the stimulus compartment of the tank.
For the mysid trials, approximately thirty mysids were added to
the stimulus compartment. The animals were then observed for a
30 minute period. To control for variations in water flow and
light due to the presence of the stimuli, trials were conducted in
the same manner using macrocystis shapes made from, black
plastic to control for the presence of macrocystis or brine shrimp
to control for the presence of mysids.
Anatomy
The pouch containing the rhinophore was excised from a conscjous
animal using irridectomy scissors. The animals were then tagged
by injecting them with 1cc of either methyl blue or fast green
dye. In controls a comparably sized piece of tissue was removed
in the same manner from the area adjacent to the rhinophore on
control animals. To guard against infection, all surgically altered
animals were individually isolated for twenty-four hours in tanks
which for ten minutes every two hours received an inflow of UV
and heat sterilized seawater filtered to 5u. Trials were
conducted in the same manner as for the normal animals. Stimuli
studied were macrocystis, control macrocystis, and mysids.
