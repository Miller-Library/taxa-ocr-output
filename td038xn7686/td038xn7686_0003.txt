Melibe. This allowed for the targeting of behaviors which are
triggered by natural stimuli. Although amino acids are the most
probable source of smell, the ability of an animal to detect both
the unique combination of amino acids and concentrations of
amino acids in a specific stimulus provides more insight into the
role of smell in the natural environment than would experiments
employing isolated and or increased concentrations of amino
acids. Behavioral studies were performed to determine which
stimuli to study and to determine which behaviors can beÂ¬
triggered by chemoreception.
The rhinophore is the principal organ which has been indicated in
chemoreception in numerous nudibranchs. In Melibe leonina, a
rhinophore of between Amm and 6mm in length is located within a
small pocket of tissue on the tip of each of the rhinophore bearing
processes (rbp). (Figure 1) The rhinophore is highly convoluted;
therefore, it has a large surface area. This allows for an
increased area with which it can contact different water borne
molecules. In an active animal the rhinophore is exposed;
howeyer, when an animal is stressed it retracts the rhinophore
into the pocket. The rhinophore is innervated by a nerve (C4)
which leads to the tentacular lobe of the central ganglion. (Hurst,
1968). Unlike the other three cerebral nerves which innervate the
oral hood, C4 has no interconnections with other cerebral nerves.
This implies that information from the rhinophore is carried
directly to the brain without integrating information from other
systems. This paper seeks to define specific behaviors which are
