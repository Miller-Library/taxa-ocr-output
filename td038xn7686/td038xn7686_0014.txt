ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 would like to thank my advisor, Stuart Thompson, for his help and
enthusiasm. I would also like to thank Mary Lucero for sharing her
vast knowledge (and reprints) on olfaction. I am grateful to Karla
Palmeri for the use of the tanks, space, and for answering all my
questions about animal care, Chris Patton for his help with
photography, and John Lee for all his mechanical help and an endless
supply of caulk. Chris Mathes deserves thanks for a great deal of
encouragement and for forcing my to put things in perspective. Thanks
to Sam Wang for always taking the time to discuss science, (Sam..., do
you have a minute?") and for vast amounts of constructive criticism.
Thanks to everyone at Hopkins for being helpful and friendly. I'd like
to express my gratitude to the spring class, especially to Agnieszka
Rawa for always asking questions, William Nathaniel Timmins for
providing cookies and the answer to the ultimate question about
gustation of Melibe, and Amanda Schivell for her boundless enthusiasm
and open ears during the Melibe and mysid hunts.
