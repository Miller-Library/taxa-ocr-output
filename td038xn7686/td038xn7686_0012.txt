stimulation of the tentacles initiates the feeding behavior.
Although the mechanism for this phenomena is not understood at
present, this experiment does indicate that Melibe are capable of
integrating chemical cues.
The rhinophore ablation experiments indicate that the rhinophores
are the principal chemosensory organs for the passage of
afferent information regarding the smell of macrocystis and
mysid. There is a negligible difference in the responses of the
rhinophorectomized animals exposed to chemoeffective stimuli,
those exposed to control stimuli, and normal animals exposed to
control stimuli. (Figure 6) This contrasts with the
Pleurobranchaea californica in which it has been shown that the
rhinophores, tentacles and oral veil are all receptive to the same
chemical stimuli. (Bicker et al, 1982) while there is no indication
of a lack of sensitivity of other organs of the Melibe to
macrocystis and mysid, the removal of the rhinophores yields a
decrease in behavioral responses to the comparable levels of an
unstimulated control animal. This indicates that the rhinophore
may be the sole organ responsible for the detection of these
stimuli.
Rhinophores may potentially detect many other stimuli besides
mysids and macrocystis. Furthermore, they may be sensitive to
variations in quantities of these stimuli. The independence of C4
may be indicative of the complexity of the rhinophore. he
