macrocystis if it is detached. However, when Melibe are attached
to macrocystis, they move infrequently. A possible explanation
for this is that there is a tactile inhibition by macrocystis which
overides the olfactory input. Another explanation is that the
animals habituate to the smell of the macrocystis.
Mysids also evoke heightened activity in the Melibe. In contrast
to macrocystis, this chemical stimulus triggers hood opening.
This serves two purposes. It allows for an increased surface area
for tactile stimulation. Furthermore, once they receive the
tactile stimulus, all the melibe must do is close their mouths
around their prey. The nature of the behavior makes the chemical
trigger essential. Because of water currents, a tactile stimulus
is probably less useful under water. More importantly, Melibe
move relatively slowly. If they were to wait for a tactile
stimulus to begin feeding, their prey would escape before they
could catch it.
The experiments with brine shrimp indicate that changes in water
flow alone can not account for the hood opening behavior in
response to mysid. Furthermore, the experiments allowing
tactile stimulation by brine shrimp indicate that tactile
stimulation to a resting animal is not enough to trigger feeding in
a sterile environment. However, when macrocystis smell is
introduced into the system, feeding behavior is initiated. One
explanation of the integration of these two stimuli to yield
feeding is that the concomitant relaxation of the hood to allow
