tests belonging to these latter groups were to be obtained
in larger numbers, a more confident and knowledgable
analysis of possible trends could be completed.
The cyprid larvae of Balanus balanoides have been shown
to be able to detect and respond to different
characteristics of the surface on which they are exploring
as a possible permanent home site (Yule and Crisp, 1983).
In the conteat of these studies, the results shown in Figure
4 suggest that at some time in the life cycle, B. glandula
is able to determine the strength of the rock on which it
sits. If it realizes that it resides on a rocky substratum
whose surtace strength is low, it apparently diverts energy
away from producing a stronger cement, attachment fibers or
shell. This raises the possibility that the barnacles on
weak substrata invest energy into the more rapid growth oÂ¬
the reproductive system. This speculation assumes that the
populations present at the three locations studied are
genetically similar. If they are not, then this scenario
may turn put to be simply an example of differences between
populations. Unfortunately, not enough is known about the
genetic diversity of B. glandula on the coast of California
to determine whether this study deals with one or more
populations, although this field of research is an active
one (personal communication, Lani West). Therefore, any
conclusion concerning the results contained in Figure 4 will
have to wait until more conclusive studies have been
conducted on the species' genetic diversity.
