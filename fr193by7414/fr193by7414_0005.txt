examined to determine what part of it had brokem, and the
force required for removal was noted.
Simple linear regressions were run on the tests in
order to determine if a relationship existed between the
basal area of the barnacle and the force needed to dislodge
the specimen. These were performed for each group in the
study, a group being defined by the rock type the barnacle
was attached t and the location of the break.
RESULTS
123 tests were performed. For 35 of these, the paper
clips were pulled out, while the rack and the barnacle
remained attached; these tests will not be considered
further. In only pne case was breaking force correlated
wtih area: that for the first type of granite when the
barnacle broke. The relationship was as follows: Force
required to break barnacle (Newtons)- 272424.Ã  Fa X Basal
area (m) + 2.87 M (r -.4401, 29 D.F.).
For the forty-two tests where the barnacle broke, the
mean breaking stress values differed significantly among
rock types, with the exception of those barnacles on the
sandstone and shale (see Figure 4 and Table 1).
Twenty-one of the 12 tests broke the rock before the
barnacle or paper clip dislodged. The granite broke just
once (this was the first type of granite), while the
sandstone and shale broke a total of twenty times. The mean
