Ihe mean sur face strength of the sandstone found at
Stillwater Cove is roughly one-third of that of the north
Santa Cruz shale and this shale value is approximately half
that of the minimum strength for the weaker of the two types
of granite (see Tables I and 2). Although the values for
the sandstone and shale are not significantly different, the
wide mange encompassing all the rock surface strengths
demonstrates that the argument in the previous paragraph is
plausible, as they are direct evidence for the existence of
substrata with differing surface strengths.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
First and for most, I would like to thank Mark Denny for the
time he spent helping me perform and think about my study.
I would also like to thank Doug Stomer for assistance with
statistics and Lani West for the information concerning the
population genetics of B.glandula. Judy Thompson was
helpful in a wide variety of ways; additionally, the rest of
the staff here at Hopkins have heen both friendly and
helpful. Thanks to Allen and the library staff for
minimizing my wandering time before actually finding what I
wanted. Finally, thanks to my fellow 175H students for
providing thought-provoking comments and simply for their
friendship.
