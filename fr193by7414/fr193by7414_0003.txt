cohesive tailure occurs. Yet even knowing the breaking
stress value (another term for strength) for the cement, one
still does not know how biplogically relevant this value is.
Although the cement may be able to withstand stresses of um
to 170,000 Fa, other components, such as the substratum to
which the barnacle is attached, the shell plates, or the
fixation fibres may not. The present study was designed to
see what part of the entire barnacle-rocky substratum
complex would fail first, and at what stress level. The
experiments were carried out on four different rock types to
test for any effect of the substratum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
B. plandula were studied at three locations near
Monterey, California comprising four different rocky
substrata: (1) The north side of Whale Feak at Garrapata
State Fark, located about S miles south of Carmel, with two
types of granite, (2) Stillwater Cove, in Carmel Bay next to
the Febble Beach golf course, with a type of sandstone, (I)
Natural Bridges State Fark in north Santa Cruz, CO, with
Monterey shale.
For each test, a straightened paper clip was used to
remove the barnacle's body from the shell and a "O-Tip" was
then used to absorb as much of the remaining fluid as
possible. Ofter the inside of the barnacle was allowed to
dry for a few minutes, "Five Minute" epoky was applied to
