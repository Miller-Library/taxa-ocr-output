INTFODUCTION
The larvae of Beglandula must undergo two
metamorphoses before becoming a sessile adult. The barnacle
during these two stages is pelagic and free-swimming, but
the second stage larvae, referred to as the cyprid, must
settle permanently before the second metamorphosis occurs.
Ihis settlement takes place on a wide variety of substances.
whose physical properties, such as surface strengt, can vary
greatly. Strength is the amount of force per area that must
be applied to cause the pieces uf the material to break.
he barnacle has three types of body plates: basal,
shell, and opercular. The basal plate, which forms the
base of the barnacle's truncated cone-like shape, cannt be
cemented to the shell plates, which comprise the side walls,
if the barnacle is to expand its diameter during growth.
Consequently, 'fixation fibres' hold these two plate types
tagether. Cement is exuded beneath the calcareous basal
plate to anchor the barnacle to the substratum. Os
barnacles cam enjoy a fairly lang lifetime, ane would expect
that they would attempt to maximise the strength of this
anchoring system.
The cement af the adult balanoid barnacles has beem
studied with regard to its strength of adhesion to slate,
steel, and rubber surfaces (Carderelli,18; Yule ?
Walker,1784) and the work of Yule and Walker (1984) provides
a stress value of 1.7 X 10 Fa for barnacle cement before
