Measurements were made of the force required to break
the barnacle Halanus glandula while the animal was attached
to tour different rocky substrata. Force was exerted on the
barnacle normal to the substrate surface and the
dislodgement force was recorded. In general, force was not
proportional to barnacle size and barnacles were stronger om
stronger rocks. The results are discussed in the context of
the environmental hydrodynamic forces encountered and the
population genetics of B. glandula.
