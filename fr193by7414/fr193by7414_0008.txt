contributing to the lack of a relationship between force and
area noted here. Twenty-five tests resulted in breaking
both the barnacle and the rock on which it sat. Here also
the variability in location of break probably contributed to
the negative finding.
Ihe lack of a force versus area relationship for the
twenty-ane tests where the rocky substratum broke beneath
the barnacle is not too surprising, considering the highly
variable treatment rocks are subjected to in the intertidal
rone. A variety of organisms affect the surface
characteristics of the sutstratum either by physical
actions, such as burrowing, or chemical means, such as
secreting mucus on the rock which contains a wide variety of
chemical compounds. These compounds may alter the integrity
of the bonds within the rock which comprise its strength.
Fhysical forces from the sun and the waves also affect
different portions of the rock to varying degrees. Since
these factors weaken the rock's breaking strees in different
amounts and their location of attack is more-or-less random,
one must expect to find a variety of values for the rock's
breaking stress when testing at different sites on the rock.
Only a small number of tests were performed for many of
the groups, which defined by break location and the rock
type on which the barnacle sat. As mentioned above, some of
these group sizes would most likely not increase, no matter
how many tests were conducted. For other groups though,
additional tests would prove relatively easy to obtain. If
