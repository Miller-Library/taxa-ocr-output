surtace breaking stress for the Monterey shale found in
Santa Cruz was approximately three times greater (161,338.89
Pa) than that for the Stillwater Cove sandstone (49,350.00
Pa). Ihe one case of the granite breaking was for a
feldspar crystal in the quartz and mica matrix and required
295,000 Pa to dislodge it. Otherwise, all that can be said
for the two types of granite is that at least JO2,077.42 Pa
for the first type and 523,500 Fa for the second must be
applied before they break. These values come from the mean
breaking stresses of the barnacles on the granite substrata,
since granite did not break before the barnacles did.
Additionally, twenty-five tests broke some combination of
barnacle and sandstone or shale (see Tables T and 3). For
both groups, analysis of variance demonstrated mo
significant differences between mean breaking stress values.
DISCUSSION
As larger barnacles receive larger wave forces tham
smaller ones due to a greater exposed area, one would expect
that they would have to be attached with a greater temacity
in order to survive. Unexpectedly though, the results
obtained here do nat support this line of reasoming. Only
barnacles attached toone of the four types ofrock
demonstrated a significant relationship between force and
area.
When a B. glandula suffered a break, the basal plate
usually remained fixed to the substratum, while the shell
