barnacle cement layer is exaggerated in size for purposes of
clarity.
Figure 2: Diagram of the top view of the barnacle's basal
area, illustrating the measurement conventions used in this
study.
Figure 3: Diagram of the apparatus used to measure the
breaking stress value.
Figure 4: Graph of rock type versus the mean strength of E.
glandula. The middle symbol of the three points for each
rock type is the mean value, while the upper and lower
points represent the range of the 957 confidence interyals.
Analysis of variance and the GTT method were used to obtain
the values shown.
