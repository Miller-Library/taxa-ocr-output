Figure One
Pictures of the oscilloscope image of the compound action potential of a
as sciatic nerve, showing the gradual decrease in the potential of the
Rans
pipi
portion of the nerve affected by Epitonium toxin. Pictures were taken at O min.,
30 min., and 45 min.
Figure Two
a) Effect of the pallial area of Epitonium alone in decreasing the action
potential of a Rana pipiens sciatic nerve. Ratio of second peak/ first peak
decreases from 4.7/4.4-1,07 to 1.8/4,2=.43. Pictures were taken at 0 min, and
at 30 min.
b) Lack of asymmetric decrease in action potential to Epitonium extract not
including the pallial area. Ratio of second peak/ first peak changes from
2.4/3.9= .61 to 2.8/4.6= .608. Pictures taken at 0 min. and at 30 min.
Figure Three
a). Polygraph readout showing an ideal contraction to injection of tryp-
tamine followed by responsive contractions to touch and further injections of
tryptamine and of water.
b). Spontaneous contractions under the effect of tryptamine.
Figure Four
At a) Epitonium extract was injected into the system; this section of the
polygraph covers 30 min.; during the first 18 both the endogenous rhythm and
response to stimulation have been extinguished, the spontaneous rhythm returns
after the 18 min.
