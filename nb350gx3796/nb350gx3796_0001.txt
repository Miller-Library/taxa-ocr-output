Epitonium toxin p. 1
NTRODUCTION
Epitonium tinctum (Carpenter, 1864) and Epitonium indianorum (Carpenter, 1864)
are two small marine mesogastropods often associated with sea anemones. Thorson
(1957, p. 57) reported commonly finding E. tinctum at the base of the anemone Antho¬
Pleura xanthe
rammica (Brandt, 1835); Hochberg (1971, p. 23) described E. tinctum
feeding on the tentacles of Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835). I have made
further observations which suggest that E. tinctum and E. indianorum feed selectively
on the tentacles and sometines the verrucae of the particular anemone species
with which they are associated.
An experiment involving a choice between moving toward or away from an anemone
implies that Epitonium tinctum and E. indianorum use a chemosensory method to lo-
cate anemones, and can differentiate between anemone species with the method.
Epitonium species produce a purple dye from the hypobranchial gland area;
Lönnberg (1932, p. 10) extracted the dye from Scalaria clathrus (Linnaeus) and
found it to have an absorbtion spectrum consistent with a carotenoid. Perhaps part-
ly due to speculation by P. David (c.f. Wilson and Wilson, 1956, p. 292) that the
purple dye of lanthina janthina (Linnaeus) anesthetizes the Velella velella (Linn-
aeus) on which it feeds, Robertson, (1963, p. 51) suggests that the dye produced
by Epitonium species may be an anesthetic. I have found that both Epitonium tinctum
and E. indianorum produce a substance in the pallial area which inhibits the com¬
pound action potential of nerve axons and affects the spontaneous rhythm and con¬
traction to a stimulis of an anemone tentacle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Epitonium tinctum were collected intertidally at Mussel Point, Monterey Bay
California; predominantly on the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, and less fre-
quently on Anthopleura xanthogrammica. Epitonium indianorum were collected from
