Graph One
On the left, the percentages from ten trials for Epitonium tinctum (the
upper bar in each section) and Epitonium indianorum (the lower bar) moving more
than .5 cm. up a Y tube toward a tank containing an anemone is shown for five anem¬
one species. In the control, the number shown is the larger percentage of those
moving up either branch.
On the right, the percintages are then corrected by subtracting the control
value to give an increase or decrease in affinity; the tendancy to move toward
the anemone.
Graph two
Using the same correction procedure as above, the graph illustrates, —lvve

by moving up the other branch of the Y tube, and (below) the percent avoiding the
anemone by moving down the Y tube.
