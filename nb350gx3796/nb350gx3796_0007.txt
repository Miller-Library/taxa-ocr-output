DISCUSSION
This paper has reported evidence that an extract from the pallial region
of Epitonium is toxic to the nerve of Rana pipiess, less concrete evidence that
Epitonium inhibits tentacle contraction. A toxin or anesthetic produced by Epi
tonium could be useful in two ways ; it could be used to desensitize the column
of the anemone over which the Epitonium walks, or it could anesthetize the ten¬
tacle on which the Epitonium is feeding, in which case the Epitonium would need
a quick method of applying the toxin. Robertson (1963, p. 51) mentions that some
Epitonium possess hollow thorns which may be used to inject a toxin; I did not
find such thorns or a duct in the proboscis originating in the pallial area
which might be used to carry toxin. Thus, because of this, and because I have
seen dye (which is also produced in the pallåal area) on the foot of Epitonium,
would suggest that the toxin or anesthetic is used generally to desentize the
anemone on which the Epitonium rests,
SUMMAR
Epitonium tinctum and E. indianorum are two mesogastropods which feed pre-
dominantly on the tentacles of various anemones. Laboratory experiments show that
they may locate anemones using a chemosensory method. Both produce a purple dye,
which may be a carotenoid; and both produce a toxin or anesthetic which isweither
a large molecule or is attached to a large molecule. The toxin inhibits the com¬
pound action potential of the sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens and also the con¬
tractions of a tentacle from Tealia crassic
