Effects on Nerve Action Potential

The size of the compound action potential of the nerve was decreased by
the Epitonium toxin; in this case the ratio of the peak recorded at the site on
the nerve after the toxin well to the peak recorded before the well decreased from
4.2/3.3=1.27 to 1.1/3.9=.39. Thus there is some water soluble substance in
Epitonium which is capable of inhibiting the ability of the nerve to conduct an
impulse; perhaps by affecting ion transport across the nerve membrane. Note that
the positive after-potential of the nerve was abolished. The speed of conduction
of the impulse was slowed; the distance between the two peaks has increased. Some
of the nerve fibers were extinguished faster than others; the potentials of the
faster conducting nerves was extinguished and the peak broadened.
The toxin used in this experiment had been dialysed for twelve hours ågainst
a total of 2000 ml. Ringers solution. Epitonium toxin also inhibited the nerve
after being dialysed for twenty-four hours. Thus, it is either a large molecule,
such as a protein, or is altached to a large molecule.
Nu a
JThe action potential was inhibited by the presence of a solution from the
Epitonium pallial region, but was not affected by an extract from the rest of
the body. The toxin is either produced or stored in the pallial region, possibly
the hypobranchial gland.
Effect
on Contraction of Anemone fentacles
Lgvnd 347
For a period of 18 minutes following the injection of Epitonium extract into
a tentacle, both the inherent contractions and the contractions in respose to stin¬
ulus were abolished, even when the tentacle had been sensitized by tryptamine,
