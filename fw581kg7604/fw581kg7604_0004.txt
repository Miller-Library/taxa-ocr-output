discernible by eye.
As can be seen from Figure 1, 85% of the limpets which were
seen to forage homed back to their original home sites. This analysis
does not explain the fate of the 15% which changed home sites, and
actually underestimates homing. The 3 limpets changing sites in
Figure 1 did actually show homing behavior as indicated in Figure 2,
which analyzes homing according to the total number of forays made
during each high tide. Levels of homing are diagrammed in Figure 2a,
" 1° homing" is homing to the site wherethe limpet was originally
marked. "Site changing" is failing to return after foraging to a
site to which homing previously occurred. "2° homing" is homing to
the site where the limpet was found after failing to return to the
original site. "3° homing" is homing to the site where the limpet
was found after failing to return to the 2° site. Figure 2b shows
that 84.1% of forays resulted in 1° homing, and a total of 10.1%
resulted in 2° or 3° homing. No foray ending in site changing was
ever followed by another non-homing foray, i.e. there was always
at least one instance of homing to the new site.
Discussion
The results indicate that small individuals of C. scabra can
indeed home, although there is a tendency to change home sites. It
is possible that the proportion of 1° homers to home site changers
is greater than that suggested by this study, since some C. scabra
may have moved and homed once or more during the night high tides.
For instance, of all 6 non-movers had foraged at night, then the
maximum fraction of 1° homers would be 88.5%, rather than the 84.1%
