PART II: Studies on possible mechanisms of homing in the limpet
Collisella scabra.
Introduction
As mentioned in Part I, the exact mechanism of homing in the
limpet Collisella scabra is still unknown. JESSEE (1968), and COOK
et al. (1969) attempted to prevent homing behavior in C. scabra by
scrubbing the rock surface around the home site, and by applying
NaoH or HCl, to destroy any chemical trail that may have been laid
down by the foraging animal. Homing was reduced, but not eliminated.
JESSEE (1968) believes that this signifies some appreciation of the
rock topography by the limpet. COOK ( ?) suggests that a reason
for the lack of homing prevention could be inefficiency of methods
used in attempting to remove a chemical trail. The purpose of
this study was to investigate further the possible mechanisms of
homing in C. scabra.
Materials and methods
There were four stages of experiments. First, home site burning
was attempted in the field and in the lab. Second, limpets were taken
from the field and put on glass in the lab in order to see whether
they 1) conformed to their new substrate, and 2) set up home sites
on a flat surface totally devoid of topographical information. Third,
a similar test was done, using rocks as substrate instead of glass.
Finally, a series of home site transplantation experiments was done
in the lab, in which quartz home sites were chiselled off rocks and
transplanted, together with the resident limpet, to glass or new rock
substrates.
