it did not leave its crystal. It would seem that the last method
of home site transplantation would be most useful in additional
future studies of this sort.
Discussion
Based on the results of sea-table home site-burning experiments.
it appears that a complex, information-bearing chemical trail, if laid
down by these limpets at all, is not necessary for homing to occur.
It seems that some kind of recognition of local topography could
allow the limpet to return home. It is possible, however, that a
combination of trail following and topography appreciation is involved
in homing behavior, not necessarily at the same time, but in sequence.
as the animal develops. For example, very small, newly settled
C. scabra might initially lay chemical trails on the not-yet-familiar
substrate, in order to return to their home sites, "learning" the
topography as they become familiar with it in foraging. Once this
occurred, chemical information might no longer be necessary.
The admittedly casual observations on home site transplantation
and limpet displacement show that limpet homing can be studied in the
lab. The fact that C. scabra were not seen to home on glass could
be indicative of a need for some kind of variance in the surface of
the substrate to facilitate homing via "learning" of the topography;
or it may simply suggest that in cases where C. scabra conform to
the surface everywhere, they do not need to home to a specific site.
The limpets which were displaced were, unfortunately, not rigorously
observed throughout every high tide after being taken from the field.
so it is not known whether they consistently followed their outgoing
