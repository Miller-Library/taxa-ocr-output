to the crystal/granite interface is usually sufficient to dislodge
the whole crystal, complete with the limpet on its home site. A
number of crystal home sites were thus removed from the field and
transplanted to glass and new rocks in the sea-table. They were glued
to the new substrate with silicone sealant (Figure 4).
Once the limpets had crawled off the crystals onto the glass
substrate, they wandered with each high tide, never returning to
the region of their crystal home sites. Within 5 "high tides." 6 out
of 9 limpets had left the glass altogether, the remaining 3 never
having left their crystals through 20 days of observation. Varied
results were obtained from observations of limpets on crystals
transplanted to new rocks. After 2 weeks, 4 of 12 animals had never
left the crystals, 5 had left and set up new home sites on the rock,
never having moyed back in the direction of their crystals, 2 were
missing, and 2 limpets had left their crystals, foraged on the rock.
and returned via the outgoing path to their original home sites.
Homing on these transplanted sited was thus very poor. In an
attempt to reduce the possible adverse effect of steep cliffs (crystal
edges) on homing ability or desire to return home, similar transplant-
ation was performed, but this time the crystals were embedded in pits
chiselled into the new granite so that the edges were flush with the
surface of the rock. Gaps were filled in with a mixture of ground
granite and glue. 2 crystals were embedded in this manner. One
limpet never left its crystal in 10 days of observation. The other
left and foraged on the rock, homing back to its home site at the
onset of "low tide," on 3 separate occasions. The rest of the time,
