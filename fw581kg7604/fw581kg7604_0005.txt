reported. This is still less than the 97.8% homing reported by
BRANT (1950) over a 5 day sampling period for larger C. scabra on
low rocks. It would be interesting to study growth rates of small
C. scabra in relation to home site-changing frequency, to determine
whether a limpet retains its home site longer as it gets larger.
It may be adaptive for the young limpet to change sites every so
often, in the chance of finding the "perfect" home.
Other possible reasons for site changing include interference
from other organisms. In two cases, a larger, "intruding" C. scabra
wasffound on the home site of the small marked limpet which had settled
in a spot away from its home site. Even after the intruder had
moved away, 2-4 high tides later, the small limpet did not reclaim
its site. Home site changing could possibly be the result of environÂ¬
mental trauma, which might have smaller effect on the limpet as it
grows larger.
