Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. W. Gilly, for encouragement
and advice provided throughout this study, and also for the
inspirational trips to the Seaside Dump. The assistance of the
many unfortunate C. scabra who were forced to give up their homes in
the name of science is also gratefully acknowledged.
