in length (8), 2-3mm (7), and 3-4mm (11). The limpets were marked
with a dot of red nail polish on the apex of the shell, and a dot was
painted on the granite imm anterior to the shell. Relative positions
of the dot and the marked limpet were noted. A number or letter
corresponding to each animal was painted on the rock in the vicinity
of the "home" site.
During 5 consecutive daytime high tides the limpets were observed
every hour for 7 hours, and movements away from home were noted. In
preliminary observations, no limpet was seen to start and complete
a foraging run in under an hour, so it is assumed that all forays
made during each high tide were recorded. No observations were made
during high tides at night. If a limpet failed to return to the site
where it was originally marked, its new location was marked at low
tide.
Results
Of 26 C. scabra, 6 were never seen to forage (Figure 1). These
may have moved during one or more night high tides, or they may not
have foraged at all during the study. Of the 20 animals which were
seen to move, not every one foraged every day. Only the 20 foraging
limpets were included in this analysis of homing behavior. The
average total distance travelled by an animal in one foray was about
5cm.
Homing was defined as returning to the same site that was
occupied before the onset of foraging at high tide, and taking up
the precise previous orientation. This was determined by alignment
of the painted dots and good fit to the substrate, as far as
