possibly resulting from traumatizing the animals when removing them
from the rock. A set of lab experiments was therefore done, where
disturbance to the limpet was minimized.
8 C. scabra, maintained in the sea-table and observed over 5-11
"high tides" to forage and to home consistently during this period,
were used as subjects. Controls were 30 other limpets which had been
similarly observed in the sea-table. When an experimental C. scabra
was foraging at least 5cm away from its home site, its rock was tilted
so that the limpet was barely submerged. Then an area around the
home site about 4-5cm in radius was heated intensively with a
propane torch. The rock was then re-submerged, and the sea-table
was allowed to drain slowly in simulation of a falling tide.
5 out of 8 limpets returned to their burned-out home sites with
no apparent hesitation in comparison to the controls. 2 Of 3 non-homers
returned to the area of the home site, but while traversing the
heated region, encountered patches of a crumbly brown substance,
possibly an encrusting alga burned by the heating process. The animals
did not traverse this substance, but turned away from it, or attempted
to reach the home site from another approach. This was not possible
beeause these patches completely surrounded the home sites. The
remaining non-homer did not even turn around to head toward home upon
the onset of "low tide," as the others had done. This limpet may
have been disturbed by the heating, or it may have been in the
process of changing its home site.
Displacement experiments.
All of the previous experiments involved limpets homing on their
