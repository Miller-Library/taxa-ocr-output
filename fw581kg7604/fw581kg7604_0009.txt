own rocks, whether in field or in the lab. In the following
experiments, limpets were taken from the field and placed on glass or
rock in the sea-table, and subjected to two high tides per day for
over 3 weeks.
Animals which were placed on glass ranged from.4-2cm in length.
Some limpets crawled off the glass at the beginning of the study.
Those which remained grew their shells to conform to the flat surface.
No homing was observed. At each high tide the animals would either
reorient themselves slightly, or move to a new place altogether.
Within 2 weeks, the larger limpets, 1.5-2.0cm in length, had grown
new shell around the bottom edge, discernible as a 1-2mm wide band
of lighter, thinner shell, conforming exactly to the glass.
Those limpets which were placed on new rocks were 1.0-2.Ocm in
length. During the first few "high tides," they wandered on the
rock, not returning to any previously occupied site (i.e., no homing).
After 3-4 "high tides," the limpets merely reoriented themselves by
180Â° on spots which, in one direction, seemed to fit their shells
fairly well. They continued this behavior regularly with the changes
of the tides until, in 1-2 weeks, they began homing behavior, leaving
these sites at "high tide" and returning to them at the onset of "low
tide." By this time their shells conformed very well to thiser new
sites.
Home site transplantation experiments.
A final series of experiments involved transplanting an animal
and its home site to new substrate. C. scabra home sites often occur
on superficial crystals in the granite. A sharp tap with a chisel
