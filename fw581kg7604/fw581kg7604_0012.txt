paths back to their homes after their initial foraging run. On
occasion they were seen to return home by the same path, and toward
the end of the study some animals were seen to take a circular route.
Further study is warranted on this topic. Perhaps, as hypothesized
above for developing limpets, the displaced animals follow a chemical
trail at first, until they become familiar with the surroundings.
Burning experiments could be performed with these animals as soon as
they begin to forage, to test this idea.
