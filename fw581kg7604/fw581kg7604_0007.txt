For all lab experiments, artificial high and low tides were
created in an outdoor sea-table (Figure 3). "Low tide" was
brought about by allowing only a small amount of sea water to run
into the table, and by placing a short, hollow plug in the drain, so
that the water level remained at about 3", and all the experimental
limpets were left high and dry. "High tide" was caused by replacing
the short plug with a taller one, and turning on "splash" from
perforated tubing connected between water nozzles above the sea-table.
All test animals were gradually submerged and able to forage. In this
manner, the limpets were subjected to two high tides per day, one at
about 8 a.m., and the other at about 7 p.m., each of 2-3 hours duration.

Home site burning experiments.
Home site burnings were first carried out in the field. 20
limpets, 1-1.8cm in length, were selected on one rock face. All were
marked as in the small limpet experiments described in Part I. 10 of
these were removed from the rock at low tide. A circular area of radius
6-8cm, centered on the limpet's home site, was intensively heated with
a propane torch. After the rock had cooled, the limpets were
replaced on the rock 8cm from their home sites, aimed tangentially
to the treated area, and slightly wetted with sea water to aid in
sticking. 10 controls were similarly removed and replaced, on nonÂ¬
torched areas. Results are shown in Table 1.
By the second high tide after treatment of the limpets, there
did not appear to be any difference in the behavior of the two groups
of animals. The controls fared as poorly as the burned C. scabra,
