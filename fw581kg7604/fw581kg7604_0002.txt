PART I: Homing behavior of small individuals of the limpet
Collisella scabra.
Introduction
A distinctive characteristic of the limpet Collisella scabra is
its ability to return to a very specific "home" site after foraging
on the rock while awash or submerged. This phenomenon was recently
reviewed by BRANCH (1981). Although homing in C. scabra has been
studied quite extensively, the exact mechanism is still unknown.
Homing behavior in relation to size of the limpet was studied
by JESSEE (1968). His results indicated that there was no significant
difference between the homing behavior of large C. scabra, greater
than 15mm in length, and that of small limpets between 6 and 10mm
long. He suggests, however, that individuals smaller than 6mm long
do not usually home. HEWATT (1940) had previously suggested that
C. scabra less than 14mm in length do not home.
The present study was undertaken to determine whether small C.
scabra have the ability to home, and whether the homing is a constant
occurence. My results show that C. scabra less than Amm long can
indeed home, and that there is less rigidity in homing, i.e. a
higher rate of home site changing, than shown in a previous study of
larger limpets (BRANT, 1950).
Materials and methods
The C. scabra studied were located on gently sloping granite.
between 2 and 3 feet above MLLW, on a protected shore of Mussel Point.
Pacific Grove, California. 26 individuals were chosen and measured
with calipers. They were grouped into 3 size classes: less than 2mm
