Hypoxia in Aquaria
Figure 2a shows the decrease of dissolved oxygen in the two aquaria
as Ã  function of time immediately after turning on air/ nitrogen
mixture. Time at 0 minutes marks the introduction of the air/
nitrogen mixture through air stones in the aquaria. This graph
demonstrates that fish experienced hypoxic concentrations of
oxygen (1.5- 2.5 mg/1) after 2 hours of bubbling with air/ nitrogen
mixture. Oxygen levels ranged from 1 to 2.6 mg/L throughout the
course of the experiment. Fluctuations in oxygen levels for all 7
days are seen in figure 2b.
LDH Assay Per Gram Wet Weight of Liver
Figure 3 and table 1 show that mean LDH activity per gram wet
weight of liver increases in fish under hypoxia as compared to that
of the fish in the normoxic control aquarium. There is a 50%
increase in LDH activity after one day of hypoxia and then a decrease
in activity in the day 2, 4, and 7 time points. These results are not
significant (p= .08) due to large amounts of variance in LDH activity
among the fish in each treatment,
