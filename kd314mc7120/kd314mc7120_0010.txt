minutes. All assays were done in a Beckman DU- 7
spectrophotometer at 25° C. Each assay was replicated 2-3 times,
Assay for Protein Concentration
Amount of protein in the supernatant was determined with the
Bradford method (Bradford, 1976). A microassay was done using 15
ul supernatant, 785 ul water and 200 ul of Bradford reagent (Bio¬
Rad Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was used as a standard.
Calculations
Units of LDH per gram fresh weight were calculated with the
following formula:
Units = [(AÖD per minute)X (assay volume (mi)))- [(.63 ml umol¬
mm- (NADH extinction coefficient)) X (10 mm (light path distance))
X(mass of sample (9)))
Units per milligram protein was calculated with the same formula
but expressed per milligram protein instead of grams liver.
Data Analysis
A fully nested ANÖVA with three levels was done on LDH activity per
gram wet weight of tissue. This would account for variance due to
