aquaria by a small air pump. Preliminary experiments showed these
flow rates produced hypoxic oxygen concentrations of generally
between 1.5 to 2.5 mg/ liter within the aquaria. High enough flow
rates were used to keep oxygen concentrations constant in spite of
removal of oxygen by fish respiration. Bubble wrap was placed over
the water in the two aquaria. This prevented ambient oxygen from
entering the water by simple diffusion. Dissolved oxygen
measurements were taken approximately every 30 minutes in order
to monitor the drop in oxygen level at the onset of hypoxia and were
taken once daily throughout the course of the experiment
A third 55 gallon aquarium was equipped with a separate filtration/
aeration device and maintained at about 7.5 mg/ I oxygen. This
aquarium was designated for normoxic control fish. All tanks were
filled with seawater from Monterey Bay, California at approximately
20Â°.
Experimental Design
Several days before the onset of the hypoxic treatment, fish were
moved into the three large aquaria. At the start of the experiment
there were 10 fish in the control aquarium, and 38 fish divided
between the two hypoxia aquaria. Five control fish were sampled
and bubbling of air/ nitrogen mixture was started,
Fish in the hypoxic tanks were taken out and dissected exactly one
day, two days, four days, and seven days after the nitrogen gas was
