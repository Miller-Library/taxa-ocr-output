Short Term Response to Environmental Hypoxia
LDH activity in Fundulus heteroclitus liver increases in the first
days of exposure to a hypoxic environment. There is a statistically
significant two- fold increase in LDH activity per mg protein
relative to the control after 2 days of hypoxia.
In the study by Greaney et al. (1980) LDH activity per mg protien
rose from 2. 82 + .143 (mean + S.E.) in control fish to 3.95 + .274
after two weeks in hypoxia. These levels persisted until about 5
weeks when they dropped possibly due to a long-term erthrocyte
response. The present findings show, LDH activity increased by 2
days of hypoxia showing that the response is much quicker.
LDH activities then decreased back to almost the levels of the
control in days 4, and 7. Statistical tests demonstrate no
significant difference between hypoxia day 4, and 7 and the control.
Do LDH levels really increase after two days, decrease by day 7 and
then increase again by day 14 as suggested by combining our and
Greaney's data? It would follow that LDH levels increase after 2
days of hypoxia, and remain high until 5 weeks later when the long
term response eliminates the need for increased glycolytic activity
It could be that LDH activities in day 4 and 7 are truly higher than
the control, and that large amounts of variance within each
