A more accurate determination of LDH activity is the LDH activity
per milligram protein the supernatant. There are other components
in liver besides protein such as lipids and sugars (especially
glycogen) whose amounts can potentially differ in different livers,
These differences can be factored out by expressing LDH activity per
mg protein.
LDH activity per mg protein was calculated by dividing the mean
change in LDH optical density for the replicates by their mean
protein amount. These means are shown in figure 4 and table 2.
Mean LDH activities of hypoxic fish are consistently higher than the
controls. After 2 days of hypoxia LDH activity is 170% of the
control. Averages then drop in day 4 and 7 but remain slightly more
than the control. There is statistically significant difference among
all treatments (p Â« .05 as shown in table 4). Difference between the
normoxic control LDH activity and the average of all hypoxia time
points is significant at p= .012. When the mean LDH activity for
each day of hypoxia is compared to the control, tukey's T test
demonstrates significance in only that of the control ys. hypoxia day
