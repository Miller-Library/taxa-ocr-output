treatment resulted in the lack of statistically significant
differences between treatments.
There are a number of potential sources of error in this experiment
One potential source of variance was genetic variability between
fish. Fundulus heteroclitus is known to be made up of a genetically
distinct northern and southern type. The northern type has been
shown to have a liver LDH activity twice that of the southern
(Powers et al., 1994). F. heteroclitus from the Woods Hole area are
known to be about 75 percent northern type and 25 percent southern
type (Powers and Place, 1978). Because the exact type of each fish
in the experiment was not assessed, it is not known to what degree
different F. heteroclitus types effected the variance of the
treatment averages.
Ã–ther possibly significant sources of error were stresses other than
hypoxia. One of these stresses, disease, may have had a significant
effect on LDH activity by possibly altering metabolic rates of the
fish. A second stress was human interactions and handling. Sending
fish by mail over long distances as well as being kept in a setting
characterized by a lot of human movement, may also have altered
metabolic rates and thus affected LDH activities (Fries, 1986).
A third source of error was the human error involved in making
homogenates and doing assays for LDH. An effort was made to
account for error in the LDH assay procedure by doing replicate or
triplicate assays for each fish. LDH was expressed as a function of
