Now that we have an idea of when LDH is produced, we may look at
the molecular level for possible factors which enhance LDH
production when hypoxic conditions are present. It has been shown
in rat and human cell cultures that a Hypoxia- inducible Factor (HIF)
promotes the transcription of mRNA which encodes for LDH.
According to this research, mRNA encoding LDH is transcribed 2- 3
times more in cell cultures after 16 hours of hypoxia. (Semenza et
al., 1994) It is also known that HIF triggers not only mRNA for LDH
and other glycolytic enzymes but also the erythropoietin hormone
involved in a long-term response to hypoxia (Goldberg et al., 1991).
An experiment looking for mRNA which encodes for LDH, other
glycolytic enzymes, and the erythropoietin hormone over several
time points from one day to several weeks under hypoxia would
compliment these findings and the findings of Greaney's research.
FÃ¼rther analysis of the DNA for HIF binding sites would help form
the big picture as to exactly what biochemical changes occur due to
hypoxia and if HIF induces them.
The relatively quick response to low oxygen environments seems to
indicate a beneficial adaptation of F. heteroclitus to withstand
areas of low oxygen in its natural habitat. Esturarine areas where
the fish lives are often characterized by slow-moving or stagnant
bodies of water containing large amounts of organic material and
potentially low levels of oxygen. If the fish is somehow trapped in a
