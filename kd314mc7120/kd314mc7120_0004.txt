Introduction
Hypoxia, or low oxygen concentration, can have profound effects on
organisms dependent on aerobic metabolism for a majority of their
energy production. One way in which organisms respond to hypoxia
is by altering the quantity or functioning of certain enzymes. One
enzyme of key interest in studies on hypoxia is lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), which is the terminal enzyme in anaerobic
glycolysis. Glycolysis results in the breakdown of glucose with the
formation of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules. When oxygen is present
in the cell, the products of glycolysis, pyruvate and NADH, can be
used to produce more ATP through the Krebs cycle and electron
transport. When oxygen is not present LDH converts pyruvate to
lactate and oxidizes NADH to NAD+. Because NAD+ is a substrate of
other enzymes in glycolysis, its regeneration is essential for the
breakdown of glucose and production of energy in times of low
oxygen concentration in the cell.
Because LDH is important under anaerobic conditions, 1 hypothesized
that one response of cells exposed to hypoxia would be to produce
higher levels of LDH. Semenza et al., (1994) demonstrated that LDH
in human HeLa cell cultures is produced at 2 to 3 times normal
levels when they are exposed to hypoxia. Ã–ther research confirms
this type of increase in mammalian cell cultures (Robin et al., 1984).
The purpose of the experiment presented here is to demonstrate the
effects of hypoxia on LDH production in the fish Fundulus
