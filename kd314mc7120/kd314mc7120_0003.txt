Abstract
Previous studies have shown that the activity of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) in liver of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus
increases approximately two- fold after two weeks of hypoxia.
However, nothing is known about the early response of LDH activity
to hypoxia. In this study the effects of shorter durations of hypoxia
on LDH activities in Fundulus heteroclitus were examined. Hypoxia
was induced in aquaria by gassing with an air/ nitrogen mixture.
After 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of hypoxia fish were killed and livers
prepared for LDH assays. LDH activity in liver of Fundulus
heteroclitus increased two- fold after two days of hypoxia. This
finding demonstrates that the response to hypoxia in Fundulus
heteroclitus is much faster than previous research has suggested.
These results in F. heteroclitus are consistent with previous
findings that mRNA encoding LDH increases after 16 hours of hypoxia
in human cell cultures. Possible molecular mechanisms underlying
the hypoxia- induced increase in LDH activity are discussed.
