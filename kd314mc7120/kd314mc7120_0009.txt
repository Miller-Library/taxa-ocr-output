türned on. Six fish were taken at each time point. On the fourth day
the remaining four fish in the control tank were sampled.
Fish were quickly decapitated, weighed and their livers excised The
liver was divided in two parts and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70°c.
Frozen liver was weighed and then transfered to a small Dounce
homogenizer. Homogenization solution (50 mM NaHPOJ/NaH»POA, pH
7.00, and 1 mM EDTA (disodium salt) with 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol
added fresh) was added to the liver sample such that there was
always .025 milligrams of tissue per microliter of solution. The
tissue homogenate was then centrifuged at 4°C at 10,000 X g for 30
minutes. Supernatants were removed and stored on ice until
assayed.
Assay for LDH Activity
LDH activity was determined by measuring the rate of oxidation of
NADH to NAD- in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. NADH
absorbs 340 nm light while NAD+ does not. As a result, NADH
oxidation results in a decrease in absorbance (Vassault, 1983). The
assay solution contained 0.1 M NaHPOY/NaHzPO4 (pH 7.5), 2.64 mM
pyruvate and 0.34 mM NADH (from Sigma Chemical Company)
(Greaney et al., 1980). 5 microliters of supernatant was added to 3
mi of assay solution and change in absorbance was recorded for two
