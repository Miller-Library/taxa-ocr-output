hypoxic body of water due to, for example, lowering tides, it must
gear its biochemical machinery for the prevailing conditions in order
to survive.
Exactly at what time this response should be seen in Fundulus
depends on other factors than just a decrease in environmental
oxygen concentration. Fish behavior is of key importance to the
levels of oxygen that are found in blood and interstitial fluid in the
fish. Increased ventilation of the gills could result in stable levels
of blood oxygen concentrations even while outside environmental
concentrations drop. In addition physiological changes such as
vasodilation of arteries around the gills, increased heart rate and
expanded blood volume would all contribute to a stable oxygen
concentration in the tissues. These responses to hypoxia all delay
decreases in oxygen concentration within the cells until the
environmental oxygen concentration reaches a point where no
fürther continuation of these responses can maintain O» levels.
In conclusion, a definite response to hypoxia was found in LDH
levels. This response was found to be within 2 days after begining
the hypoxia treatment. Using these results as a starting point we
hope to elucidate the molecular mechanism which triggers increased
LDH production.
