Materials and Methods
Animals
Wild Fundulus heteroclitus were obtained from Woods Hole,
Massachusetts one month before onset of the experiment. This long
acclimation time was necessary to reduce potential handling effects
resulting from shipment and changes in water quality or
temperature between Woods Hole and Hopkins Marine Station. These
fish were placed in 10 gallon aquaria with filtered seawater at 20Â°0
and fed once daily.
Hypoxia Apparatus
An apparatus for producing hypoxic conditions in aquaria was
designed and built as shown in figure 1. Two 55 gallon aquaria were
placed next to each other. A submersible pump was used to pump
water from the lower aquarium through a canister filter and into the
upper aquarium. The second aquarium was raised so that water
would flow by siphon through a hose back into the lower aquarium.
Valves on the siphon hose and the pump outflow were adjusted to
maintain a steady level of water in both aquaria. Hypoxia was
induced in the aquaria by bubbling an air/ nitrogen gas mixture
through two air stones in each aquarium. This mixture was created
by feeding nitrogen into a 10 gallon gas mixing chamber with a
loosely fitting lid. Pure nitrogen at a flow rate of 1 liter per minute
mixed with air coming in at the top of the tank, and this mixture
was pumped at a constant rate of 1.3 liters per minute into the two
