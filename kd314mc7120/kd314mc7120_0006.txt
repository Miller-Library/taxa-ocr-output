What is not accounted for by Greaney et al., (1980) is exactly when
the short- term response begins. Work by Semenaza et al., (1994)
nas shown that hypoxia induces an increase in transcription of mRNA
encoding LDH in HeLa and Hep3B cell cultures within 16 hours. From
these results, I hypothesized that Fundulus heteroclitus LDH
activity may respond to hypoxia much sooner than the first time
point of two weeks in Greaney's study, perhaps between 16 to 72
hours after the onset of hypoxic conditions.
