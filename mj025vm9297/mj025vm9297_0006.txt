with the animals totally submerged infresh seawater. The
results were similar for all the tests: out of 64 choice
situations, 52 responses were away from the light, two were
toward the light, and ten showed no response.
HOMING BEHAVIOR
My activity studies showed that the chitons' overall
activity is greater during periods when they are not submerged.
In those studies, some animals returned to their starting
points after periods of movement while others did not.
To examine further the incidence of homing behavior,
marked 84 chitons with numbered labels and recorded their
positions once daily during low tide for 14 days, starting
April 27th, 1974. Homing was considered to exist when
animals were repeatedly found in a precise location or homeÂ¬
site. Only ten of these animals displayed homing over the
entire period, while another 22 homed for periods varying
from three to thirteen days. I displaced the eleven most
consistent homers not more than 10 cm from their respective
homes. Only two returned home within 24 hours; three weeks
later, only one was found in its original home.
I returned on June Ist to the same area at low tide
and attempted to locate the 84 marked chitons. One-third
(28) were found, of which 17, though for the most part not
in their original homesites, were still in their original
areas (either under the same Pelvetia clump or not more than
20 cm from it). Of the remaining eleven animals, nine had
moved to different Pelvetia clumps ranging from 30 to 104 cm
