Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax

INTRODUCTION
The chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter, 1855) has
been studied taxonomically (e.g., Tryon and Pilsbry, 1992:
Berry, 1922), and Ricketts and Calvin (1952) note that the
chiton is found under clumps of Pelvetia during the day and
prefers relatively quiet waters. There appears to be little
known about the animal beyond this. To gather more information
on its biology I observed the daily and nightly activities
of a population of C. hartwegii on Mussell Point in Pacific
Grove, California, during the spring of 1974. My findings
on when and where the animals move, their homing behavior
and phototactic behavior are herein reported along with a
discussion on possible selective advantages of this behavior.
HABITAT OF CYANOPLAX
The Mussel Point Cyanoplax hartwegii were commonly found
under the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata (J. G. Agardh) DeToni
in areas of moderate or weak surf action. The animals were
generally on bare granite or on the encrusting red algae
Hildenbrandia occidentalis Setchell, Petrocelis franciscana
Setchell and Gardner, or crustose corallines. Numerous
tufts of the red algae Gigartina papillata (C. A. Agardh)
J. G. Agardh, Endocladia muricata (Postels and Ruprecht)
J. G. Agardh and some Corallina officinalis Linnaeus were found
in these areas. Such mobile fauna as the snail Tegula
funebralis (Adams, 1854), the limpets Acmaea pelta Eschscholtz,
