1833, A. digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833, A. limatula Carpenter, 1864,
and A. scabra (Gould, 1846), the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes
Randall, 1839, the hermit crabs, Pagurus spp. and a variety
of gammarid amphipods were frequently found in all my study
areas. Of the sessile animals present, the anemone
Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835), the small barnacle
Chthamalus sp. and the annelid worm Phragmatopoma californica
(Fewkes, 1889) were the most common.
ACTIVITY PATTERNS
To mark individual chitons whose movements were to be
followed, small numbered labels of waterproof paper were
attached to the shell plates utilizing a reportedly non-toxic,
quick-drying contact glue ("ZIP-GRIP" 10; Devcon Corporation,
Danvers, Mass.). To monitor the positions of the chitons,
I used a 50 cm x 50 cm grid marked off in 10 cm intervals
which was aligned to marked reference points on the transect
during times of data collection.
To investigate the chitons' diurnal activity patterns,
I labelled in situ thirteen Cyanoplax hartwegii from Mussel
Point found living within an area approximately 3 mxIm
between the +2.5 and +4.0 foot tidal levels. Starting
approximately 6 hours after the labelling, the animals were
observed at one hour intervals begiining at 1800 on May 13th
and ending at 2000 on May 15th, and their positions were
recorded for each observation. Night-time observations were
