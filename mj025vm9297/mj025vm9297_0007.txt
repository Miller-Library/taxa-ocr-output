away. Only two left the Pelvetia community altogether and
both were found on exposed granite among clusters of Anthopleura
elegantissima. One had traveled 65 cm., and the other had
gone an impressive 186 cm., made notable by the fact that.
in order to reach this new area, the animal either had to
cross a stretch of sand, or follow a rather lengthy, circuitous
route over a rock bridge.
The above results clearly show that individual chitons
may reside at, or consistently return to, a homesite for a
period of at least two weeks, and they indicate that homing
is a rather transient phenomenon. However, the results
of the activity studis show that at low tide, when observations
for homing were made, more of the chitons are moving and, therefore,
they are less likely to be in their homesites. Thus, the chitons
may be more consistent in their homing behavior than my studies
suggest.
DISCUSSION
In populations of Cyanoplax hartwegii living under
Pelvetia, movement was mainly nocturnal. Some animals were
active during the day, which behavior may in part be related
to the fact that the Pelvetia affords some protection from
heat, desiccation, and predation. The chitons moved more
during periods when they were dry or awash than while submerged.
This is not the case for the chiton Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846)
