Lyman Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax

using a dim red flashlight. A second set of hourly observations
was made on the same population from 2000 on May 19th to 0800
on May 22nd, a time when the tidal cycle was six to seven
hours out of phase with the previous cycle. The number of
animals located each hour varied from ten to all thirteen.
The results of the two watches are shown in Figures 1
and 2. These indicate that the animals moved much more at
night than in the day, a pattern observed in other species
of polyplacophorans (Heath, 1899; Glynn, 1970; Smith, 1974).
There is also an indication that the animals moved more
when they were dry (completely exposed to air) or awash
(covered less than half the time by lapping waves) than
when they were submerged (covered more than half the time).
Assignments of the categories "awash", "submerged" and "dry'
were subjective and conditions could vary at one particular
tidal height, depending upon the surge. The relation of
activity to tidal height and conditions of exposure to sea
and air is illustrated in Figure 4. In Figure 3, the data
is organized to show the relationship of activity to conditions
of tidal exposure and the light cycle.
During the day, fewer animals moved when submerged than
when dry (Mann-Whitney U-Test; P(.001) or awash (P(.01).
and a slightly larger number moved when dry than when awash
(.I( PV.2). For the average distance moved, there is a
similar relationship: lesser movement while submerged than
awash (.05(P(.1) or dry (P(.05) and slightly greater
movement when dry than when awash (.2 (P (.4). A night.
