Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax
FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. Activity patterns of 13 Cyanoplax hartwegii
observed hourly from May 13th to May 15th, 1974.
A. Conditions of tide and light. The horizontal bars
indicate tidal exposure of Cyanoplax: S - submerged,
D = dry, and blacked out areas - awash. Light
cycle is indicated on each graph.
B. Total number of animals that moved each hour.
C. Average distance moved by the animals each hour.
Figure 2. Activity patterns of 13 Cyanoplax hartwegii observed
hourly from May 19th to May 22nd, 1974. Key and explanations
are the same as in Figure 1.
Figure 3. Activity shown in relation to conditions of tidal
exposure and the light cycle. The bottom of the vertical
bars indicate the minimum levels of activity recorded
for a given condition. The top indicates the maximum
and the line within the bar indicates the mean of recorded
values. Clear bars represent data from May 13th to May
15th; stippled bars represent data from May 19th to May 22nd.
A. Total number of animals that moved.
B. Average distance moved by the animals.
Figure 4. Activity versus the tidal height. Approximate
conditions of tidal exposure are indicated on horizontal
bar. Dotted line represents activity from May 13th to
