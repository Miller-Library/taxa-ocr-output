Lyman Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax
whose activity is far greater when submerged (Smith, 1974).
Possible advantages of this behavior to Cyanoplax are discussed
below.
Many Cyanoplax hartwegii are located on smooth rock, and
they cling less firmly and are thus more readily dislodged
from the rock substratum than Mopalia muscosa or Nuttallina
californica (Reeve, 1847), which are found in the same area.
It is possible that the strength of the surge is strong
enough to detach moving Cyanoplax, but not ones which are
inactive on the rock.
Another possible advantage of decreased activity during
submerged periods is suggested by Connor (1974) and concerns
the animal's diet. Cyanoplax hartwegii were frequently
observed feeding on Pelvetia and this alga makes up the
great bulk of their gut contents (Robb, 1974). While the
Cyanoplax are submerged, the Pelvetia clumps, attached by one
relatively small holdfast to the rock, are afloat and
considerably agitated by the surge. This would make feeding
on the thallus difficult. This is not the case when the chitons
are merely awash or dry, and it is during these periods, in
the day or night when Pelvetia lies prostrate on the rocks,
that I have observed the animals feeding onbranches of the
alga.
Although I did not find consistent homing behavior in
Cyanoplax hartwegii, they did appear to prefer certain areas
on the substrate to others. These "campsites" were frequently
occupied by a chiton during the animal's less active periods.
