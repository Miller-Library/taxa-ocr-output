Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax
page 9
Sometimes the same chiton would home to one location consistently
for days, but eventually it would leave and another Cyanoplax
would take its place. There were over a dozen such locations
on the transect used for the two lengthy watches and I could
see this phenomenon occurring in other transects where I
had marked C. hartwegii. The high frequency of habitation of
these particular sites versus other possible sites suggests
strongly that these sites are "recognizable" by the
animals, possibly by recognition of chemical cues. Thorne
(1967) suggests that such an accumulation of chemicals on the
substratum at the homesite is the cue for homing in the chiton
Acanthozostera gemmata (Blainville). Most of the sites
appeared to offer the Cyanoplax some protection, being
located in a crevice, depression, tidepool, or among
Phragmatopoma or Anthopleura elegantissima. It seems
likely, whatever the mechanism involved, that this behavior
has some survival value for the animal, such as consistent
protection from desiccation.
SUMMARY
1. The chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii found on Mussel Point in
Pacific Grove, California under the brown alga Pelvetia
fastigiata, is more active at night and is negatively phototactic
in the lab. Progection afforded by the Pelvetia habitat might
explain the considerable daytime activity that does occur.
2. The tidal cycle affects the animals' activity, greatest
