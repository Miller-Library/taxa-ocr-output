Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax
page 5
activity patterns were similar-i.e., the animals moved more y
when awash (P £.002) or dry (P (.002) than when submerged.
Their activity was approximately equal during both their dry
and awash paeriods. Contrasting diurnal with nocturnal
patterns, more animals were moving nightly while submerged
(.05(P (.1), awash (P(.001), and dry (P£.001) than during
the day. They also moved greater distances at night while
awash (.02( P (.04) and dry (P(.002) than during the day.
There was very little difference between day and night
movement when they were submerged (P(.1).
PHOTOTACTIC BEHAVIOR
Negative phototaxis has been observed in some chiton
species (Crozier, 1920; Heath, 1899; Westersund, 1974) and is
possibly related to their nocturnal behavior; consequently
I tested Cyanoplax hartwegii for a light response. Sixteen
animals, laboratory and dark adapted for 12 days, were placed
in the middle of a shallow tray, with eight facing toward a
light source and eight away. The light source was a 500-watt
incandescent bulb placed about six inches above one end of
the tray and about 11 inches away from the chitons. After
the chitons had settled (usually two to three minutes), the
light was turend on for twenty minutes. I ran four trials
with the same sixteen chitons, rinsing and turning the tray
180° and allowing the animals to dark adapt for 30 minutes
between trials. The first three trials were run with the
animals on a thin film of seawater. Hoping to diminish
any response to heat from the bulb, I ran the fourth test
