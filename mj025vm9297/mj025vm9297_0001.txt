Activity Patterns of Cyanoplax
LYMAN
ABSTRACT
The chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter, 1855), found inter-
tidally on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California under the brown
alga Pelvetia fastigiata (J. G. Agardh) DeToni, was found to be more
active at night and negatively phototactic in the lab. Protection
afforded by the Pelvetia habitat could explain the considerable day-
time activity that does occur. The tidal cycle affected the animals'
activity, greatest activity occurring at dry and awash periods.
Lesser activity during the high tides may be due to the strength of
the surge or to the difficulty in feeding on Felvetia during these
times. Although strict homing was not exhibited by the C. hartwegii,
certain "campsites on the substratum were occupied successively by
different individuals. This behavior may have survival significance,
as these campsites may be consistently well-protected spots.
