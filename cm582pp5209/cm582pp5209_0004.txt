I. paleacea on P. torreyi
represent a random sample with respect to previous time spent on a blade.
Statistically the mean blade residency time for first day occupied blades
is expected to equal half the actual mean residency time. Calculated
from a mean blade residency time for first day occupied blades of 2.88
days, the actual mean blade residency time for N. paleacea on Phyllospadix
torreyi is 5.76 days. This analysis is supported by blade number one
(figure 2). Offering a known beginning and ending time of blade occupancy,
its blade residency time of five days corresponds closely with derived
mean blade residency of 5.76 days. N. paleacea also reappeared on
abandoned P. torreyi blades. The extent of this reoccurrence was always
limited to one observation period.
Rates of consumption of Phyllospadix torreyi by Notoacmea paleacea
were determined in an outside aquarium under natural sunlight in unfiltered
running sea water at 15 + 1Â° C. Twelve ungrazed blades, each approximately
25 cm long, were suspended on a wooden rack in order to keep them separated.
Collected N. paleacea were transfered to these blades. Lengths and
locations of grazed patches were recorded over the following three day
period. After observations were completed, two 20 cm portions of grazed
and ungrazed blades were dryed overnight and weighed.
Data for consumption rates of Phyllospadix torreyi is presented in
figure 3. Of the initial 12 Notoacmea paleacea, only 8 survived through
the third day. The total length of P. torreyi eaten per day is X - 24.42
mm (S.D. - 19.69) while the length eaten per day considering only the
third day is X - 38.63 mm (S.D. - 14.45). M. paleacea were considered
dead when they dropped from their blades and no jonger exhibited the
ability to reattach. Grazed patches were easy to see and measure. After
the three day observation period, the blades were collected, and dryed.
