N. paleacea on P. torreyi

relationship. Without controls on the grazing rates of Notoacmea
paleacea, irreparable damage to the P. torreyi population is inevitable.
Evidence towards the existence of such a limiting mechanism is found in
the residency period study (figure 2). Residency periods seem to be of
two types: a full period of residence lasting an average of 5.76 days
and an abbreviated residence time lasting a maximum of one day (actual
abbreviated period is unknown). Itiis suggested that full residency
(5.76 days) indicates an average period the blade is occupied for grazing
while abbreviated residency indicates that the blade was found unsuitable
for grazing. If this is the case, residence on blades by N. paleacea
is not random, but involves a selective process. Perhaps N. paleacea
can recognize recent residency on a blade. The suggested selection
against previously occupied blades would effectively control overgrazing.
Such a mechanism limiting overgrazing is clearly advantagous to
both Phyllospadix torreyi and Notoacmea paleacea. With the extreme
effects of grazing on photosynthetic capacities, overgrazing would be a
serious detriment to the blades. A mechanism limiting grazing ensures
that the P. torreyi population will not be irreparably damaged. Notoacmea
in turn is dependant upon the prosperity of its host Phyllospadix torreyi.
