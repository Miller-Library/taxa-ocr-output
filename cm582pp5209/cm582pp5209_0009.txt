N. paleacea on P. torreyi
Gansel, J. A.
SUMMARY
1. Distribution studies indicate that differences in Notoacmea
paleacea population body sizes correspond to factors of wave intensity
and desiccation from exposure to air.
2. The mean grazing rate on Phyllospadix torrevi is 38.63 mm of
blade length per day or approximately 220 mm over an average grazing
residency of 5.67 days. N. paleacea consumes about 1.7 mg per day dry
weight of P. torreyi.
3. Grazing results in over a 302 loss in photosynthetic capacity.
4. Gut analysis shows P torreyi epidermal cells constitute about
85% of the diet of N. paleacea with small amounts of xylem cells and
diatoms making up the remainder.
5. Periods of residency of individual limpets on blades of
Phyllospadix torrevi may be grouped into two categories: full residency
periods of 5.76 days and abbreviated residency periods of one observation.
6 Full residency periods indicate grazing behavior while
abbreviated residency periods indicate rejection of the blade as a food
source. This points to the existence of a mechanism that enables
N. paleacea to detect previous residency. This mechanism controls
overgrazing, a control that is critical to the success of P. torreyi and
N. paleacea.
