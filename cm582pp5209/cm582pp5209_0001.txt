N. paleacea on P. torreyi.
Gansel, J. A.
INTRODUCTION
The geographic range of the Pacific North American surfgrass,
Phyllospadix torreyi (Wats) extends from Oregon doun to Baja California
(Munz and Keck, 1963). A root system consisting of rhizoids anchors
to rocks and coarse sands in the lower intertidal regions. This
position in the intertidal provides a buffer against desiccation and
exposure. Air pockets permeate the P. torreyi blades possibly increasing
internal photosynthetic capacity (Barbour and Radosevich, 1979).
Additionally, these air pockets provide the necessary bouyancy to suspend
the blades as a dynamic forest and prevent entanglement with other bottom
masses. Beneath the water's surface and suspended above the bottom, the
surfgrass blade community offers a reasonably well protected habitat to
any lightweight organism capable of holding on.
The chaffy limpet, Jotoacmea paleacea (Gould), is one archeogastropod
that seems to have responded to this challenge particularly well. Several
major modifications leave N. paleacea ideally adapted to Phyllospadix
species. Conforming in shell width to the width of the blade, N. paleacea
can withdraw all body tissues into its shell to effectively grasp the
blade (lab and field observations). A notch along the right side of the
nuchal cavity coupled with rapid ciliary currents allows water circulation
and waste removal without relinguishing that grasp (Yonge, 1962). Even
defense mechanisms seem centered on remaining in contact with the blades,
Where other small gastropods display mushrooming and abandoning behavior
to avoid predation, I. paleacea simply clamps down tighter and relies on
chemical camouflaging (Fishlyn and Phillips, 1980). Rounding out its
specificity to Phyllospadix species, 1. paleacea also relies on the blades
as a food source.
Parasitism seems to best describe the symbiotic relationship between
