II. paleacea on P. torreyi
a natural breakwater. At low minus tides the collection site consists of
numerous shallow tide pools which are succeptable to dessication. At
high tides, the area is submerged and strong surf is again broken up.
Hest Beach has very little protection against strong wave action.
At low minus tides the collection site becomes a channel washed by broken
waves. At high tide, direct wave contact results in a relatively high
energy environment.
Distribution data is presented in figure 1. This data suggests that
N. paleacea body sizes are a function of their environment. Statistically,
(student "T"-test) all mean lengths and mean heights are significantly
different (p Â£ 0.01) except for length comparisons of Stillwater Cove and
West Beach (0.1 2 p 20.05) and height comparisons of Bird Rock Channel
and West Beach (0.2 2 p 20.1). Statistics suggest that the populations
are overall significantly different in size. This difference corresponds
to the differences observed in wave and desiccative exposure.
Determination of Notoacmea paleacea residency times involved
selectively marking blades of Phyllospadix torreyi with tagged wires.
Observations over a seven day period regarding residency were made on 25
blades chosen for their initial habitation by N. paleacea. Approximate
shell size was also recorded to ensure that the same N. paleacea were
being observed from day to day. All observations for distribution and
field studies took place during spring at low minus tides. Collection
samples included both the residing N. paleacea and the blade occupied.
Data from the blade residency time study appears in figure 2. All
25 blades were occupied by a separate Notoacmea paleacea on day 1 but by
day 2 only 84% (21 of 25) remained occupied. Blade number one represents
a limpet which joined the study after day one. Blades were chosen
because the were occupied by N. paleacea. It was assumed these limpets
