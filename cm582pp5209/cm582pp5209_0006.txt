for photosynthetic activity. Each sample was placed in a respirometer
flask under 10 ml of unfiltered sea water and buffered with 1 ml of a
0.035 M. KHCO, and 0.065 M. NaHcO, solution in the side arm of the flask.
The running temperature was set to 15Â° C., the shaking motor to 5, and
light at the blades was measured at 247 microeinsteins / me : sec. After
allowing for a 20 minute equilibration period, observations were recorded
every 15 minutes for 135 minutes. At the end of the observation period,
the blades were recovered, dryed, and weighed.
After dividing by dry weights, photosynthetic capacity was graphed
in figure 4. Choosing a common period of relatively constant 0,
production, a linear regression was performed over the 30 to 90 minute
interval. Moticably lower slopes indicate a lower photosynthetic rate
for grazed plants. Statistically, the difference between grazed (x -
34.05 ul 09 / g : min, S.D. - 4.02) and ungrazed (50.51 ul 02 / g : min,
S.D. - 1.96) blades is significant (student "T"-test, 0.05 p 0.02).
DISCUSSION
The distribution data in figure 1 suggests that environmental
conditions such as wave intensity and exposure to desiccation piay an
important role in determining the overall body size of Notoacmea paleacea.
As environmental strains increase, N. paleacea size decreases significantly.
The strong wave action at West Beach could be either selectively destroying
larger N. paleacea by selecting against increased drag (increasing size),
or acting against the whole population simply by limiting the average age.
Decreased size at Pebble Beach could be a function of decreased
opportunity grazing activity or some metabolic burden limiting growth,
or again, the hostile environment might simply be lowering the probability
of survivingto reach larger sizes.
