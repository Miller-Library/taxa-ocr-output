FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. The relation of length and height of 3 populations of Notoacmea
paleacea to increasing levels of exposure. West Beach exposure is
greater than Stillwater Cove exposure is greater than Bird Rock Channe!
exposure.
Figure 2. Residency periods of individual M. paleacea on marked P, tor
blades over a seven day period.
Figure 3. Lengths of grazed areas on Phyllospadix torrevi blades for
individual M. paleacea over a three day period.
Figure 4. Photosynthetic activity graphed against time in minutes for
grazed and ungrazed blades of P. torrevi.
