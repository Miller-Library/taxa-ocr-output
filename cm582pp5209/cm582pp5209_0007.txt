N. paleacea on P. torreyi
That 4 of 12 Notoacmea paleacea (25%) died in the consumption
rate study is probably the result of injuries inflicted during the
transfer process from field to lab Phyllospadix torrevi. Considering a
chance of injury to the surviving N. paleacea, it seems justifiable to
interpret figure 3 by considering day three alone rather than all three
days in determining a mean consumption rate. Day three rates have both
a greater mean (consumed length per day of 38.63 mm compared to 24.42 mm)
and a lower standard deviation (14.45 compared to 19.69). By the third
day, N. paleacea seems to be relatively stable on the lab blades. From
third day data, N. paleacea consumes approximately 1/50 of its own body
weight per day in dry weight of P. torreyi epidermal cells. More
significantly, over a 5.76 day period (mean residency period) this amounts
to a grazing length of 220 mm.
The majority of Phyllospadix torrevi chlorophyl is contained within
the epidermal cell layer. Grazing by Notoacmea paleacea upon the epidermal
cells would be expected to lower photosynthetic capacity. Photorespirometer
results verify this conclusion. Oxygen production is over 30% lower in
grazed blades, indication significantly reduced photosynthetic capacities.
Overgrazing could have a devastating effect on plant growth with such
high rates of photosynthetic loss.
The discovery of xylem cells in gut samples indicates that Notoacmea
paleacea does at least some grazing much deeper than was previously recorded
(Barbour, 1979; Fishlyn, 1980). Grazing deeper than -the epidermal cell
layer should seriously weaken the blade; however, this weakening was not
observed. Deep grazing then probably does not occur often or for long
stretches. In any case, deeper grazing would surely amplify the risks
involved in overgrazing.
Overgrazing certainly threatens the stability of the limpet - surfgrass
