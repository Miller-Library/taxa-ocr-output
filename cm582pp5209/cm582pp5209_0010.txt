ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I wish to extend special thanks to my advisor CHUCK BAXTER for his
patience and quidance, to Dr. Isabella Abbott for the trifle and help
in analyzing limpet guts, to Robin Burnett for his suggestions on
statistical analysis, and to the rest of the Hopkins staff, and fellow
students for making the quarter so enjoyable. I can't imagine spending
spring anywhere else.
