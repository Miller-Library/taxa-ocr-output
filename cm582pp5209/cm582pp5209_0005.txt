Il. paleacea on P. torrey
Gansel, J. A.
ungrazed plant (0.0412 g) gives a value of 0.044 mg per mm of P. torreyi
grazed. Calculations show that 24.42 mm of blade grazed per day corresponds
to a consumption rate of about 1 mg of blade per day or considering the
last day alone, 1.7 mg of blade grazed per day. This gain corresponds to
approximately 1/50 of the wet body weight of an average sized N. paleacea
(8.1 mm, 0.083 g).
Gut samples were analyzed from freshly collected Notoacmea paleacea.
Dissections involved removal of the dorsal half of the shell including
the apex. After the stomach was located and slit open, its content was
removed and transfered to a slide, where it was spread, and finally
mounted in a glucose solution for examination under the compound microscope.
In addition to gut analyses, thin slice cross sections of Phyllospadix
torrevi grazed portions were also mounted and examined under the compound
microscope.
The mounted Phyllospadix torreyi cross sections revealed grazing of
the outer epidermal layer with little or no damage to inner mesophyl
layers. Viewed dorsally and anterior, the stomach was located just to the
right and below the intestine. Its contents were dark green with a few
scattered reflective grains intermixed. Under the compound microscope,
the majority of the stomach contents (approximately 85%) consisted of
P. torreyi cortical cell fragments best characterized by parallel rows of
single layered cells. Some of these fragments still contained chloroplasts.
Far less common (approximately 102), were the two diatom species found.
Finally, in small amounts, fragmented xylem cells were observed. These
cells were identified by the existence of accompanying pit cells. l
The effects of grazing on the photosynthetic rate of Phyllospadix
torreyi were measured on a Gilson respirometer (IGRP-14). Paired samples
composed of equal lengths of grazed and ungrazed P. torreyi were measured
