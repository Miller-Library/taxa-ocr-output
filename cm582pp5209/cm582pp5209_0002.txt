I. paleacea on P. torreyi
Notoacmea paleacea and Phyllospadix torreyi. N. paleacea grazes on the
chlorophyl containing epidermal cell layer of the plant, presumably
lowering the photosynthetic capacity and decreasing blade strength. In
the field, this should result in lessened blade growth rates and decreased
resistance to blade breakage. Aggressive feeding by N. paleacea could
seriously suppress P. torreyi populations. That N. paleacea does not
destroy the P. torreyi populations seems to suggest that some mechanism
exists to control N. paleacea grazing behavior.
Contained within are the results of a study on the symbiotic
relationship between Notoacmea paleacea and Phyllospadix torreyi. Along
with a distribution relating N. paleacea body size to exposure, this paper
examines residency rates on P. torreyi, gut analyses, rates of blade
consumption, and the effects of grazing on photosynthetic capacities of
P. torreyi
METHODS AND RESULTS
Field Studies
To determine a distribution based on degree of exposure to wave
turbulence and desiccation, Notoacmea paleacea were collected from three
sites on the Monterey Peninsula. In order of increasing exposure these
sites include: Bird Rock Channel - Hopkins Marine Station, Stillwater
Cove - Pebble Beach, and West Beach - II.M.S.
Bird Rock Channel refers to the sand and rock bottomed channel
running between Bird Rock and shore. At low minus tides this channel
transforms into a large tide pool with the majority of P. torreyi blades
remaining submerged. At high tide, the area is totally submerged but
strong wave action is broken up by the offshore reef.
Stillwater Cove lies behind a barrier of offshore rocks which create
