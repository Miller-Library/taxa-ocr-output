Introduction:
Considering the growing concern over mercury
levels in the marine environment, it is important to be
able to readily analyze for mercury compounds in marine
organisms. Several methods have been reported for the
extraction and detection of methylmercury; the most pre¬
valent and toxic mercury compound found in fish. This
study was initiated to compare two extraction technigues
and other related procedures for the removal and detection
of methylmercury in marine organisms.
Methods and Materials:
Standard Solutions:
Methylmercury chloride was obtained from MC/B
Manufacturing Chemists of Norwood, Ohio, and serially
diluted in pesticide quality benzene. No deterioration
of standards was detected over the five week period but
it is suggested that the most dilute solution be remade
from more concentrated solutions periodically. Standard
solutions of 500, 5, and 0.5 ng/ul (ug/ml) were used in
these experiments.
Standard curves:
Using injections of from 1 to 7 ul of standard so¬
lutions peak heights or peak weights were plotted against
nanograms injected to obtain standard curves (see Fig. 1).
Unknown samples were then weighed or measured to determine
ng/ul in the unknown (see Fig. 1).
