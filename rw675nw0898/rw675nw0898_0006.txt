of the preceding column was 2.0 ng. On this column it
was found that peak area for methylmercury does not vary
with temperature. This would suggest that there is no
breakdown at high temperatures.
In conclusion, it was found that a polar coating
(carbowax 20M) in narrow columns at high temperatures
give the most desirable results.
Extractions:
Two procedures were used to extract methylmercury
from fish muscle.
Lafavor Extraction: The first procedure developed
by Dr. Herb Lafavor of the Berkeley Food and Drug Laboratory
(1), utilized sample weights which yielded 0.2 to 3.0 ug
depending upon column sensitivity. Samples were homogenized
with 20-30 ml of acetone, placed in a stoppered 50 ml centriÂ¬
fuge tube and run at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes. The acetone
was then decanted and the sample shaken with another 30 ml
portion of acetone after breaking the cake with a spatula,
The sample was then centrifuged at 2000 ppm for 15 minutes
and the process repeated one more time. Although "nanograde"
acetone is suggested, reagent grade acetone was used without
pparent effects. After decanting the third time, the sample
was dried by blowing a filtered airstream (run through GLC
gas filter) across the broken up cake in the centrifuge
tube. Five ml of pesticide grade benzene and 10-20 ml of
