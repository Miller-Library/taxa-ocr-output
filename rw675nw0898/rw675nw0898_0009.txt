only a nitrogen airstream to evaporate the benzene. This
latter method then would be easiest and most efficient if
the column sensitivity is insufficient. However, further
tests would be need to determine percentage loss versus
original concentration.
Discussion:
Both the Westoo and Lafavor extraction procedures
were employed to test Bonita muscle samples with known
mercury concentrations (0.33 to 0.37 ppm) (5). Using the
latter method, 100% of the mercury in a 10 gram sample
was found to be in the form of methylmercury. Using the
former, two samples were found to contain 85 and 91%
methylmercury concentrations. Since the Lafavor extrac¬
tion is shorter, less complicated, and possibly more ef¬
ficient than the Westöö method it is recommended for
analysis of fish samples.
A 40 gram (dry weight) sample of macrocystis was
also tested. The Lafavor extraction was inadequate for
removing pigments before the benzene extraction. Thus
the cysteine method was used but had to be used twice for
sufficient cleanup. Of the 2 ug of total mercury present
(6) in the macrocystis sample none was shown to be in the
form of methylmercury.
