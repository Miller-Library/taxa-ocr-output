A SURVEY OF THE METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF
METHYLMERCURY IN FISH AND PLANT MATERIAL
by
Jerrold R. Darm
Abstract
Five columns, two extraction procedures, and
three cleanup methods were tested for efficiency in
the detection and isolation of methylmercury in both
fish and plant material. A 1/8" x 6' stainless steel
column packed with chromasorb W (80-100 mesh) on carbo¬
wax 20 M was used in the final measurements. Between
85 and 100% of the mercury in Bonita samples was me¬
thylated. No methylmercury was found in macrocystis.
