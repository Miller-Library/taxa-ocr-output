3N HCI which had been washed in benzene were then added,
The benzene should be added first to prevent bubbling.
The solution was shaken vigorously for 3-5 minutes and
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes. The benzene
layer was then pipetted off and two more 5 ml aliguots
were added and extracted using the same procedure. All
three aliquots were placed in the same vial and submitted
to gas chromatography.
Westoo Extraction (4): Westöö's latest extraction
procedure was used (1968). The glassware was washed with
IN ammonium hydroxide, distilled water, and finally with
ethyl alcohol. Samples were homogenized with 55 ml of
distilled water and poured into a 250 ml centrifuge flask,
Fourteen ml of Hel and 70 ml of pesticide grade benzene
were added. The mixture was stoppered, shaken vigorously
for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 30 minutes.
Fifty ml of the benzene layer were pipetted off the top
and placed in a separatory funnel. The methylmercury was
then extracted with two 5 ml aliquots of 1% cysteine acetate
solution. This solution is made by dissolving 1.00 gram
of cysteine hydrochloride, 0.775 gram of sodium acetate
and 12.5 grams of anhydrous sodium sulphate in water and
made up to 100 ml (3). Finally, the 10 ml of cysteine
solution were acidified with 5.5 ml of 6N HCl and extracted
with 10 ml of benzene. This is dried with anhydrous sodium
sulphate using a micropipette stoppered with silvanized
galvanized wool and submitted to liquid gas chromatography.
