Cleanup Procedures:
Several cleanup procedures were tested including
elution through silica gel and florisil columns packed in
micropipettes. The former method was both unsatisfactory
for removing plant pigments and for allowing passage of
methylmercury. The florisil column however removed plant
pigments while allowing two-thirds of the methylmercury in
a 10 ml sample of 0.5 ug/ul sample to pass through. A
third method which proved most satisfactory for recovery
was to extract the solution twice with 1% cysteine acetate
solution. Ten ml of this solution were sufficient to
transfer 100% of the methylmercury from 10 ml of a 2.0
ug/ml standard solution into a "clean" benzene solution.
These cleanup procedures were necessary for preparing ex¬
tractions of mixed plant and animal tissue.
Concentration Procedures:
In all cases, the concentration of standard solutions
of methylmercury in benzene yielded loss of a certain amount
of methylmercury. However, some were more efficient than
others. Aspiration and heating while exposed to a nitrogen
airstream were the least efficient procedures since approxi¬
mately one-half of the methylmercury was lost in 20-fold
concentration tests. Only one-third of the methylmercury
was lost using a reflux device on a steambath and the same
amount was vaporized in a 30-fold concentration test using
