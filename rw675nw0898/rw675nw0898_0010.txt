In another experiment ten grams of Perch intestinal
content were measured for methylmercury content and none
was found. Then to test for the possible methylation of
inorganic mercury (7) 50 parts per million of HgCl, were
added to 10 grams of gut content and incubated for two
weeks. However no methylmercury was found in the incubated
sample.
In conclusion then the Lafavor extraction seems to
be superior for fish samples yet inadequate when plant
pigments are present while the Westöö procedure is suffi¬
cient for the latter case.
