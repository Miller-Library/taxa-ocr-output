Columns:
All the columns were tested on the Beckman GCA gas
liguid chromatograph. The first column to be tested was
a pesticide column containing a 1:1 mixed bed of 5% DC200
and 6% Ofl on chromosorb W (80-100 mesh) packed in a 6
x 1/4" pyrex tube. Operating at 200°C this column gave
insufficient separation of peaks as shown in Figure 2.
A more polar coating of 5% 1,4 Butanediol succinate on
chromasorb W (80-100 mesh) packed in a 6' x 1/8" stainless
steel column was used in the next trial. However, even at
column temperatures of as low as 140°C severe "tailing"
and incomplete separations of the benzene and methylmercury
peaks were observed.
The final three columns were packed with 5% carbowax
20M on chromasorb W (80-100 mesh) since this compound was
the most polar coating available to us. The first column
was a 6' x 1/4" glass tube. At a column temperature of
140°C this column gave good separation but poor sensitivity.
If the temperature had been increased both the peak shape
and sensitivity might have been improved but this was not
tested. The next column tested was 4' x 1/8" and was packed
with the same material. It yielded excellent peak shapes
and fair sensitivity at elevated temperatures (i.e. 175°c).
The final column was of stainless steel 6' x 1/8" and when
operated at a column temperature of 200°C it yielded good
separation and excellent sensitivity. The limit of detec¬
tion was approximately 0.5 ng, while the limit of detection
