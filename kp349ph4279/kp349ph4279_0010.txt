laying of the eggs, survived as long as 2 or 3 days more than females with
external egg masses or empty ovaries. Perhaps at least some of the lipid
soluble toxicants are deposited in the developing eggs, resulting iu a
decrease in the internal effective concentration of these toxicants in the
particular female. An investigation of the viability of larval forms born
to these females should prove interesting as a subject for further investigation.
Coroner noted a decrease in clutch size in the copepod Eurytemora affinis
following exposure to oil (Coroner, 1975). Therefore, there may be further
effects on fertility.
The attempts at simulation of some tidepool conditions in toxicity
titrations illustrate some of the deficiencies of the usual laboratory assays
as measures of toxicity in the natural environment. Other effects, such as
a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency in tidepools where surface is coated
with oil may result in further deleterious effects.
Although a fresh spill occuring near the shore seems to pose the most
immediate threat to the high tidepool environment and its inhabitants, the
effect of washed, weathered oil on Tigriopus californicus remains far from
negligible.
ACKNOVLEDGEMENT
I would like to extend my appreciation to the faculty and students of
the 175H class at Hopkins Marine station, and in particular to Dr. John
Phillips whose editing and suggestions were enormously useful. Thanks also
to Moss Landing Marine Labs for the sample of Kuwait Crude oil. Finally,
a special word of thanks to Gillian Kendall, without whom this quarter would
not have been quite the same.
