of 1.89, indicating a significant potency difference in the two conditions.
Oxygen levels in both controls and experimental bottles were less than 10%
of saturation when the assay was terminated. There were no mortalities in
the controls as the animals managed to obtain oxygen by hovering near the
surface. Although animals behaved similarly in the bottles containing
oil, the oil film may have inhibited respiration at the surface. The
degree to which this enhancement of oil toxicity is due to interference
with oxygen diffusion is difficult to evaluate. The aqueous phase removed
from the assays was tested and proved not to be toxic to T. californicus
after a period of aeration.
DISCUSSION
It is known that the most soluble components of crude oil are the
short chain alkanes and light aromatics (Anderson, et al, 1974) Consequently
it appears that these seawater soluble compounds are highly toxic to T.
californicus. The steeper slope of the dose effect curve of the soluble
fraction may be an indication of the acute toxicity of the preparation.
Immediate sublethal effects include a marked decrease in the activity of
T. californicus. The narcotic effect of crude oil, in particular of the
soluble fraction has been mentioned before (Goldacre, 1968). Other workers
have identified soluble material as the acutely toxic fraction of oil, with
benzenes and napthalenes being singled out as particularly toxic to marine
invertebrates (Anderson, 1974; Blumer, 1970; Boylan, 1971; Ottaway, 1971;
Shelton, 1971).
It is probable that the large dilution volumes present in the open
ocean, combined with the relatively low solubility of these hydrocarbon
compounds may result in negligible concentrations of soluble aromatics
other organics in the ocean. The situation in the high tidepool, however,
