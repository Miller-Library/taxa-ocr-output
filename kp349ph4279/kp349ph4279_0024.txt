Figure 6. Comparison of the susceptibilities of male and female
adults of the species Tigriopus californicus to whole Kuwait Crude Oil.
Open and closed squares represent two separate assays performed on male
T. californicus and yield an LD of .092 grams/liter with 95% confidence
limits of .139 and .061. Open and closed squares represent two separate
toxicity assays using female T. californicus. LD for females is .195
grams/liter, with 95% confidence limits of .309 and .123.
