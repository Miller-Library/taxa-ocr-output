INTRODUCTION
A considerable body of information dealing with both field and laboratory
toxicity of oil and petroleum products to marine organisms has been generated
in the last decade (see Moore, 1973). Most of this work has tended to focus
on economically important species such as oysters or clams. Until recently,
little was known about the impact of oil pollution on representative copepods.
Mironov (1968, 1969) examined the response of Black Sea copepods to crude
cil, and reports impact of 1.0 ppm of crude oil on the survival of copepods.
More recent work by Kontgiannis and Barnett (1973,1975) studied the toxicity
of crude oil and crude oil fractions on Tigriopus californicus, concluding
that effects were due to both the blocking of oxygen transport across the
air-water interface and to toxic materials present in the oil.
The present study attempts to examine the toxic effect of Kuwait Crude
oil on a high tidepool organism, Tigriopus californicus. Whole fresh oil as well
as weathered oil were compared for toxicity. Sea water soluble and less
sea water soluble fractions of these materials were also studied. An attempt
at a closer simulation of tidepool conditions in toxicity tests is presented,
as well as an investigation of differential susceptibility of males and females
in the copepod population.
