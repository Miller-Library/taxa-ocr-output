Figure 7. Comparison of the Log Dose vs. Percent Mortality plots
of washed Kuwait Crude Oil to T. californicus as assayed in a simulated
tidepool condition containing algae and sand,and containing only seawater.
Open and closed circles represent two separate assays in only seawater.
Squares represent toxicity titration performed in a simulated tidepool
situation. The LD for washed Kuwait Oil assayed in seawater is.405
grams/liter, with 95% confidence limits of .650 and .252. The LD., obtained
in the tidepool simulation is .080 grams/liter, with 958 confidence limits of
.125 and .051.
