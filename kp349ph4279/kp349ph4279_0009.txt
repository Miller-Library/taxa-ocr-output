may be considerably more critical, given that the smaller volumes of water
available for dilution may enable the levels of solubilized hydrocarbons in
the water column to reach lethal concentrations.
Whole Kuwait also exhibited considerable toxicity to T. californicus.
This whole oil is the source of the soluble hydrocarbons accounting for the
toxicity of the soluble fraction. However, the rate of diffusion of
aromatics and short chain saturates from a surface layer of oil is probably
relatively slow and results in low concentrations of solubilized hydrocarbons.
The uptake by T. californicus of any of the soluble components may result
in further release of substances from the oil film.
Washed Kuwait, although treated in a manner that removes all or most
of the readily soluble materials from crude oil, nevertheless exhibits toxicity
to T. californicus and probably indicates residual toxic materials not
removed by the wash procedure.
In attempting to ascertain the reasons for the toxicity of Whole
weathered oil, it should be kept in mind that the same short chain alkanes
and light aromatics that are seawater soluble are the most volatile
hydrocarbons present (Lockwood, 1976). The 40 day weathering period left
a residue that has been altered by volatilization, dissolution, microbial
action and autooxidation (Moore,1973 ; Butler, 1974). The first two processes,
volatilization and dissolution,remove the fraction of oil with boiling points
below. 250° C, probably within a matter of hours (Moore, 1973). Further loss
of toxicity may result from the shortening of certain alkane chains by auto¬
oxidation or microbial action, and consequently increase solubility and
volatility.
In addition to the differential susceptibility of males and females to
Kuwait Crude oil, it was noted that among the females, those with darkened
ovaries and oviducts,indicating the presence of ripe eggs but preceeding the
