RESULTS
Figures 1,2,3,4 and 5 show the lethal effect of various fractions
for Tigriopus californicus. Dose is shown in grams/liter of water vs. 9
mortality. Table 1 summarizes the information obtained from the previous
plots. The LDgo's, along with their 95 confidence limits show the varying
toxicities of the different fractions. Table 1 shows that the different
fraction used in this study exhibit different toxicities for T. californicus.
Apparent differences in the toxicity of the fractions point to the necessity
of a careful definition of the history of the oil when describing its
toxicity.
The soluble fraction, a seawater extract of the most water soluble components
of Kuwait Crude oil shows the highest toxicity to the copepod T. californicus.
It should be mentioned that the volume of soluble fraction that was administered
to the copepods was translated into a weight dose by using Anderson's
estimate of the solubility of Kuwait Crude oil in seawater (Anderson, et al,
1974). Although the technique used here differs substantially from the one
described by Anderson, the figure of 21.68 ppm of oil in solution was
considered the best available estimate of the solubility of this oil in seaÂ¬
water.
Where the toxicant formed a surface film, oxygen determinations were
carried out at the end of the assays, showing no noticeable decrease in the
dissolved oxygen in experimental vessels; except a decrease to 40% of
saturation at the high doses of washed oil. Oxygen levels of as little as
203 saturation have been found to have little effect in survival of T.
californicus (Fahey, 1977).

the potency ratio as a quantitative measure. The factor fpp and the 95%
