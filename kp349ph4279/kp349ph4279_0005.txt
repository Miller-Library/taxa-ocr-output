remained in suspension. This soluble fraction was tested immediately after
preparation.
The weathered oil was prepared by placing 100 ml. of Whole Kuwait cil
with 400 ml. of seawater in a large beaker that was then placed outdoors,
in full sunlight for 40 days. The residue was more viscous than the original
oil. Water was removed from the beaker as completely as was possible.
The washed weathered oil was obtained using the washing procedure
described above.
With the exception of the soluble fraction (administered by volume).
all other fractions were administered by weight and carefully placed on
the surface of the sea water containing the test animals. All tests were
carried out in 30 ml. glass stoppered bottles, with a final water volume
of 25 ml.
Animals were examined at regular intervals to record the number of deaths,
Any animal that did not respond to shaking was considered dead.
Oxygen determinations were carried out using the Winkler technique
(Strickland and Parsons, 1965).
The results of toxicity titrationswere analyzed using the approximate
probit method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (Litchfield and Wilcoxon, 1949).
This method provides a factor f LD.. The product and quotient of this
factor with the LD yields 958 confidence limits for the LD5. Potency
ratios, P.R., may be obtained as a comparison between toxicants. The factor
Ipg must be less than P.R. for there to be a significant difference between
EDgo's.
Generally, log-dose effect plots were drawn using the results of two
independent toxicity titrations.The assays were terminated when no further
mortality was noted.
In all cases, control mortalities over the prescribed time period,
