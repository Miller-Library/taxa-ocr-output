confidence limits for Potency Ratios are also presented.
The potency ratio of Whole Kuwait vs. Washed Kuwait is a measure of
the important loss of toxicity that occurs upon removal of the seawater
soluble fraction. The weathering of crude oil results in an almost seven
fold reduction in its toxicity to T. californicus. The potency ratio of
Washed Kuwait vs. weathered oil indicates that weathering is the more
effective mechanism for the reduction of toxic constituents. Subsequent
washing of the weathered oil does not yield a significantly less toxic
material.
A comparison of the susceptibility of adult male and female T. californicus
to Whole Kuwait Crude oil yielded the results presented in figure 6. Females
with external egg masses were excluded from the female test population. The
LDgo for females was .195 grams/liter, with 95% confidence limits of .123 and
.309. The LDg for males was .092 grams/liter with 95 confidence limits of
.Obl and .139. A comparison provided a potency ratio of 2.12 and an fpp
of 1.84, indicating a significant difference in the susceptibility of the
sexes. Females with internal eggs in darkened ovaries were observed to
survive 2-3 days longer than females with external egg masses or females
with empty ovaries.
A closer simulation of high tidepool conditions was attempted by conÂ¬
ducting the toxicity titrations in the presence of sand and naturally
occuring drift algae. Approximately 7.5 mm. of washed sand were used to
cover approximately 2 grams of fresh Macrocystis pyrifera in the bottcm of
assay bottles. Washed oil was added and the toxicity compared to that obtained
in assays lacking sand and algae. Figure 7 presents the results. The
toxicity was greater under the simulating conditions. Without sand and algae,
the LD was .405 grams/liter with 958 confidence limits of .252 and .650.
In the simulations the LD was .080 grams/liter with 958 confidence limits
A comparison gave a potency ratio of 5.06 and an fy
of .051 and .12
