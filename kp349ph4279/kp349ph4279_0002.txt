ABSTRACT
The toxicity of several preparations obtained from Kuwait Crude oil
to Tigriopus californicus was investigated. Whole oil, sea water extracted
whole oil, the seawater extract, and similar materials obtained from oil
weathered for 40 days were compared. The LDg's may be ranked as follows;
The most toxic preparation was the seawater extract, followed by Whole Kuwait
oil, washed Kuwait oil, weathered oil and washed weathered oil, in order
of decreasing toxicity. Males were found to be twice as susceptible as females
to the whole oil preparation. Assays conducted in an attempted simulation of
the tidepool environment revealed higher toxicities than were cbtained
under more traditional methods of assay.
