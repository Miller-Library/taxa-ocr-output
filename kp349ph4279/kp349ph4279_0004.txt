METHODS AND MATERIALS

T. californicus used in this study were collected from a high tidepool
located at Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, California. Animals were kept
in two large bowls of filtered seawater at room temperature. Water was
changed every two days. The diet supplied to the animals was Tetramin fish
food (Telia Werke, West Germany). Prior to any experiment, a rundown sample
of T. californicus was taken from the aquarium and placed under a dissecting
scope for removal of copulating pairs and larvae, along with dead and moribund
specimens. Ten animals were subjected to each dose of the test materials.
The fractions of oil used in this study are all derived from an original
one gallon sample of American Petroleum Institute Reference Kuwait Crude,
referred to in this paper as Whole Kuwait. This sample was generously proÂ¬
vided by Dr. John Martin of Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in Moss Landing,
California.
The Washed Kuwait fraction was prepared by mixing one part of Whole
Kuwait with three parts of fresh filtered seawater. The mixing was done
manually in a separating funnel by shaking vigorously for five minutes.
Separation was then allowed to proceed for approximately 90 minutes before
water was drained from the funnel. The process was repeated five times with
fresh filtered seawater. The water extracted after the fifth wash showed
no toxicity to Tigriopus c. over a 96 hour test period.
The soluble fraction of Kuwait Crude oil was obtained by extracting
one part of oil with two parts of seawater in a separating funnel, mixed
vigorously by hand for five minutes. The mixture was allowed to stand for
two hours and was then mixed again. This process was repeated a third time,
The mixture was then allowed to separate for approximately 12 hours before
the water was removed and filtered through Whatman l filter paper (Whatman
Manufacturers, England) to remove any microparticles of oil that might have
