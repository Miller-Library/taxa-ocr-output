andard deviations, close to the mean values
The apparent rates of division for each tissue are shown
in Table 3 and Figure 3. Statistically, the mean tentacle
value is distinctly lowest and the mean upper
column value
is distinctly highest (student's T test, p K.05). The mese
teries, oral disc, and middle column have very similar mear
division rates.
Zooxanthellae were found to have 2.5x10 mg of chlo
yll-a per algal cell. In addition, 2.15mg of pheophytin-a
was found in the same population which contained approximately
5210
zooxanthellae. Cultured zooxanthellae were determined
37.9x10 mg of protein per algal cell.

Observations were made during the course of this inves
ation regarding the extrusion of zooxanthellae from the
anemone. Muscatine (1974) reports periodic extrusion of
ucus containing zooxanthellae from the mouth. Possible
urces for these zooxanthellae are the mesenteries, as rep
Taylor (1968), and the large mass of zooxanthellae
bserved in the lumen of the tentacles.
