The investigation of the benefits received by the host
anemone in its symbiotic relationship with the zooxanthellae,
intracellular and intercellular dinoflagellates, has been
limited to the transfer of organic compounds between the
anemone and viable populations of the algae. Trench (1971
demonstrated that zooxanthellae in vitro release photosyn-
thetically fixed 'C to the host tissue in the form of glycerol
alanine, glucose, and organic acids, without lysis of the alga
1968) and ammonia (Kawaguti, 195
cells. Phosphate (von Holt,
ransfer in corals have also been studied.
It is known (Huscatine, 1974) that anemones sustain their
zooxanthellae in a steady-state, with new cells being produced
and degenerate cells being extruded in the mucus (Taylor, 1968)
These degenerate cells have enormous potential for the anemone
a source of organic and inorganic nutrients. Tonge (1975)
reports that the giant clam Tridacna gigas transports its
symbiotic algae from the sunlight to the inner tissues wher
they become senescent. The senile algae then enter the blood
stream where they are digested, releasing their nutritional
benefit to the host.
This paper will investigate the possibilit
f a similar behavior between the sea anemone Anthopleur
xanthogrammica and its zooxanthellae.
According to Yonge (1930), coelenterates do not diges
their algal symbionts, so the investigation for farming
behavior must consider possible nutrients derived from degen-
