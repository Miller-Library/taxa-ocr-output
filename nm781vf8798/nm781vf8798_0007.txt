divide in the tissue and are accumulated there until
sin
xtrusion takes place directly from that tissue. The differen
ial division rates are thereby caused by differential accum-
ulation rates. Alternatively, the senescent zooxanthellae
may be constantly transported from the upper column, middle
column, and oral disc to the tentacles and mesenteries for
legeneration and extrusion.
In either case, the lack of variation
suggests that the movement and extrusion is a continual proces
the most part, and any periodic extrusion involves an
amount of zooxanthellae which does not significantly affec
rom which periodie
the division rates. The most likely area
extrusion could take place without affecting the divisi
rate is the tentacles.
The mean pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios show
negatite correlation with the division rates, as shown in
This is to be expected, as a population with
igure 4.
igh amount of senescent zooxanthellae would show a low
division rate and a high amount of degenerate cells, hence
a high pheophytin concentration. Furthermore, the negative
correlation indicates that the pheophytin-a present in the
Issues is not caused by a continual leakage from the algal
cells, which would occur in the case of a turnover of chlord
phyll in those cells.
There is an apparent contradiction, though, because th
pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios show wide variances which
e not reflected in the division rates.
