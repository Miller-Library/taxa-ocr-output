Th
zooxanthellae can be estimated to release as much as 15. me
f protein per milligram of pheophytin-a to the anemone.
he basis of the apparent accumulation of pheophytin-a, it
seems very possible that the anemone is receiving benefi
rom at least some of these algal products.
At the beginning of this investigation, I defined farm
behavior as involving the transportation of zooxanthellae
within the anemone plus some benefit to the anemone from
he digested or degenerate zooxanthellae. On the basis o
idence, the exploration of zooxanthellae transport coi
ident with the algal
life cycle is inconclusive, although the
lifferer
ial division rates suggest the possibility of some
such movement. On the subject of benefit to th√© anemone;
eems fairly definite that pheophytin-a and some other
chloroplastic materials are being released to the anemone
Whether the anemone is using these products is unknown.
the pheophytin is being accumulated in the tissues as the
sults suggest, then it would seem likely that the anemone
in fact, using the products of degeneration. There i
ertainly a need for more work in this area to determine
