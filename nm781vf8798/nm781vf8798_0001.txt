Different areas of anemone were found to have differen
relative amounts of chlorophyll-a, and differential apparent
division rates of zooxanthellae.
Pheophytin-a was used as an
assay of compounds released to anemone tissue due to zooxan-
thellae degeneration. Pheophytin appears to be periodical
accumulated in the anemone tissue, indicating a possible use
chloroplastic material from lysed cells as a nutritiona
source
