ATERIALS AED METIC
1 anemones were collected intertidally from Hopkins
larine Station. In the field,
were oriented such that
they
each received approximately the same amount oi
sunlight, and
all except anemone fi were collected at about 9:00 A.M. of the
day
they were to be assayed. Anemone
remained in an aquar
ium with less than normal light for one week befor-
