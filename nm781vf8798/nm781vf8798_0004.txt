Cultured zooxanthellae were used to determine the protein
content of a single algal cell. The zooxanthellae were
collected by centrifugation of homogenized anemone tissue
and cultured in enriched seawater medium. Protein determin-
ation was performed by the Lowry method (1951). Population
counts of the cultures were made with a hemocytometer.
Chlorophyll determination of a zooxanthellae population
was performed by acetone extraction, after collecting the alga-
centrifugation of anemone homogenate.
They were washed
in sterile seawater and recentrifuged five times.
Populati
counts were again made in a hemocytometer.
The amounts of chlorophyll-a vary greatly between different
areas of the anemone. The results of the chlorophyll assay
are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. Tentacles, mesenteries
and middle column have statistically distinct mean relative
values (student's T test, p C.05), while the oral disc an
apper column are nearly equal.
Pheophytin-a is magnesium-free chlorophyll-a. It is the
form in which chlorophyll is released from algal cells. The
pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios are in Table 2 and Figure
can be seen to exhibit a wide range of values, even when
converted to relative terms. The oral disc shows a rather
tight distribution, while all other tissue parts have larg
