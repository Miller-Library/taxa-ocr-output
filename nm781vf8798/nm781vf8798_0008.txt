determined instead by an accumulation of the pheophytin-a
itself which has been released from
degenerating zooxanthellae,
the fluctuations would have no effect upon the apparent division
rates. With the small number of trials, it is possible that
luctuations in the apparent division rates do occur, but
were not observed in my five anemones. It does seem likely
though, that if the fluctuations are present, they would hav
become visible in at least one tissue part of one anemone,
simply on the basis of the wide occurrence of variance in th
pheophytin-a/ chlorophyll-a ratios.
The results indicate
therefore, that a high number of senescent cells creates:
latively high amount of pheophytin. But whereas the senes
entand degenerate zooxanthellae are continually
extruded,
causing the division rates to remain constant, the pheophytir
accumulated in the tissue and extruded periodically.
The pheophytin-a which is released by the degeneratin,
gal cells provides a good indication of other compounds
which are also released to the anemone tissue for possibl
Bonner (1950) reports that chlorophyll is stable in t
hloroplasts only when in association with other chloroplastie
materials, such as chloroplastic proteins. When the alga
legenerates, the chloroplast is the first organelle to lyse
ing its contents to the anemone. Thus, an accumulatior
pheophytin-a could indicate an accumulation of other
mpounds which would be of more use to the anemone.
