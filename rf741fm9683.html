The activity of yellowfin tuna <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Thunnus albacares : Exact'>Thunnus albacares</span> in captivity was assayed
through observations of speed, distance travelled in a day, and tailbeat. Cytochrome
oxidase and myosin ATPase assays were conducted on red and white muscle tissues from
wild and captive yellowfin tuna to determine a relative level of these enzyme activities.
The speeds calculated for the captive tuna were found to be significantly less than speeds
found by tracking wild tuna, indicating that captivity may be reducing tuna activity. In
addition, the enzyme assays revealed that cytochrome oxidase activity in captive white
muscle tissue appears to be distinctly different than that in wild white muscle tissue, and
different isoforms of myosin ATPase may be expressed in captive red and white muscle
tissues than those in wild red and white muscle tissues.
Introduction
Yellowfin tuna have been maintained in captivity for 1.7 years at the Tuna
Research and Conservation Center (TRCC) at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University in Pacific Grove, CA. Three sudden deaths due to heart attack in March 1995
of these tuna prompted an investigation of the cause. Were the tuna exercising enough?
How had captivity affected their activity? Was their activity less than that of wild tuna?
The goal of this study was to quantify tuna swimming activity and compare it to the
available data on wild tuna swimming behavior.
Because tuna are ram ventilators, they must constantly swim to maintain a
continuous flow of oxygen over their gills. In the wild, their "tank" is the vast Pacific
Ocean, so tunas naturally have essentially no limitations on this swimming activity which
involves the red, or slow oxidative muscle. Wild tuna also consistently use their white, or
fast glycolytic, muscle to sprint for the purpose of catching prey and avoiding predators.
The ambient temperature of yellowfin tuna’s natural habitat ranges from 18-28°C.
Tracking studies indicate that they have a thermal preference for water temperatures
greater than 23°C (Holland, et al.).
Tuna kept in captivity at the TRCC are not only subjected to a limited tank size,
but are also hand fed frozen food and have no predators. The limitations imposed by
captive conditions may affect both aerobic and anaerobic swimming activity. In addition
the water temperature has been maintained at 20°C, a temperature that they would
experience in their natural habitat annually. Ambient temperature may also have an
affect on tuna activity.
Autopsies of tuna mortalities from the TRCC taken in March 1995 indicate that
they may be living the lifestyle of a "couch potato", eating too much and exercising too
little, as is evidenced by acumulation of lipid in their muscle. Histochemical assays were
used to test for differences between the muscle fiber types found in wild and captive tuna.
Captive tuna muscle tissue samples were taken from TRCC tuna kept in captivity for 9
months and a second population of tuna kept in the quarantine for 13 months. Muscle
fibers with a higher aerobic capacity contain more mitochondria and thus stain darker
when stained for cytochrome oxidase activity. Cytochrome oxidase catalyzes the transfer
of electrons to oxygen, the final electron acceptor in the electron transport and oxidative
phosphorylation chain of aerobic respiration. This process takes place in the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is the major source of ATP production in aerobic tissues
(Lehninger, 1982). Myosin ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to
adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, thereby providing the energy necessary
to initiate muscular contraction. The speed of muscle shortening is directly proportional
to the myosin ATPase activity present, which implies that the speed of contraction may
be determined from the level of ATPase activity. However, there are several examples in
which the biochemical and physiological properties of the muscle are not accurately
reflected by myosin ATPase activities, such as in the muscles of newborn animals which
stain intensely for ATPase although their ATPase activity is very low and their
contraction speed is slow. It is not possible to determine the locality of enzyme activity
in a cell from the distribution of the reaction product because inorganic phosphate
liberated in mitochondrial, myofibrillar, or sarcotubular ATPase activity selectively binds
to myofibrils (Guth, 1973). In addition, the intensity of ATPase staining does not
necessitate the level of enzyme activity due to differential inorganic phosphate binding
among various muscle fiber types (Guth, 1973). Assays for myosin ATPase activity
involve treating tissues with acidic or alkali buffers to destroy certain myosin ATPase
isoforms. Differential staining between similar tissues subjected to the same treatment
may indicate that there is a difference in the isoforms expressed in the given tissues
Materials and Methods
Tuna and Captive Conditions
The yellowfin tuna studied were located in two tanks at the TRCC. Tank 1 (TI) is
12.336 m (40 ft) in diameter, 3.084 m (10 ft) deep, and holds 336,891.7 L (89,000 gal) of
aerated seawater pH 7.9 kept at 20.5°C + 1 °C (70'F). Two pumps recirculate water into
the tank at 2271.18 L per minute (600 gpm) each and make-up water is pumped in at
302.8 L per minute (80 gpm) for a 74 minute turnover rate. Tank 3 (T3) is 9.252 m (30
ft) in diameter, 1.8054 m (6 ft) deep, and holds 109,773.7 L (29,000 gal) of seawater kept
at 20.5°C + 1 °C (70’F). 1514.12 L per minute (400 gpm) of recirculated water and
75.706 L per minute (20 gpm) of make-up water is pumped into T3 for a 74 minute
turnover rate. The water is pumped in at the surface edge and removed from a large drain
in the bottom center of the tank as well as from two small overflow drains at the surface
edge of each tank. This method of water recirculation creates a current in each tank with
a vortex in the center.
The velocity of the water in the tank was measured in each tank with a Marsh-
McBirney Model 511 electromagnetic velocity meter that ascertained the ion flow
(cm/sec) that passed a probe along x and y axes from which vector calculations could be
made. TI water velocity measurements were taken at 0.61m (2 ft), 1.65m (5.4 ft), 2.29m
(7.5 ft), 2.68m (8.8 ft), 3.6m (11.8 ft), 4.45m(14.6 ft), and 5.43m (17.8 ft) horizontally
from the edge of the tank at depths of 0.62m (2ft), 0.93m (3 ft), 1.54m (5 ft), 2.16m (7 ft),
and 2.78m (9 ft). T3 water velocity measurements were taken at 0.73 m (2.36 ft), 1.83 m
(5.93 ft), 3.08 m (10 ft), and 4.32 m (14.12 ft) horizontally from the edge of the tank at
depths of 0.61m (2 ft) and 1.54m (5 ft). Each tank is equipped with a plastic curtain 0.4
m (1.3 ft) from the edge of the tank that hangs from the water surface to the bottom of the
tank, designed to protect the fish from injury due to collisions with the wall of the tank.
T3 has a 1 m’ grid across the entire bottom surface of the tank and TI has a similar grid
only at the outer edge of the tank.
The tuna in TI were between 2 and 3 years old, have been in captivity for 1.7
years, and are approximately 1.11 m long. The tuna in T3 are between 1 and 2 years old,
have been in captivity for 9 months, and are approximately 0.7325 m long.
Quantifying Speed
A.
TI
An easily identifiable individual with a large scar on the right side of its face
(Scarface) was chosen from the school for observation.
When swimming with the current, the tuna in TI swim laps consistently. A pole
marked in O.Im increments was extended over the tank from its edge so that the position
of Scarface relative to the edge of the tank could be measured for each lap. Observations
were made from the catwalk above the tank. Positions at the beginning and end of each
lap were measured and averaged. This mean was subtracted from the tank radius, 6.096
m (20 ft), to obtain the average radius swam. The average radius that the school swam
was determined by measuring the position relative to the edge of the tank of the
innermost and outermost fish of the school at the beginning and end of each lap. The
average position of the school was calculated separately for the beginning and end of
each lap, and these calculations were averaged to determine the mean lap position, which
was subtracted from the tank radius to determine the average school radius swam. Lap
distance was calculated from lap radius using the equation: lap distance-2rr.
This method was also used to observe Scarface when the tuna were swimming
against the current. It was impossible to collect accurate school data against the current
due to a lack in quantifiable school behavior. When swimming against the current, the
tuna display a preference to swim through the vortex in the center of the tank rather than
swim in laps.
Lap time was measured for both Scarface and the school with the current and for
Scarface against the current with a stopwatch. Lap time began and ended when
Scarface’s rostrum passed under the pole and began and ended when the nose of the first
tuna in the school passed under the pole. Consecutive laps were timed for observation
periods ranging from 8 to 50 minutes in length. Lap observations were collected at all
hours of the day and night, though not in a consecutive 24 hour period.
Lap speed relative to the tank was calculated by dividing lap distance by lap time.
The speed relative to the water could then be calculated by subtracting the average water
velocity for observations taken when the tuna were travelling with the current and adding
the water velocity for observations against the current. Dividing this absolute speed by
the average body length (1.11 m) of the tuna yielded a speed calculation in body
lengths/sec (1/s).
B. T3
Because preliminary observations of tuna behavior in T3 indicated that they do
not consistently swim laps, it was necessary to quantify speed by a means other than lap
radius and lap time. The grid on the bottom of the tank was used to observe from the
catwalk above the tank the time required for a tuna to pass straight through a 3 m path
approximately 1.85 m (6 ft) from the edge. A 3 m distance was chosen because it was a
distance through which the tuna would often swim straight and observation was more
accurate than for a larger distance due to less diffractional distortion. The tuna in T3
were all approximately the same length, so observations were taken of any member of the
tank, save one which was obviously larger than the others. Time was taken with a stop
watch and began when the rostrum of an individual crossed a grid line and ended when
the rostrum of the same individual crossed a grid line 3m from the start position.
Observations were recorded only if the tuna travelled the 3 m in a straight line. Speed
relative to the tank was calculated by dividing 3m by the time required to travel 3m.
Speed relative to the water was found by subtracting (0.112 m/s), the velocity of the
water at 1.85 m (6 ft) from the edge, when the observations were taken travelling with the
current, and adding 0.112 m/s when the observations were taken against the current.
Dividing this absolute speed by the average body length (0.7325 m) of the tuna yielded a
speed calculation in body lengths/sec. The tuna were observed at all hours of the day and
night, though not in a consecutive 24 hour period.
Distance
The average speed (Is) throughout the day was calculated and multiplied by the
number of seconds in a day (24 hrs/day*60 min/hr'60sec/min) to yield the distance (1)
travelled in a day.
Tailbeats
Tailbeat frequency was determined in T3 by counting the number of times the
tuna beat its tail as it passed through 3m concurrent with the time/3m observations. A
full tailbeat was defined as a complete cycle when the tail returned to its starting position.
Tailbeats/sec were calculated for a constant distance of 3m.
Tailbeat in TI was not quantified. Due to limited grid area, it was difficult to
observe tailbeats over a constant distance.
Histolog
Cytochrome Oxidase and Myosin ATPase enzyme assays were performed on 8
um thick tissue cross sections of goldfish, wild tuna red muscle, wild tuna white muscle,
quarantine tuna red muscle, quarantine tuna white muscle, TRCC tuna red muscle, and
TRCC tuna red muscle mounted on the same slide.
The cytochrome oxidase assay was adapted from the protocol of Old and Johnson
(1988). The assay solution contained the following reagents mixed in order, kept on ice
and protected from light: 1 ml O.1M pH 7.6 phosphate buffer, 4 mM diaminobenzidine
and 100 uM cytochrome c. The control solution did not contain cytochrome c. Each
solution was applied to a slide of the seven tissues and incubated in a water bath at 35°C
for 30 minutes then dehydrated in an ethanol series and coverslipped with Permount.
The myosin ATPase assay was adapted from the protocol of Guth and Samaha
(1969). The acid preincubation medium contained 0.1 M sodium acetate. Five 40 ml
aliquots were prepared and adjusted to pH 4.00, 4.25, 4.50, 4.75 and 5.00 (+0.05). The
alkali preincubation medium (Barbital buffer) contained 50 mM sodium barbital, 50 mM
sodium acetate, and 30 mM CaCl,'2 H,O. Five 40 ml aliquots were prepared at pH 9.50,
9.75, 10.00, 10.25, and 10.50 (+0.05). The ATPase reaction medium contained 2.73 mM
ATP in the Barbital buffer at pH 9.4. Slides were preincubated in acid treatments for 5
minutes and in alkali treatments for 10 minutes. Longer preincubation times were
adapted into the Guth and Samaha procedure. The slides were then washed in 100 mM
Tris/19 mM CaCl, for 10 seconds and placed in the ATPase reaction medium. The acid
and alkali tissues were incubated with agitation in this medium for 60 and 30 minutes at
room temperature respectively, and the no-preincubation tissues were incubated with the
alkali solution. Following incubation, the slides were washed in 200 mM Cacl, 3 times
30 seconds each. The slides were then soaked in 2% CoCl, for 1.5 minutes and washed
in 100mM Tris, pH 9.4 3 times, 30 seconds each. The slides were soaked in 1%
ammonium sulfide for 1 minute and washed in dH,0 3 times, 30 seconds each. Lastly,
the slides were dehydrated in an ethanol series and coverslipped in Permount.
Results
Water Velocity
The water velocity measurements for TI and T3 are displayed in Table 1. The
average of the velocities at a given distance horizontally across TI are shown in Figure 1.
Since the measurements showed that the water velocity in the tank is symmetrical,
measurements were taken in half of T3. The velocities measured in T3 as a function of
depth and horizontal distance from the edge of the tank are shown in Figure 2.
Speed
A.
The tuna school in TI swam with the current for approximately 13 hours of the
day and against the current for approximately 11 hours of the day, as determined from
approximately 5-10 separate observation days of most day time hours and 1-2 observation
days of night time hours. TI school observations were logged for all hours of the day
that they were swimming with the current. Scarface observations were logged
concurrently, with the exception of hours 00:00-6:00 and 20:00-00:00 when the dimmed
lighting in the TRCC made it extremely difficult to identify an individual. When the
school was swimming against the current, Scarface data was also a challenge to obtain
due to the tendency of the tuna to swim inconsistent laps. Nevertheless, a few
observations were successfully logged and were pooled from limited times of the day,
then extrapolated to account for any hour of the day in which Scarface was swimming
against the current.
B.
T3
The tuna in T3 swam with the current and against the current for approximately
equal amounts of time throughout the day as determined from 5-10 separate day time and
1-2 separate night time observation days. Data was collected for swimming across a
distance of 3 m distance during all hours of the day.
Speeds were calculated in m/s and body lengths/s (1s). Speed (1/s) as a function
of time of day is shown in Figure 3. Average speed (m/s) and average speed (1/s) is
shown in Table 2. A t-Test was run with an alpha of 5% to determine the significance or
lack thereof between the mean speeds (1/s) calculated, the resultsof which are displayed in
Table 3. The mean swimming speed (Is) of TI and T3 were found to be significantly
different. See Figure 4.
Distance
A. TI
﻿12
Calculations show that the average tuna in TI travels: 75, 322.29 body
lengths/day, 83.61 km/day, 51.95 mi/day, or approximately 3,300 laps/day. Scarface
travels: 74, 594.13 body lengths/day, 82.80 km/day, 51.45 mi/day, or approximately
3,300 laps/ day
B. T3
An average individual in T3 travels: 103,507.2 body lengths/day, 75.82 km/day,
or 47.11 mi/day.
Tailbeats
Tailbeats/sec through the 3m distance sampled when the tuna are travelling with
the current (w/c) and against the current (a/c) are displayed as a frequency histogram in
Figures 5. With the current, the tailbeat frequency median was 1.25, mean was 1.17 and
standard deviation was 0.46. Against the current, the median was 1.34, mean was 1.28,
and standard deviation was 0.36. A Two Tail Two Sample t-Test assuming equal
variance conducted on these two samples, with an n of 1718 and 2196 individual
observations respectively, revealed that the means are significantly different with a p-
value of 2.2 E-16. This p-value is extremely small for means that differ only by 0.11,
but the n'is large. A two tail F-test was also conducted to insure that the assumption that
the variances were equal was valid and yielded a p-value of 9.03E-30.
Histology
A. Cytochrome Oxidase
High levels of cytochrome oxidase activity are typically found in red aerobic
muscle. Figure 6 shows red muscle from quarantine yellowfin tuna. Staining indicates
the presence of cytochrome oxidase activity in the mitochondria of the wild tuna white
anaerobic muscle tissue; see Figure 7. The red staining in the quarantine tuna tissue and
TRCC tuna tissue is indicative of cytochrome oxidase activity and is shown in Figures 8
and 9 respectively. The overall staining intensity is lighter in the captive white muscle
tissues. Since the assays were run simultaneously with the tissues treated on the same
slide, this result could not be due to any procedural differences.
B. Myosin ATPase
Staining was present in all of the pHs assayed, however differences in staining
intensity between tissues were most prominent at pH 4.0 and pH 4.5. The brown staining
present at pH 4.0 in wild tuna white muscle, quarantine tuna white muscle, and TRCC
tuna muscle tissue indicates the presence of myosin ATPase and can be seen in Figures
10, 11, and 12 respectively. Similarly, the brown staining present at pH 4.5 in wild tuna
red muscle, quarantine tuna red muscle, and TRCC tuna red muscle tissue also indicates
the presence of myosin ATPase and can be seen in Figures 13, 14, and 15 respectively.
In both cases, the wild tuna muscle tissue stains considerably lighter than both the
quarantine and TRCC tuna muscle tissue. Again, the assays were run simultaneously
with the tissues treated on the same slide.
Behavior
A.
TI
The tuna in TI displayed schooling behavior when swimming with the current.
The position of any individual in the school changed continuously from the inside to the
outside and front to back of the pack with seemingly no prescribed pattern. They spent
approximately 13 hours of the day with and 11 hours of the day against the current, and
most of the hours spent against the current occurred at night between the hours of 22:00
and 7:00. It is not known if this pattern is constant from day to day. At night, the
average radius swam and lap time decreased substantially as the tuna moved closer to the
center of the tank when the main lights in the TRCC were turned off. Since night time
speed calculations were essentially the same as day time calculations, it appears that these
effects offset one another. Speed varied insignificantly with time of day. One light
directly above the center of the tank remains on at night. When swimming against the
current, the schooling behavior, prominent when the tuna travel with the current,
deteriorated somewhat as the school became less dense, and more individual behavior
could be observed. The tendency for the tuna to spend a majority of their time travelling
through the vortex in the center of the tank was the most typical behavior observed.
B.
T3
The tuna in 13 most often swam inconsistent laps, regardless of their orientation
to the current, and seemed to spend an equal amount of time travelling through the vortex
in each direction. They also spent approximately equal amounts of time travelling with
and against the current and would switch directions with a frequency of about once per
hour, although they could switch directions as frequently as once every 2 minutes when
disturbed by activity in the TRCC such as prefeeding routines. The night time
phenomenon of moving toward the center mentioned above in TI was also displayed to a
lesser extent in T3.
C.
Burst Behavior
The tuna in both tanks would occasionally display burst swimming behavior in
which they sprinted around the tank at a speed that appeared to be at least 3 times that of
sustained swimming speeds. Often, burst swimming would be accompanied by a side¬
swimming display in which the tuna would swim on its side for a length of time up to
approximately 8 seconds. The individual side-swimming usually, but not always, began
the behavior by following directly behind another tuna within a proximity of just a few
centimeters.
Discussion
Speed
The calculated speeds of 0.91 1/s of TI tuna (§ 1.11 m length) and 1.19 1s of T3
tuna (20.7325 m length) were found to be significantly different from one another. This
phenomenon may result from the fact that the tuna are much larger, due to age, in TI than
in 13, and it has been shown that speed decreases as size increases (Wu, Theodore Y. and
Yates, George T., 1978). The different speed may also be due in part to the lack of the
3rd dimension of speed, the height in the water column, which was not taken into account
in this study. TI is 1.67 times deeper than T3, and it is possible that this parameter is
important when calculating tuna speed and distance swam. The TI tuna mean speed value
falls within the range of 0.68-0.98 1/s observed through tracking for yellowfin tuna of
similar size in the wild (0.96m and 0.98 m in length) (Carey and Olson, 1982). Similarly.
the T3 mean speed value also falls within the range of 1.19-1.28 1/s observed through
tracking wild tuna of similar size (0.7225-0.745 m in length) (Holland et al., 1990).
These, as well as data collected of wild tuna held in captivity for a minimum period of
time, are presented as a summary of published yellowfin tuna mean swimming speeds in
Table 4. These data for wild tuna present obvious problems in a direct comparison, the
difference in size of the tuna body length between the wild and captive fish the most
problematic since absolute speed in body lengths/sec decreases with an increase in size
(Wu, Theodore Y. and Yates George T., 1978). Therefore, the disparity between captive
and wild speed values could potentially result from several parameters. In addition to
difference in body lengths, the tracking data may lack accuracy due to the fact that the
vertical component of three-dimensional distance travelled is not taken into account. The
difference in ambient temperature of the captive tuna and wild tuna may have slowed the
metabolic rate of the captive tuna, thus lowering its respiration requirements for oxygen
and thereby lowering the speed the tuna must maintain to obtain the necessary oxygen.
And, finally, the tank size may be limiting their cruising behavior by confining them to a
speed slower than would be observed in the wild.
The distance travelled by the four tuna tracked by Carey and Olsen in the wild is
also very comparable to that travelled in captivity. The tuna of fork length 0.96, and 0.98
m travelled average distances of 3.4 and 2.4 km in an hour respectively, whereas the TI
tuna travelled an average of 3.48 km/hour. The tuna of fork length 0.89 and 0.87 m
travelled 5.9, 3.5 km in an hour respectively, while the T3 tuna travelled an average of
3.45 km/hour.
Throughout a 24 hour period, no significant difference in swimming speed could
be delineated. This lack of fluctuation indicates that their speed is relatively constant
throughout the day and is not affected by natural light/dark cycles. Similarly, no
17
significant difference in against the current and with the current swimming speed relative
to the water was found, implying that the tuna velocity may be dictated by the amount of
water they pass through or that passes over their gills rather than actual distance swam.
Tailbeats
However, the overall level of activity of the tuna is dependent on whether it is
swimming with or against the current, as is indicated by the significantly greater tailbeat
frequency through a distance of 3 m when travelling against the current. Tailbeat
frequency typically increases with velocity (Hunter and Zweifel, 1971), but in the case of
the TRCC tuna, the velocity against the current is essentially the same as that with the
current, yet their tailbeat frequency increases against the current. The tailbeat frequency
of a 0.53 m long wild yellowfin tuna travelling at 1.2 Us (0.636 m/s) was determined in a
large water tunnel to be 2.25 tailbeats/sec, whereas the median for the 0.7325 m long
TRCC tuna was 1.25 tailbeats/s with and 1.34 tailbeats/s against the current (Dewar and
Graham, 1994). This difference indicates that the TRCC tuna are less active than wild
tuna. However, this difference may also be due to a difference in fish size.
Histology
The assay for cytochrome oxidase activity in wild and captive muscle tissue was
used as an index of the aerobic activity of the muscle. It was expected that white muscle
would stain lighter than red muscle due to the lower cytochrome oxidase activity. It is
clear that there is a difference in the level of staining of the white muscle tissue between
the wild tuna and the quarantine and TRCC captive tuna. Small red dots in the cells of
the wild tuna white muscle most likely represent mitochondria in which cytochrome
18
oxidase reactions have taken place. The quarantine and TRCC white muscle do not
contain any similar structures and overall staining is lighter, indicating fewer
mitochondria and less cytochrome oxidase activity than that of the wild tuna. One could
conclude from this result that the wild tuna has a higher level of this enzyme activity,
possibly due to a higher aerobic capacity of its white muscle, and therefore the wild tuna
most likely uses its white muscle more than do the captive tuna.
No obvious difference could be seen in the staining of the red muscle tissue
between the wild and captive tuna. Since the red muscle is used for slow, aerobic
swimming activity, perhaps, as is suggested by the similar TRCC and wild tuna cruising
speeds, that this muscle is used in an equivalent capacity in both populations.
Myosin ATPase
The myosin ATPase assay was conducted at several pHs, all of which had a
considerable amount of staining. A substantial difference in staining between similar
tissues of different tuna was detected at low pHs. At pH 4.5, wild tuna aerobic red
muscle stains lighter than that of the captive quarantine or TRCC aerobic red muscle.
Similarly, the anaerobic white muscle tissue of the wild tuna also stains lighter than that
of the captive quarantine and TRCC tuna. These results indicate that different isoforms
of myosin ATPase are being expressed in the wild and captive tuna, and that the isoform
expressed in the wild tuna tissue is sensitive to low pH, the most sensitive at pH 4.5 for
red tissue and pH 4.0 for white tissue.
Behavior
The speed and activity level of the tuna was fairly constant throughout all hours of
the day, a result that is interesting in light of the fact that the tuna alternate direction.
especially since they must work harder to travel against the current. This phenomenon
could be due to simply a desire for variety, fun, or entertainment. Their tendency to
travel through the vortex may be for the same reason. TI tuna were more consistent in
their school and lap behavior than T3 tuna, and possible reasons for this difference in
behavior may lie in the fact that the TI fish are older and have been in captivity longer
than 13 fish, and therefore the TI tuna are more calm and more experienced with school
“etiquette". The difference may also be due to the difference in tank size and/or the
difference in water velocity.
Their tendency to swim near the center of the tank at night may be due to an
attraction to the light.
The reason for the side-swimming behavior is unknown, but, since it appears to be
an interactive display, it may be a communicative behavior, possibly related to courtship
or mating.
Conclusions
Together, the lower average speed of the captive tuna, the lighter cytochrome
oxidase staining of the captive tuna, and the differential myosin ATPase staining of the
captive tuna relative to the wild tuna indicate that captivity does have an effect on
yellowfin tuna activity, resulting in a change in properties of muscle aerobic enzymes and
force generation.
Future studies to discover more about the effects of captivity on the activity of
yellowfin tuna will be important to understanding the tuna response and optimizing
captive conditions to best maintain tuna in captivity. A closer look at tailbeat frequency
and amplitude may reveal interesting patterns and may show how tuna use their muscle in
à more quantitative fashion. It would be interesting to continue speed observations
throughout the year to investigate the possibility of seasonal variation, as well as to
observe speed at different water temperatures to ascertain the magnitude of temperature
effects. The TRCC fish do occasionally sprint around the tank, and their maximum speed
is not known nor is the frequency of this behavior.
