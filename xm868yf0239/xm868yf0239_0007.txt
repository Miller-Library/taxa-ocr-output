Free-swimming experiments
Three squid were placed in a fifty gallon tank filled with seawater and escape
jets were elicited using a strobe flash. Temperature was increased from 4'-12'C, and
responses were recorded onto Hi-8 tapes using the Sony video camera. Trials were
later resampled onto a laboratory computer and were analyzed using NIH image.
Results
Changes in flash-elicited escape jets with temperature
Escape responses were elicited using a strobe flash, and Fig. 2Ai shows an
example of the resulting pressure transient (upper trace) and stellar nerve discharge
(lower trace) at 12.5°C. The complete pressure transient is displayed at a slower time
base in Fig. 2Aii. Figures B-E display pressure transients and neural activity as
temperature is sequentially lowered to 5.0'C.
Pressure transients at 12°C confirm the stereotyped neural activity and pressure
transients revealed in earlier experiments (Ötis and Gilly, 1990). However, the
pressure transient shows a substantial increase in both duration and amplitude as
temperature is lowered. Duration increases from around 300ms at 12°C to 700ms at
5°C, and peak amplitude increases substantially. Changes in the overall shape of the
pressure transient are also evident, although the initial rate of rise and the maximum
rate of relaxation do not appear to be markedly affected. At a critical transition range of
8°-10°C, a plateau appears (Fig 2Dii), which extends the time of peak amplitude before
