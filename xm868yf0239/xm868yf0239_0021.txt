Table 1. Temperature-dependence of peak amplitude of pressure transients
from a representative experiment. As temperature is cooled, peak
amplitudes elicited by a flash response increase, becoming larger than
peak amplitudes elicited by shock responses. Peak amplitudes elicited by
shock responses exceed flash-elicited, peak amplitudes both at and above
ambient levels, but are much smaller below ambient temperature.
