aquarium and was recorded on a chart recorder.
Escape jets were elicited using either a strobe flash or an electrical shock
delivered to the base of the arms. Strobe flashes visually stimulated the animal
directly, and produced a stereotyped response. Electric shocks produced more
delayed and variable responses. Trials were videotaped using a Sony CCD-IRIS
video camera. Additionally, movies were captured by a frame-grabber on a laboratory
computer in 33ms frames which could later be resolved into 16ms frames and
analyzed using NIH- image software.
Intra-mantle pressure was recorded with an analog transducer that was
attached to a hyperdermic needle inserted into the mantle cavity. Pressure transients
were recorded onto both a chart recorder and a DC-coupled digital audio recorder
(Sony DTC-670).
Extra-cellular recordings of neural activity were made by cutting a hole over the
stellate ganglion of a restrained animal and then exposing stellar nerves for en
passant recordings. Recordings were made by a polyethylene suction electrode,
usually placed on the second or third-hindmost stellar nerve just past the stellate
ganglion, and were recorded onto Hi-8 tapes using a Sony (EVÃ– 9700) 8mm video
deck and also onto the digital audio tapes to be later resampled using a laboratory
computer. Some neural recordings were made after cutting two 4cm slits in the ventral
surface of the mantle, and this procedure minimized artifacts due to water being
expelled through the hole above the stellate ganglion during strong jets which
splashed the recording electrode.
