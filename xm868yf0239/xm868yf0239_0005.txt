Behavioral experiments
Animals were restrained by gluing the dorsal mantle surface to a plastic holding
platform with cyanoacrylate cement in order to obtain neural and pressure recordings.
This holding platform was suspended in an aquarium with free-flowing, aerated
seawater. Squid could be removed from this platform at the completion of an
experiment, and were often returned to the holding tanks where they displayed normal
behavior and sometimes survived for lengths of time comparable to squid not
experimented on.
Using a cooling unit and the arrangement schematized in Fig. 1, water
temperatures in the aquarium were cooled from 13'-5°C at a rate of 1C per 5 minute
interval, and could be warmed back to 13'C, then cooled again in the duration of one
experiment. Free-flowing, ambient seawater (12°C) could be turned on or off by a
valve. The aquarium was filled with this 12°C water, then the source was shut off and
an alternate water source from the cooling unit pumped 3'C water into the aquarium.
This water mixed with the 12°C water, and as water continued to circulate through the
aquarium and back into the cooling unit, overall aquarium temperature was
decreased. Aquarium temperature could be raised by shutting off the 3'C water line
and turning back on the 12°C line, allowing the circulation of this water through the
flow-through system to gradually warm the aquarium. Water was also warmed from
13°-17°C by adding warmed water into the tank, then cooled again using the 12’C
water line. Temperature was constantly monitored with a thermistor probe in the
