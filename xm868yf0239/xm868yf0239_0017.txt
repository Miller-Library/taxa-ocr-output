Figure 1. Water temperature system. 12°C water is used to fill the experimental
aquarium, then is shut off and 3°C water is pumped in. This 3°C water mixes with the
12•C water and gradually lowers the temperature while being recycled through the
chiller in a closed water system. To warm the water, the 3°C water line is closed and
12°C water is pumped into the aquarium. Cold water is allowed to leave the system.
Figure 2. Temperature-dependence of the stellar nerve discharge (lower traces) anc
the corresponding intra-mantle pressure transient (upper traces) during flash-elicited
startle responses in a restrained squid. Experiment was started at 12.5°C (A), and
temperature was lowered to 5°C (E). Giant axon events are indicated by arrows.
Complete pressure transients are displayed on the right.
Figure 3. Temperature dependence of small fiber activity. Values were determined by
calculating the rms values for 7.5 ms segments of neural activity. The rms value
served as a measure of the amount of deviation of neural activity from a baseline
defined by background activity (level between stimulus artifact and the large peak due
to giant axon activity).
Figure 4. Temperature dependence of escape-jetting performance in free-swimming
squid. Values are the mean of three squid studied simultaneously in the same tank.
(A.) Cumulative distance traveled following a flash stimulus. (B) Velocity computed
from the data in (A). Squid were placed in a fifty gallon tank filled with 5.5°C water.
and water was warmed up to 12°C by partially draining the tank and adding ambient¬
temperature seawater in increments.
