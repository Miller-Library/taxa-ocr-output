become greatly compromised as temperatures are lowered. It is not yet known why
this may be, but it seems that the two systems lose their ability to coordinate together in
complex ways, and therefore are not able to elicit as strong a pressure transient as is
possible at warmer temperatures where the two systems work in concert.
As temperature is increased above 12’C, delayed-type escape responses do
not seem to be significantly compromised, and show peak pressure amplitudes
comparable to those seen at 12°C. Though it has not been confirmed in the present
experiments whether giant axons actually fire at elevated temperatures, the
maintained level of performance seen relative to 12'C suggests that the giant and non¬
giant fiber systems are still working in coordination. All of ÖOtis and Gilly's (1990) work
was actually carried out above 12°0.
Coordination of giant and non-giant fiber systems
As temperature is decreased, the stereotyped escape response elicited by a
flash shows increasing coordination between parallel giant and non-giant fiber
systems, providing not only maintenance of performance, but an actual increase in
performance when compared to warmer temperatures. Conversely, when temperature
is decreased the shock-elicited response shows decreasing ability to coordinate giant
and small fiber systems, showing decreased performance at colder temperatures
(Table 1). This study shows that these two types of escape responses coordinate the
two motor systems in different ways. In a flash-elicited response the firing of the giant
axon is followed by small axon activity, whereas in a shock-elicited response the firing
