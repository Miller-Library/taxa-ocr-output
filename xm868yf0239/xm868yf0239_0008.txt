relaxation. At temperatures lower than this range, an additional slower rise in
pressure amplitude follows the plateau period (Fig 2Eii).
Neural activity accompanying escape jets at different temperatures
Neural activity shows two important changes over the temperature range. First
a second giant axon spike in Fig. 2Di appears quite reliably in the 8°-10’C range, and
sometimes one or two spikes are present at essentially the same temperature (Fig. 20i
and Fig. 2Di). However, this second giant axon spike can also appear at temperatures
lower than this range and rarely (once) does not occur at all upon cooling.
Additionally, an increase occurs at lower temperatures in both the intensity and
duration of the burst of non-giant axon firing after the giant spike. This increase in
intensity of non-giant firing appears to be a coordinated and synchronous discharge
manifested as a slow wave immediately following each giant spike in Fig 2. An
attempt to quantify the increase in non-giant activity is presented in Fig 3. The rms
value of each 7.5ms segment of neural activity was determined using data sampled on
a laboratory computer, and served as a measure of total deviation of neural activity
from the baseline defined by background activity. More activity exists at 6'C than at
12°0. This increase in non-giant activity thus appears to be important. In contrast to
repetitive giant axon activity, which appears at a certain temperature and remains
unchanged thereafter, the increase in intensity and duration of small axon activity
appears to be graded over the entire temperature range.
