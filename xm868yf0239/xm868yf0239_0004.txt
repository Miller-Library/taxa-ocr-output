complex central coordination of giant and non-giant motor systems. Small axons
always fire in this type of response, and giant axons may or may not follow a burst of
small axon activity (Otis & Gilly, 1990). Giant axons clearly provide a boost to the intra¬
mantle pressure, providing a more powerful jet, but activation of the giant axons is not
necessary for strong escape behavior.
These escape responses afford Loligo high performance levels at ambient
(surface) sea water temperatures, but little is known about how these responses are
affected by temperature changes. Many components of nervous function are highly
temperature dependent, such as conduction characteristics and synaptic transmission
but it is unclear how any individual component would affect whole animal
performance.
A better understanding of this overall coordination is particularly relevant, given
Loligo's frequent exposure to large temperature changes. Loligo is pelagic and
vertically migrates through temperatures ranging from 13'-5°C. Loligo encounters
predators throughout this temperature range, and it is presumably important that it be
able to maintain escape performance at all temperatures. This study addresses the
question as to how Loligo might compensate for these temperature changes by
studying the temperature dependence of intra-mantle pressure transients and the
patterns of stellar nerve motor activity during escape jetting.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Loligo opalescens was collected from Monterey Bay and maintained in large
holding tanks filled with free-flowing seawater (12-13'C). Animals were separated by
sex in order to prolong health and were kept in the laboratory for up to two weeks after
