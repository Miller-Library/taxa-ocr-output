of small axon activity is followed by giant axon firing if the giants are recruited.
These different styles of coordination found in the two types of escape
responses must play a biologically relevant role for squid traveling through large
temperature ranges in relatively short periods of time. Changes in the way the two
systems work in concert may take advantage of or compensate for different properties
of the squid’s physiology that may be affected by temperature changes. For instance,
the shock-elicited response seems to be more adaptive at warm temperatures, where
its more delayed and variable jets may allow an animal to choose not only whether or
not it responds to a stimulus, but also to what degree it responds. Such a highly
flexible escape response may also act to conserve energy, in contrast to the
stereotyped flash response where there is a reaction of fixed amount every time.
However, if colder temperatures somehow compromise the central nervous
system’s ability to provide rapid and accurate assessment of a threatening situation, it
might be more advantageous to employ a more simple but powerful startle response
that guarantees a strong and reliable jet. Therefore, although the more flexible,
delayed-type response is compromised by colder temperatures, the startle response
becomes stronger and more reliable. In this way, differing methods of coordinating
parallel giant and non-giant motor axons may allow Loligo incredible flexibility that
allows it to travel freely through the changing temperature conditions it experiences
daily.
