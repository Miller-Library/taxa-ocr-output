firing relative to activity at 12'C was witnessed.
Shock-elicited escape responses
Preliminary work with delayed-type escape responses elicited by electric
shocks indicates that the peak amplitude of delayed jets decreases as temperature
decreases, reflecting a general trend of compromised performance at colder
temperatures (Table 1). Attempts to detect coordinated firing of the giant and non¬
giant axons, regularly seen at 12'C or above (Otis & Gilly, 1990), were unsuccessful at
temperatures below 10°C. However, it is difficult to determine whether this reflects the
actual absence of giant fiber activity or was instead due to a shortcoming in the
recordings.
Discussion
Flash-elicited responses
As temperature was decreased during flash-elicited escape responses,
pressure transients showed an increase in amplitude and duration, as well as an
introduction of a plateau followed by a subsequent slower increase in amplitude after
a transition range of 8°-10°C. Neural recordings showed both the appearance of a
second giant axon spike in a temperature range of 8'-10'C and an increase in small
axon activity marked by both a greater intensity and duration of firing and an
increasing summation of activity. Previous work done by Young on the repetitive firing
