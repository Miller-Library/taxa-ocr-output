of giant axons suggests that this repetitive firing causes an increase in the duration of
a pressure transient by extending the duration of the peak amplitude before the
pressure begins to subside (Young, 1938). This can explain both the increase in
duration seen in the pressure transients in Fig. 2 A-E as well as the introduction of a
plateau period. However, Young's work has also shown that additional firing of giants
cannot increase the peak amplitude of the pressure transient and therefore cannot
explain the additional slow rise in amplitude seen in Fig. 2Eii. This suggests that the
slow rise is not due to the repetitive firing of the giant axon.
Repetitive stimulation of small axons can cause graded increases in pressure
amplitude and duration (Wilson, 1959). Preliminary results showing increased small
axon activity both in terms of intensity and duration suggest that the additional
increase in amplitude is attributable to this. Further, it is hypothesized that the critically
timed summation of small axon activity immediately following the giant spike might
also lead to a more powerful circular muscle contraction.
This suggests that as temperature is decreased, the parallel giant and small
fiber systems become increasingly active both separately and in coordination.
Contrary to warmer temperatures at which the contribution by the giant axon system is
predominant, colder temperatures are conducive to summation by the two motor
systems. Although it remains to be determined exactly how these two systems work
together, it is clear that a giant axon always fires first and is then followed by a burst of
small axon activity. This burst becomes more prominent at lower temperatures
probably because of both increased synchronization, resulting in a summed, slow
wave (Fig. 2), and an increase in the total period of discharge (Fig. 3). Both
