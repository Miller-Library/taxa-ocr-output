Escape jets in non-restrained squid at different temperatures
Free-swimming animals were also studied in order to establish how
temperature changes affected whole-animal escape performance. Fig. 4A shows the
distance traveled at both 5.5°C and 12°C (average of 3 animals) as a function of time
elapsed after the stimulus. Results show that animals at lower temperatures
consistently traveled further distances than animals at warmer temperatures, with
intermediate distances traveled by animals in the middle of this temperature range. At
5.5°C an escape jet propelled the squid twice as far as at 12°0. Fig. 4B shows the
average, instantaneous velocity traveled by the same three animals, as derived from
data in Fig. 4A. Animals at colder temperatures reach a slightly higher maximum
velocity and clearly maintain elevated velocity for a longer period of time. However,
animals at colder temperatures show a longer delay from time of stimulus to peak
velocity than animals at warmer temperatures, a trend that can also be seen in Fig. 4A.
Escape jets above 12°0
Preliminary work shows that upon warming from 12'-17°C, several changes
occur in flash-elicited escape responses. At a critical temperature range between 14'-
16°C, intra-mantle pressures decrease suddenly to an amplitude of only about 10% of
that at 12°C (Table 1). Neural recordings indicate that the disappearance of the giant
axon spike corresponds to this dramatic decrease in pressure. Only small fiber activity
was seen at temperatures above this range, and no summation or longer duration of
