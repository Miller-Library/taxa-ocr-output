mechanisms could lead to a greater contribution of the small axon system to the jet. It
also seems likely that the double firing of the giant axon allows an additional
synchronous discharge of small axons which provides a second period of summation
during the response and effectively supplies a second "dose" of summed small fiber
activity. The additional firing of the giant axon itself appears to have a minimal effect at
a given temperature and serves to hold the pressure at a steady level which may allow
the small axon system to fire for a longer time and thereby provide the subsequent
boost added to this maintained level. Reasons for the occasional single firing of a
giant axon at colder temperatures where double firing is usually seen are not known.
Preliminary research looking at warming above 12â€™C may serve to confirm the
temperature dependence of coordination between the two systems. Just as cooling
serves to increase the amount of summation by the two systems, warming seems to
increasingly separate the systems to a point where the giant axons no longer respond
and the small fiber system fires for only a very short time, producing only a weak
response. This means that pressure transients with the largest peak amplitude are
found at cold temperatures, with increasingly smaller peak amplitudes as
temperatures are warmed.
Shock-elicited responses
As temperature is decreased, the peak amplitude of the pressure transient
during a delayed-type escape response is decreased, and the giant axon system does
not appear to be recruited. Therefore, shock-elicited escape responses seem to
