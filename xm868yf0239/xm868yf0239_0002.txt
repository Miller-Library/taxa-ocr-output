Abstract
Loligo opalescens migrates vertically, experiencing large temperature changes
in short amounts of time. Loligo depends on jet-propulsion for escape behavior, and
at 12°C shows an escape response that uses coordination between two motor systems
employing giant and non-giant neural fibers. Little is known about escape behavior at
colder temperatures, however, and experiments were done to determine how this
behavior changed over the biologically relevant temperature range of 12'-4’C. Squid
were restrained and recordings of stellar nerve activity and intra-mantle pressure
transients were taken during escape behavior elicited by strobe flash stimuli. As
temperature decreased, pressure showed an increase in amplitude and duration, as
well as an introduction of a plateau followed by a slower increase in amplitude below
a critical transition temperature at 8'-10'C. Neural recordings suggest that these
findings may be due to both the introduction of two giant axon spikes at the transition
temperature, as well as an increase in small fiber activity at lower temperatures. In
free-swimming squid, these changes are manifested as a longer period of propulsive
thrust which moves the squid a larger distance in a given time. These findings suggest
that Loligo is able to maintain performance at colder temperatures through
coordination of the giant and non-giant motor systems in a way that is similar to, yet
distinct from, that at warmer temperatures.
Introduction
Escape behavior in Loligo utilizes a form of jet propulsion in which water is
taken into the mantle cavity and is subsequently expelled through the funnel via
synchronous contraction of circular muscles (Packard, 1968). This expulsion of water
provides an explosive jet that propels the animal large distances in short times,
providing an effective means of escape from predators. Escape behavior has been
