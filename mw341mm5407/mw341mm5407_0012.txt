Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
concentration in these two experimental solutions. Alexander
et al. (1939) suggested that calcium binding to cephalin mole¬
cules makes a tight molecular structure and thus reduces tissue
permeability, and Martin(1953) pointed out that calcium binding
regulates the degree of coiling of chondroitin-sulfuric acid.
thus altering the pore size of a structure. Therefore, the
greater concentration of calcium in 150% sea water may have
reduced tissue permeability to both water and jons. Another pos¬
sible explanation for the apparent faster rates of jon level
change in 50% sea water may be differences in the ability of
Nuttallina californica to clamp down in the two salinities;
Stickle and Ahokas (1974) have found faster hemolymph osmolality
fluctuations in unattached than attached specimens of Katharina
tunicata. Nuttallina californica was observed to swell con-
siderably in 50% sea water, which may have decreased its ability
to tightly clamp its girdle to the substrate and decrease its
exposure to water of low salinity.
The estimated equilibration periods suggest that the rela¬
tive rates of change of the blood ions under consideration
are : Ktca-NaNgt. In contrast, Stickle and Ahokas(1974)
