Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
correlated with high tides and immersion. The decrease in
blood K“' and increase in Ngé* levels observed when animals
were exposed may act to depress neuromuscular activity and
reduce muscle tone in N. californica during low tides, its
periods of relative inactivity. Robbins (1974) has found the
metabolic rate of N. californica in exposed conditions, as
measured by oxygen consumption, to be approximately 702 of the
rate observed when animals were submerged in sea water. Upon
return to water, the exposed animals did not show the tempo¬
rary increase in rate that would suggest the repayment of an
oxygen debt. Therefore, his results suggest that glycolysis
is depressed during periods of exposure. The changes in k'
and Mg“ levels may be correlated with these suggested modi¬
fications in metabolism. The rise in blood K* level and de¬
crease in blood Mgér level at about the 20th hour (maximum
length of exposure per day) may indicate a physiological
anticipation of a high tide and a period of high activity
by the animals.
