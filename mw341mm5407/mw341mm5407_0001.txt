Abstract
Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
Sh w
ABSTRACT
The concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and mag¬
nesium in the blood of Nuttallina californica were measured
and show the typical molluscan trend.
Over a range of experimental salinities from 50 to 1502
sea water, the blood values of sodium and magnesium were the
same as the same jons in sea water, while blood potassjum
and calcium levels were higher, possibly by active regula¬
tion.
The rate of flux was greater in 50 than in 150% sea water
for all ions; the rate series appears to be KNatcaMg?
In exposed animals, sodium and calcium were held constant.
Potassium was initially lowered, magnesium raised; these
changes may be correlated with an observed lowering of
metabolism on exposure to air.
