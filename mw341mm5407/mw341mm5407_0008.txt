level of "t test" significance, except the blood Ca2t of animals
in 1003 sea water which was higher with only 90% significance.
The blood and sea water ion levels in 50Zand 150% sea water
were measured outside the range of jon standards and are not
accurate absolute values (eg., note in Fig. I that the measured
Caër mean for 100% sea water is not twice the measured Ca2
mean for 50% sea water). Valid comparisons of relative jon con¬
centrations can be made only at one salinity for a single jon;
however, comparisons of the time required for new equilibrium
Values to be reached are possible, among salinities and among
jons. Due to the variability in the data, highly accurate
equilibration periods or even half-equilibration periods can
not be determined. Rough estimates of the equilibration perjods
were made by graphically determining the time required for the
blood jons to attain their estimated new equilibrium levels.
These estimates are presented in Table 2. The equilibration
periods for all the cations measured were slightly longer in
the 150% sea water than in 50% sea water. In both 50gand 1502
sea waters, Mg- had the longest equilibration period; &at had
