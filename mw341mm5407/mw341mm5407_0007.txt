centrations of Na" and Ngé were not significantly different
from the concentrations of these jons in sea water. Much of
the variability in the data is thought to have been contributed
by "machine drift", during spectrophotometer operation, which
was not completely corrected for by adjusting all the experimen¬
tal blood ion values to values which correspond to sea water
ion values corrected to their mean. The high blood Nat and Mg?t
values for 100% sea water at hour 27.5 probably result from
uncorrected drift. Blood K and Ca2* concentrations were sig¬
nificantly higher than the concentrations of these jons in sea
water (see Table 1). The results of tests for significant dif¬
ferences between blood and 100% sea water jon levels, based
upon the "Student's't-test, are presented in Table 1; changes
in ionic composition of the blood of experimental animals
during the period of observation are shown in Figure 1.
When the chitons were placed in 50%and 150% sea water, the
concentrations of blood Nat and Ng after a period of time
were not different from the concentrations of these jons in
the experimental solutions. K* and Ca2 were higher in the
blood than in sea water at all salinities to at least the 952
