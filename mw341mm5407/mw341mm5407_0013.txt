Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
found the rate series Mgåtkt Nab ca2t for Katharina tunicata
and Nat Mgetkt Ca for Thais lamellosa(Gmelin,1792), while
Tucker (1970) found Ca2tk Nab Nge for Scutus breviculus(Blain-
ville,1817). The ion flux rate series expected if the concen¬
tration changes were due to integument permeability alone is;
K5 Na CactMg due to the increasing diameter of the hydrated
ions. The similarity of this latter series with that observed for
Nuttallina californica suggests that integument permeability
may be the major factor determining relative rates of change,
although the rate series is based on only 3 points in twelve
hours.
The animals maintained in humid drained tubs for 55 hours
probably did not lose significant amounts of body water during
this interval. The concentrations of Na' and ca2 jons were
never significantly different from the levels of those in
control animals in 100% sea water. The changes in blood K
and Mge levels of animals in exposed conditions are inter¬
esting. K' initially became lower than the same ion of control
animals in 100% sea water, returned to the control level by
