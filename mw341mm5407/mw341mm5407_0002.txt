Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
INTRODUCTION
The blood of marine molluscs, with the exception of the
cephalopods, is similar but not identical to sea water in
inorganic composition. The analyses of various workers are
well summarized by Robertson(1964). In general, the concentra¬
tions of sodium and magnesium are the same in the blood and
in sea water while potassium and calcium are more concentrated
in the blood. Except for blood jon values for Katharina tuni¬
cata (Wood,1815) in conditions of fluctuating salinity(Stickle
and Ahokas, 1974), data are nonexistent for blood jonic compo¬
sition for the whole classes Amphineura and Scaphopoda,
Polyplacophoran molluscs are common members of the inter-
tidal fauna of the Pacific Coast of North America. Nuttallina
californica(Reeve,1847) is a small chiton, seldom more than
5 cm long, that is fairly restricted to the middle intertidal
zone of exposed shores from Puget Sound to the Coronado Is¬
lands. Nuttallina californica is usually found in moderately
exposed rocky crevice habitats. It is subject to large fluc¬
tuations of sea water salinity caused by such factors as rain
run-off, evaporation, and summer fog, and is exposed to air
