Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
inversely related in a series of crustaceans; he suggests that
an increase in blood magnesium and decreased activity are
causally related. A study of the isolated walking legs of
Larcinus indicates that perfusion with a fluid containing 1.5
to 2 times the blood concentration of magnesjum depresses
neuromus cular transmission (Katz,1936) and perfusing with a
fluid containing only 57to 202 of the blood Ng2t concentration
enhances the submaximal muscular response (Boardman and collier.
1946). Findings that the mechanical response to nerve stimu¬
lation varies inversely with the magnesium concentration in
the perfusing fluid have also been reported in three other
decapods, Maia, Panulirus, and Cambarus (Waterman,1941).
The foregoing findings suggest the possibility that the
initial rise in blood magnesium levels and decrease in blood
potassium levels observed when specimens of Nuttallina cali
fornica were subjected to exposed conditions may have parti¬
cular significance to the biology of these animals. Nishi(1974)
has observed low activity in N. californica to be correlated
with low tides, or times of exposure, and high activity to be
