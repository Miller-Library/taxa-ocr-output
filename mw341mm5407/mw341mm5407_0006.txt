Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
potassium standards were prepared by adding Nat solution, HNO2,
and distilled water to 1000 ppm standard stock solution supplied
by Harleco, Philadelphia, Pa., resulting in standards with 1000
ppm Naf, 12 HNO3; Caef, Mg2t, and sodium standards were made by
adding Kr solution, HNOg and distilled water to 1000 ppm stock
solution, resulting in standards with 1000 ppm K* and 12 HNO..
After 24 hours, the 507and 150% solutions of one set of animals
were replaced with 100% sea water. At the same time, 100% sea
water was added to one set of animals that had been exposed to
Dir.
Although animals were weighed at the time blood was taken, no
significant correlation between animal size and jonic composition
Was observed. A total of 91 Nuttallina californica were examined
during the experiment. Blood was taken from each animal at only
one time.
RESULTS
For chitons maintained in 1002 sea water, the blood conÂ¬
