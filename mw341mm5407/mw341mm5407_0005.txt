to air throughout the experiment.
Measurements of jon levels were made on samples of blood
withdrawn from the area of the heart and pericardial cavity.
The heart, contained within the pericardium, lies directly
beneath shell valves 7 and 8, and the fluid was withdrawn
directly by puncturing the dorsal body wall between these two
valves and inserting a piece of capillary tubing. No signi¬
ficant difference was found between samples taken as indicated
and from positions more anterior. Usually three and occasionally
o animals were used at a sample time. At the same times, sam¬
ples of the sea water solutions were taken. Sampling was for
intervals up to 55 hours.
All samples were analyzed shortly after collection using
a Perkin-Elmer 303 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The
analytic procedure was based on suggestions given in the Perkin¬
Elmer 303 Analytic Methods Manual. For Kt analysis, aliquots
of 50 or 100 ul. of untreated blood were diluted to 5.05 or
10.10 ml. respectively with a solution of 1000 ppm Na' to re¬
duce effects of jonization. For Ca2t, Mgér, and Naf analysis,
Dliquots of 100 pl. were diluted to a volume of 50.10 ml. with
a solution of 1000 ppm kt to reduce jonization effects. The
