the 24°" hour, and continued to rise until it became signif¬
icantly higher than the K' level of immersed animals. Ma?t,
on the other hand, initially became significantly more con¬
centrated in the blood of exposed animals, returned to the
control level by the 2oth hour, and then dropped slightly be¬
low the Mgér level of the control animals. Later it returned
to the level in immersed animals. It has been demonstrated
that moderate increases in potassium jons (507to 1002 and
more) have a stimulatory action on the neuromuscular system
(eg., Wells,1928; Ross and Pantin,1940). Bethe(1927) found that
an increase in potassium in the external medium augmented
Thythmical movements in medusae, phoronid worms and various
crustaceans. Robertson (1953) suggests that the higher muscular
activity of members of the Cephalopoda compared with the Lamel¬
libranchia or Gastropoda may be related to the high k con-
centrations maintained in the blood by members of this class.
In addition, Robertson (1953) points out that solutions of
magnesjum chloride can be used to narcotize marine animals
and has shown that activity and blood magnesjum level are
