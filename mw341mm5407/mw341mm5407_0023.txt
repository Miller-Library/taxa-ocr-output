Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
TABLE CAPTIONS
lable 1. Concentration of jons in blood of Nuttallina
californica compared to ion concentrations in 100% sea
water in which the animals were maintained. The "Student's'
t-test was used to determine significance levels. All
ion values are given as ma/liter.
lable 2. Estimated equilibration periods of ions in 50Zand
150% sea water. Equilibration periods were estimated by
determining the time required for the blood jons to attain
their estimated new equilibration levels.
