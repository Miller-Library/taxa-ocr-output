Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
were touched. The animals maintained in 50% sea water were in
good condition unt il the thirty-sixth hour and did not
revive upon return to 100% sea water; however, they showed
a foot response throughout the experiment.
DISCUSSION
In this study mean values of ion concentrations in Nut¬
tallina californica in 1004 sea water exhibiteathe typical
molluscan pattern, in that sodium and magnesium concentrations
were almost the same in the blood and sea water, while calcium
and potassium were maintained at higher levels in the blood
than in the ambient sea water.
In addition, in 50% and 150% sea water, the blood jons
eventually assumed the same relationship with the sea water
jons as was observed in 1004 sea water; k' and Caér were main-
tained higher than ambient sea water ion levels at all salin¬
ities, while Nat and Mg’t eventually conformed at all salinities.
