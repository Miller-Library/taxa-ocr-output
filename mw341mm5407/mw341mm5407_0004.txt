the collection area and designated 100% sea water. Each tub
contained 4 liters of sea water and not more than 17 animals;
2 tubs of the 8 were used for each experimental condition. The
animals were kept in the 100% sea water without food for at
least 44 hours but not more than 68 hours prior to the experi¬
ment. The experiments were carried out in plastic tanks con¬
taining 4 liters of experimental solution and continuously
aerated with porous stone diffusers. The animals were kept
submerged throughout the experiments with a rigid wire screen.
The tanks were covered with aluminum foil lids to reduce evap¬
oration and consequent salinity change and were set in a water
bath maintained at 13° to 14.5° C.; air temperature varied from
14.5° to 15.5° C. inside the covered tubs during the experiment.
Salinities used in this study were 502, 100% and 1502.
To prepare 150% sea water, Instant Ocean, supplied by Aquarium
Systems, Inc., Eastlake, Ohio, was added in sufficient quan¬
tity to bring 100% sea water to 150%. At time 0, the 1002 sea
water was poured from each tub, leaving the chitons attached,
and 4 liters of either 502, 1002, or 150% sea water were added.
In addition, other tubs were drained leaving the chitons exposed
