lonic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
tion of these results since all the diffusible blood cations
would be expected to show raised levels. Selective protein
binding of K" and Ca could explain their elevated levels at
all salinities but Prosser(1973) has concluded that "in all
marine animals the differences remaining after dialyses are
so small compared with the jonic differences between normal
blood and sea water that protein binding must be considered
insignificant as a regulating mechanism." Therefore it appears
that Nuttallina californica actively maintains its blood K-
and Caâ€œ levels above environmental concentrations at all
experimental salinities.
As indicated by the estimated equilibration periods, the
relative rates of change of all blood ion levels were slightly
smaller in animals in 150% sea water than in 50% sea water. It is
possible that this difference is due to cell damage in the
dilute salinity; Winterstein(1916) has shown that cell injury
leads to increased cell permeability to salts and water. It is
also possible that the difference between the ion changes in
507and 150% sea water is related to the difference in calcium
