Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
air, a condition with which it is regularly confronted, is
a topic which merits further study.
SUMMARY
1. The concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magÂ¬
nesium in the blood of Nuttallina californica have been
measured and they show the typical molluscan trend.
Over a range of experimental salinities from 507to 1502
sea water, blood values of Na and Mg were the same as
the respective sea water ion values, while blood potassjum
and calcium levels were higher than the levels of the
same ions in the experimental solutions. Potassjum and
calcium may be actively regulated whereas Na' and Mg
are in passive equilibrium.
3. The rate of flux was apparently greater in 507than in 150%
sea water for all jons; the rate series appears to be:
