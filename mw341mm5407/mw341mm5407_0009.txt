The animals kept immersed in 1002 sea water remained in
good condition until hour 39. After this time they were only
slightly attached to the bottom of the tubs, although they
still responded when their feet were touched. Animals exposed
to air remained in good condition during exposure and upon re¬

showed no adverse effects from immersion in water of this
salinity. Others showed poor attachment, but upon return to
100% sea water, these animals all responded when their feet
