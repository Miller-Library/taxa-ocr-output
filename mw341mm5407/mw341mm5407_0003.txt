Ionic Fluctuation in Nuttallina californica
about ten to twenty hours a day(Ricketts and Calyjn,1968).
This study is an examination of the concentrations of four
inorganic cations in the hemolymph of Nuttallina californica
over a range of experimental salinities and in conditions of
exposure to air.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of Nuttallina californica were collected from
the eastern end of the Great Tidepool at Point Pinos, Monterey
County, California during the month of May, 1974. To minimize
possible intraspecific adaptive differences, the animals were
collected from a small area, all at approximately the same
vertical level,+3.5 to15.0 feet above the mean low-low tide.
The animals varied from 2.5 to 8 grams in weight. Ã„fter being
brought into the laboratory, they were placed in plastic tubs
in sea water of similar salinity, 33.97%, to that sampled at
