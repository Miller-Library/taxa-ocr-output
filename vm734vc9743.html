Abstract
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) have been found in measurable
amounts in receiving waters. These non-priority aquatic pollutants may act in unexpected and
potentially biohazardous ways. One of the more prevalent PPCPs is a perfume ingredient, musk
ketone (1-tert.-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-acetylbenzene). I tested musk ketone for its
ability to modulate the accumulation and efflux of xenobiotics known to be substrates of the
multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter using Corbicula fluminea, Lytechinus pictus, Mytilus
californianus, and Mytilus edulis. The multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter (MXR) is a
functional homologue of the mammalian multi-drug resistant transporter (MDR), a P-
glycoprotein. In aquatic systems, MXR serves as a first line of defense against an array of
lipophilic compounds. Musk ketone increased the accumulation of the MXR substrate

Introduction
The pervasive, slightly powdery musk scent in many commercial fragrances is due to a
synthetic nitro musk known as musk ketone (1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-
acetylbenzene) [fig. 1). It is the foundation for cosmetic, detergent, air freshener, etc. odor, and
an integral component of the fragrance industry. It is also a member of a group of non-priority
pollutants (Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products, PPCP) that has recently attracted a lot
of scientific and media attention because of their persistence in the aquatic environment
(Daughton and Ternes 1999). Because of their ability to resist biodegredation, the concern is that
aquatic organisms are being constantly exposed to PPCP, and that these compounds could
bioaccumulate through food chains.
Musk ketone was first identified in aquatic organisms in Japan in 1981 (Yamagishi et al
1981). In 1995, residue levels from 50.01 to 0.38mg of musk ketone/kg lipid from fish, mussels,
and shrimps were found from freshwater and marine sites near Germany (Rimkus and Wolf
1995). Nitro benzenoid musks were even observed in human adipose tissue and in breast milk
(Müller et al 1996). By 1998, musk ketone was beginning to be phased out of German
production and replaced by polycyclic musk fragrances, yet it was still found in measurable
amounts in suspended particulate matter (Winkler et al 1998). Fortunately, musk ketone alone,
in doses of 7.5 to 240mg/kg/day has no known significant effect on mammalian systems, but the
possible synergistic effects that musk ketone may have in conjunction with other aquatic
xenobiotics has not been thoroughly researched (Tas et al 1997).
Daughton and Ternes suggested a possible synergistic increase in PPCP toxicity through
an interaction with the multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter (1999). The multi-xenobiotic
resistance (MXR) mechanism, a homologue to the multi-drug resistance phenomenon seen in
mammalian systems, has been suggested as a first line of defense against xenobiotics in aquatic
organisms (Epel, 1998). True multi-xenobiotic transporters can efflux a variety of lipophilic
compounds from the cytosol and lipid membrane of a cell (Shapiro et al. 1997, Shapiro and Ling
1997, Endicott and Ling 1989). Certain substances—referred to as MXR modulators—interfere
with this efflux mechanism by binding to the MXR protein (Eytan et al 1996). This interference
prevents MXR from effluxing other environmental xenobiotics, and could heighten the effects of
these xenobiotics on the cell. Moderate hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, low molecular weight,
and the presence of a basic nitrogen atom characterize most MXR modulators. These properties
are also present in musk ketone. This suggests that musk ketone could be such a MXR
modulator.
Multidrug resistance in mammalian cells often coincides with a 170-KD membrane
glycoprotein (P170), a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) [fig. 21 (Morrow et al. 1988). There is an
immunologically similar protein present in aquatic organisms. Polyclonal antibodies raised
against hamster P170 cross-react with a similar membrane bound protein in marine organisms
(Waldmann et al 1995, Kurelec 1997). Since its discovery and the correlation between its
expression and the development of the MXR mechanism in various cells, this protein has become
synonymous with multi-xenobiotic/multi-drug resistance. In this study, I used the presence of
this protein to select the appropriate systems in which to study MXR. This immunologically
similar protein is seen in relatively high concentrations in the marine mussels Mytilus
californianus, and M. edulis used in this study, and relatively lower concentrations in the sea
urchin, Lytechinus pictus, and the fresh water clam, Corbicula fluminea also used in this work
(Cornwall et al 1995, Minier et al 1993, Narayanan 1999, Waldmann et al 1995)
In this study, 1 examined whether musk ketone was a substrate for the MXR transporter
and whether it enhanced the toxicity of other known MXR substrates using gill tissue from M.
californianus and C. fluminea, and the fertilized eggs of L. pictus and M. edulis. I found that
musk ketone significantly increases the accumulation of rhodamine B, a known MXR substrate,
in L. pictus, and M. californianus, and enhances the toxicity of vinblastine, another known MXR
substrate, in L. pictus. However, musk ketone did not seem to have an inhibitory effect on the
efflux of rhodamine B in M. californianus. These results suggest that musk ketone can have a
detrimental effect through enhancement of toxicity, but that the mechanism of this enhancement
is not through classical MXR transport.

Methods
The methods for studying rhodamine accumulation and efflux are modified versions of
procedures described by Cornwall et al 1995, and B. Kurelec et al in press.
Rhodamine Accumulation in Mytilus californianus and Corbicula fluminea Ifig. 31
Gill tissue was dissected out of either M. californianus or C. fluminea and placed in
filtered sea water (FSW)-or in the case of the clams, in filtered fresh water (FFW)-on ice. The
tissue was allowed to soak for at least ten minutes to allow excess mucus to flush out. Excess
mucus was removed using forceps. The gills were then cut, dorsal to ventral, using scissors, into
equal sizes as needed.
Prior to adding the gill tissue, petri dishes were set up containing the following final
concentrations in FSW solution for the mussel tissue, and in FFW solution for the clam tissue:
TuM rhodamine B only, 20uM verapamil/luM rhodamine B, varying concentrations of musk
ketone/luM rhodamine B, or varying concentrations of 1-heptanol/1uM rhodamine B.
4-7 pieces of gill tissue were placed into each petri dish and the petri dishes were
incubated at 15°C on an orbital shaker for 30-60 minutes. The tissue was then removed from
solution, rapidly washed with FSW (or FFW if clam gill tissue) for 20 seconds, and laid onto
microscope slides so that the gill tissue was flat with as little damage as possible. Tissues were
viewed within 5 minutes of removal from rhodamine B solution.
The fluorescence intensity of gill samples was measured using an epifluorescent
microscope with a rhodamine filter, a 16X objective, and a low light camera (Hamamatsu, model
C2400-08) linked to a PC with image analysis software (lmage-1). Images of tissue with as little
damage and mucus as possible were analyzed using Image-1. The relative fluorescence intensity
of a 200x200 pixel area was determined for each piece of gill tissue sampled.
Rhodamine Accumulation in Lytechinus pictus Ifig. 31
L. pictus spawning was induced with the injection of approximately O.1mL O.SM KCI
into the coelomic cavity. A 1% solution of eggs in FSW was fertilized with dry sperm. The 1%
solution was then separated into ImL aliquots in a 24-well plate. Into each well, the appropriate
amount of stock solution was added to create a final concentration of O.25uM rhodamine B only,
O.25uM rhodamine B/20 uM verapamil, 0.25 uM rhodamine B/5 uM musk ketone, or 0.25 uM
rhodamine B/1 mM 1-heptanol. The embryos were allowed to soak for one hour on an orbital
shaker at 15
At the end of the hour, a ImL aliquot for a given treatment was removed, washed with
FSW over a 30u nytex mesh (pores smaller than embryos). The FSW was allowed to drain out
of the mesh, leaving a more concentrated solution of embryos in FSW. Drops of the
concentrated solution were placed onto a microscope slide (no cover slip) and viewed under an
epifluorescent microscope with a rhodamine filter, a 16X objective, and a low light camera as
described in the gill accumulation assay. Images of fertilized eggs were analyzed using Image-1
as described in the accumulation assay in M. californianus. The relative fluorescence intensity of
a 40x40 pixel area was determined for each fertilized egg.
Efflux in Lytechinus pictus Ifig. 41
L. pictus were spawned as described in the accumulation assay and an approximately 1%
solution of L. pictus eggs in FSW was fertilized with dry sperm. Rhodamine B from the stock
solution was added to the solution to a final concentration of O.25uM rhodamine B. The
embryos were then incubated for 1 hour in a beaker on an orbital shaker at 15°C. Wash solutions
were then prepared and stored at room temperature: 5OmL FSW, 5OmL of 20uM verapamil,
50mL of 5uM musk ketone, and 50mL of 1mM 1-heptanol.
At the end of the hour, 4mL of the embryo solution was removed and washed with
approximately 15mL of the appropriate wash solution into a 30u nytex mesh as described in the
accumulation assay above. Äfter the wash solution drained from the mesh the embryos were
collected using a plastic pipette and re-suspended into 4mL of the corresponding wash solution.
This re-suspended solution was divided into ImL aliquots in a 24-well plate; 1mL for each time
point (0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes) and incubated on an orbital spinner at 15°C. At the appropriate
time point, an aliquot was removed and concentrated using the 30u nytex mesh as described in
the accumulation assay above. This concentrated solution was then placed onto a microscope
slide and examined using the same fluorescence analysis as for the accumulation assay.
Efflux in Mytilus californianus Ifig. 4
The gill tissue from M. californianus was prepared as in the accumulation assay. Enough
gill tissue (from 2-4 mussels) was cut so that each treatment and time point had at least 5
samples. All tissue was placed into petri dishes containing luM rhodamine B and incubated on
an orbital spinner at 15°C for one hour.
After the gill pieces were loaded with dye, they were removed from the rhodamine B
solution and washed with FSW for 10-20 seconds. Then, the tissue was placed into clean dishes
and incubated in various treatment solutions: FSW only; 5uM verapamil in FSW; 5uM musk
ketone in FSW; and 1mM 1-heptanol in FSW. The tissues were then incubated on an orbital
shaker at 15°C. Two methods were used to observe efflux. To examine long term efflux in 5-
minute (and longer) increments, gill pieces were removed from the treatments at the appropriate
time point, placed on microscope slides, and viewed under the fluorescence microscope as for the
accumulation assay. To examine short term efflux in 2-minute increments, images of the same
pieces of tissue per each time point were taken while the tissue remained in the treatment
solution.
The relative fluorescence intensity of a 200x200 pixel area was determined for all tissue
samples using the same equipment as described in the accumulation assay.
Toxicity Enhancement in Lytechinus pictus and Mytilus edulis Ifig. 51
L. pictus were spawned using the same techniques mentioned in the accumulation assay.
M. edulis spawning was induced through heat shocking by placing them into 27°C, UV-treated
FSW. Spawning time for M. edulis was variable; between 2-4 hours. For both L. pictus, and M.
edulis, a solution of approximately 1% eggs was fertilized and placed into a 24- well plate in
ImL aliquots. A different treatment combination from the stock solutions was added to each
aliquot to get the following final concentrations. The four controls contained FSW only (nothing
added), 20uM verapamil, luM musk ketone, or 5uM musk ketone. Then varying concentrations
of vinblastine were added singly and in combination with 20uM verapamil, luM musk ketone,
or 5uM musk ketone: for M. edulis concentrations of O.25uM, O.1uM, or O.05uM vinblastine
were used; and for L. pictus concentrations of 1 uM, 0.5 uM, or 0.25 uM vinblastine were used.
There were a total of 16 different treatment conditions for each assay.
The fertilized eggs were then incubated for 4 hours on an orbital spinner at 15°C. After
incubation, cell division was halted with the addition of 10OuL of 10% formaldehyde in FSW to
each ImL aliquot. 1-2 drops from each well were then placed onto a microscope slide with no
cover slip, and examined under a light microscope. At least 200 embryos were counted. For
each embryo, the number of cells was tallied as 1, 2, 4 or 8+ cells, and then averaged over the
total number of embryos counted.
Statistics
Accumulation and toxicity data were analyzed using ANÖVA to detect significant difference. A
Student-Newman-Keuls two-tailed test (« = 0.05) was used to determine which treatments were
significantly different. Efflux data was analyzed for equality of slopes using SYSTAT.
Results
Test Organisms
To examine the effects musk ketone on MXR transport, I needed test organisms with
easily obtainable tissue expressing the MXR protein. I chose M. californianus because of its
previous use as an ideal multi-xenobiotic test system, and M. edulis as a homologue to M.
californianus because of their easier spawning characteristics (Cornwall et al 1995). I used L.
pictus to compare the test results from <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus : Exact'>Mytilus</span> to another marine organism. I began testing on C.
fluminea because of its previous use as a test system, as well as its increased chance of higher
musk ketone exposure in freshwater environments (Waldmann et al 1995
Accumulation
For this study, I determined whether musk ketone was an inhibitor of MXR transport by
observing two pathways: accumulation and efflux. A MXR inhibitor would increase the
accumulation of a second MXR substrate by halting MXR active transport [fig. 31. In the
rhodamine B accumulation assay, I examined <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. fluminea gill</span> tissue, M. californianus gill tissue,
and L. pictus embryos for the accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence or absence of musk
ketone fig. 3). Rhodamine B accumulation was then observed as relative fluorescence intensity.
Accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence of 2uM musk ketone was seen in L. pictus
fertilized eggs, and M. californianus prepared gill tissue [graph 2, graph 31. Although increased
accumulation of rhodamine B in the presence of musk ketone in C. fluminea was seen, the
variability in the data was too great to draw any conclusions [graph 11.
In order to assess the effects of membrane perturbation, rhodamine B accumulation in M.
californianus was observed in the presence of two membrane-soluble alcohols: ethanol, and 1-
heptanol. Ethanol at 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% in FSW did not have an effect on rhodamine B
accumulation in M. californianus gill tissue, but accumulation of rhodamine B in in M.
californianus gill tissue soaked in 1-heptanol (1mM) was significantly greater than the
accumulation of rhodamine B in a rhodamine B only solution [graph 4, graph 51.
Efflux
According to the present MXR model, a MXR inhibitor would decrease the rate of efflux
of a second MXR substrate by halting MXR active transport [fig. 41. With MXR inhibition, the
substrate can only leave the cell by passive diffusion. In the efflux assay, I observed the rate of
rhodamine B efflux from L. pictus embryos, and M. californianus gill tissue in the presence or
absence of musk ketone. Musk ketone does not appear to slow efflux in M. californianus gill
tissue (graph 7]. The rate of efflux in L. pictus embryos, however, was highly variable [graph 61.
Embryos washed in 20uM verapamil, the known MXR inhibitor, appeared to be effluxing more
quickly than embryos washed in FSW, contrary to the basic premise of the efflux assay stable 21.
Toxicity Enhancement
The toxicity enhancement assay examined the same mechanism as the accumulation
assay fig. 5]. For the toxicity enhancement assay, I examined fertilized eggs from L. pictus, and
M. edulis for their ability to divide when exposed to vinblastine in the presence or absence of
musk ketone. Essentially, the toxicity assay indirectly measures the accumulation of vinblastine,
a compound that would inhibit cell division if allowed to accumulate in the cell, by observing the
average cell division. The mean number of cells per L. pictus embryo shows a clear depression
of cell division for embryos soaked in musk ketone (at luM and 5uM) plus vinblastine at O.5uM,
which suggests that musk ketone enhances the toxicity of vinblastine in L. pictus [graph 81.
However, the mean number of cells per M. edulis embryo does not show a clear depression of
cell division due to musk ketone exposure in the presence of vinblastine [graph 9]. Vinblastine
shows approximately the same level of toxicity in the presence or absence of musk ketone in M.
edulis embryos.
Statistics for Accumulation and Toxicity Enhancement
Single-factor ANÖVA was used to identify significant interaction among treatments
table 1]. Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to show non-significant groups [figure 6, figure
71.
Discussion and Future Directions
The results for this study were surprising on many levels. First, there was a species
variability in their accumulation and efflux response in the presence of musk ketone. This study
also revealed musk ketone's asymmetrical effects on MXR.
Species Variability
The prevailing theory of MXR activity correlates MXR protein concentration (P¬
glycoprotein) with the ability to efflux a substrate; a cell line containing a high concentration of
MXR protein would be expected to efflux a larger amount of substrate. This would also imply
that a cell line containing a high concentration of MXR protein would require a higher
concentration of MXR inhibitor to elicit the same level of response seen in a cell line containing
a relatively lower concentration of MXR protein. However, I occasionally observed increased
accumulation of rhodamine B in C. fluminea in the presence of 20uM musk ketone sdata not
shown), a much higher concentration of musk ketone than required for a similar response in M.
californianus (increased accumulation at 2-5 uM). This was surprising because C. fluminea
contains relatively little MXR protein (Pgp) compared to M. californianus [western blots
conducted, but data not shown).
Assuming musk ketone acts on MXR in both organisms, these results might simply
reflect the variability of MXR substrate specificity for marine and fresh water organisms. The
substrate binding properties of musk ketone probably might change in fresh water and seawater,
which would cause a difference in the level of rhodamine B accumulation. Another hypothesis is
that musk ketone is not acting on MXR in both or either of these organisms. C. fluminea might
express relatively low concentrations of MXR protein because it utilizes an alternative pathway
to efflux xenobiotics.
Another instance of variable musk ketone activity among species is the difference in L.
pictus and M. edulis embryo response to the toxicity of vinblastine in the presence of musk
ketone. Again, MXR protein concentration should correlate to a cell line’s ability to efflux a
substrate in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. Higher MXR protein concentration should
correlate with an increase in the difference between accumulation of a substrate in the presence
or absence of an inhibitor. In the accumulation assays, M. californianus, the homologue to M.
edulis, showed a much greater response to the presence of musk ketone than L. pictus [graph 2,
graph 3]. However, in the toxicity assays, L. pictus showed a much greater response to the
presence of musk ketone than M. edulis. This variable response was unexpected because Mytilus
contains relatively higher amounts of MXR protein than L. pictus (Cornwall et al 1995,
Narayanan 1999).
Non-symmetrical Effect
This study indicates that musk ketone is not a classical inhibitor for the MXR efflux
transport, but is acting through an undetermined, alternative pathway to increase the
accumulation of MXR substrates. A classical inhibitor (like verapamil) would show increased
accumulation of rhodamine B and slowed efflux of rhodamine B in the presence of an inhibitor.
Musk ketone acted asymmetrically by increasing rhodamine B accumulation without decreasing
rhodamine B efflux. This increase in accumulation due to the presence of musk ketone was even
verified by the toxicity enhancement assay.
There were many logistical problems with the efflux assay, as seen in the high variability
of the results. I recommend that the assay be refined further before it can be used as a conclusive
way of determining the effects of a compound on rhodamine B efflux. It is possible that musk
ketone did slow rhodamine B efflux and I was unable to detect that result due to experimental
error. However, the efflux assay was repeated on M. californianus multiple times, and musk
ketone efflux tended to mimic the rate of efflux of rhodamine B in FSW more often than the
efflux rate in verapamil although those results could not be statistically supported.
Alternative Hypothesis and Preliminary Testing
Assuming that musk ketone does not slow efflux, musk ketone must be acting on an
alternative pathway to increase accumulation of MXR substrates without decreasing their rate of
efflux. Ferté suggested alternative points of interaction between the potential inhibitor and MXR
besides an inhibitor to protein interaction. The MXR inhibitor could be changing how the MXR
protein (Pgp) is configured in the membrane, changing how the substrate (e.g. rhodamine B)
interacts with the lipid membrane, or the proposed inhibitor could be acting on an entirely
different transporter or channel (2000).
I began preliminary tests for the relationship between accumulation/efflux and lipid
membrane perturbation. Musk ketone might integrate into the lipid bilayer and create pores that
could increase the amount of rhodamine B accumulation into the lipid bilayer, but would not
prevent rhodamine B efflux. I used ethanol and 1-heptanol to see if they would act to perturb the
membrane and result in an increase in accumulation, but not efflux. Ethanol did not affect
accumulation (Graph 4).
Initial testing with 1-heptanol-which is known to disrupt the core and surface of spinal
neuron membranes-seemed promising <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tapia : Exact'>(Tapia</span> et al 1998). ImM 1-heptanol does cause a
significant increase in accumulation, but it also causes a significant decrease in efflux. This was
surprising because 1-heptanol does not share many of the characteristics of a MXR substrate. As
these results are preliminary, further refining must be done before any definitive conclusions may
be drawn.
Future Directions
The results of this study point in many future research directions. I recommend that any
attempts to recreate this experiment also include a correlation between relative Pgp concentration
and the accumulation and efflux activity. As the discussion over the species variability shows,
this correlation might account for the variability among species to interfere with determining the
activity of MXR. I would also recommend the pursuit and expansion of the initial 1-heptanol
tests. It would be interesting to see how other known membrane disrupters affect accumulation
and efflux through a systematic look at different anesthetics that often operate through membrane
perturbation. Examination of the MXR effects of musk xylene and other similar synthetic musks
would also be productive.
Another avenue for research would be to repeat this experiment using mammalian
systems. These results strongly suggest that musk ketone may enhance the toxicity of other
compounds, and recent research has shown that musk ketone is already present in alarming
amounts in mammalian environments and organisms (Müller et al 1996). These factors make
research into the possible effects musk ketone may have on mammalian systems imperative.
Further research into this area would also bring the analogies between the less understood aquatic
MXR and the more understood mammalian MDR closer. This would help further the
understanding of the MXR mechanism.
Finally, further research must be done on the subtle effects pharmaceuticals and
personal care products have on the aquatic environment. As seen in this study, musk ketone-a
compound used ubiquitously in everyday products--enhances the accumulation and, therefore,
toxicity of other compounds in marine organisms. However, musk ketone is only one of the
pharmaceuticals and personal care products that exist in treated water. Given their proven
durability, their pervasive production and use, and the preliminary indication of their
bioaccumulation, we cannot afford to ignore the PPCP's possible synergistic effects on the
environment and, ultimately, us.

Legend
Fig. 1: MXR protein. This is a hypothetical structure for the P-glycoprotein that is probably
responsible for the multi-drug/multi-xenobiotic resistance. There are three glycosylation sites in
the first outside segment, 12 transmembrane regions, and two cytosolic ATP-binding sites.
Fig. 2: Musk Ketone. Note the aromatic structure, the amino groups.
Fig. 3: Accumulation Assay. Used to observe the qualitative increase in rhodamine B
accumulation. Dots represent rhodamine B. Arrows show the flow of rhodamine B into and out
of cells.
Fig. 4: Efflux Assay. Used to observe the qualitative rate of rhodamine B efflux from cells.
Dots represent rhodamine B. Arrows show the flow of rhodamine B into and out of cells.
Fig. 5: Toxicity Enhancement Assay. Used to observe the effect vinblastine has on dividing
cells in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. Eight cell stage illustrated on left. Single cell
stage illustrated on right.
Fig. 6: Student-Newman-Kuels test used to find statistical differences in accumulation between
specific treatment groups. Treatments were sorted by means in descending values. Bars indicate
statistically non-significant groups.
Fig. 7: Student-Newman-Kuels test used to find statistical differences between treatments in the
toxicity enhancement assay. FSW = fresh sea water, VER = verapamil, VIN = vinblastine, MK1
- musk ketone (luM), MK5 = musk ketone (SuM). The number listed on the second row is the
concentration of vinblastine present in the combination. The treatments are listed in descending
order by mean values of average number of cells per treatment. Bars indicate no significant
difference.
Graph 1: Accumulation in C. fluminea. Relative fluorescence intensity is listed on the Y-axis
for each treatment listed in the legend. The error bars are for the variability among the gill tissue
of 6 clams. Although (1) and (II) depict different concentrations, the problems with variability
are clear.
Graph 2: Accumulation in L. pictus. Relative fluorescence is listed on the Y-axis against the
treatments listed on the X-axis. The standard error shown is for a sample of 30 embryos per
treatment.
Graph 3: Accumulation of Rhodamine in M. californianus. The relative fluorescence intensity
is shown on the Y-axis and the treatments are listed on the X-axis for two mussel samples. The
standard error is shown for the variability within an individual mussel’s gill tissue.
Graph 4: Accumulation in M. californianus in the Presence of Ethanol. Relative fluorescence is
listed on the Y-axis for each treatment listed in the legend. The error bars are for 6 gill pieces
from a single mussel.
Graph 5: Accumulation in M. californianus in the Presence of 1-Heptanol. Relative
fluorescence intensity is listed on the Y-axis against the treatments on the X-axis. The standard
error is for the variation among the gill tissue of a single mussel.
Graph 6: Efflux in L. pictus. The log of the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI), on the Y-axis,
was measured at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The individual data points are not shown. The lines
shown are the best fit linear regression of the collective data for any individual treatment as listed
in the legend.
Graph 7: Efflux in M. californianus. The log of relative fluorescence intensity on the Y-axis
was calculated for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minute time-points. The individual data points are not
shown. The lines shown are the best fit linear regression of the data for an individual treatment
listed in the legend.
Graph 8: Toxicity Enhancement Assay in L. pictus. The number of cells per embryo was
averaged for at least 200 embryos. The legend lists the concentrations for each bar graph. FSW
fresh seawater, Ver = verapamil, K = musk ketone, Vin = vinblastine. Vinblastine
concentration decreases in the direction of the arrows.
Graph 9: Toxicity Enhancement Assay in M. edulis. The number of cells per embryo was
averaged for at least 200 embryos. The legend lists the concentrations for each bar graph. FSW
= fresh seawater, Ver = verapamil, K = musk ketone, Vin = vinblastine. Vinblastine
concentration decreases in the direction of the arrows.
