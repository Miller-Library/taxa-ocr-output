Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 5
methods tried were the following (M.1.- Mopalia lignosa,
M.m.- Mopalia muscosa. Numerals preceding these indicate
numbers tested):
1. Dilation of gonopores by insertion of glass probe,
followed by placement of animals in standing seawater;
2 M.1., 1 M.m. No spawning in 1 hour.
Ref. Gould (1967) for Urechis.
Electrical stimulation of gonopores (15v Q 50 cycles AC
2.
for 5 sec.) followed by placement in standing seawater;
3 M.1., 2 M.m. No spawning in 1.5 hours.
Ref. Iwata (1950) for Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758.
3. Electrical stimulation of exposed lateral nerve cord
(15v 2 50 cycles AC for 5 sec.) followed by placement in
standing seawater; 1 M.1., 1 M.m. No spawning in 1 hour.
Ref. Harvey (1956) for echinoids.
Injection of 0.2ml 0.5M KCl into perivisceral hemocoel
or through pallial groove followed by placement in stand-
ing seawater; 3 M.1., 3 M.m. Caused strong body contraction
in 3 minutes but no spawning in 4 hours.
Ref. Harvey (1939) for echinoids.
Injection of nerve tissue homogenate into perivisceral
hemocoel, followed by placement in standing seawater;
1 M.m. No spawning in 1 hour.
Ref. Davis, Mpitsos, and Pinneo (1973) for Pleurobranchaea.
Eggs dissected from ovaries and treated for one hour
with Zml O.1N NaOH in 100ml seawater, inseminated with
sperm obtained by dissection; 1 M.1., 1 M.m, Eggs not
fertilizable with active sperm.
Ref. Wolfsohn (1907) for Acmaea.
