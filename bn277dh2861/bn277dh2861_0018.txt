Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 19
spectively. For the remainder of development, M. lignosa
adheres to a schedule 4 days ahead of that for M. muscosa.
A major difference in the development of these three
species of Mopalia is in the ontogeny of the plates. Thorpe
(1962) states that "the anterior valves are the first to be
apparent" in M. ciliata. In both M. lignosa and M. muscosa,
the cephalic plate did not form until after the appearance
of the plates posterior to it. The caudal plate in M. ciliata
develops on the 8th day (Thorpe, 1962). In contrast, in both
M. lignosa and M. muscosa the caudal plated doest appear
until the 6th week.
Mopalia lignosa and M. muscosa show sequences of devel-
opmental events similar to those of the few other chitons
studied. The major differences appear in the timing rather
than the nature or order of events. Tonicella lineata,
according to Barnes (1972), hatches at 2 days and the larvae
settle at 3 days. Christiansen (1954) reported that
Lepidopleurus asellus hatched at 20 to 21 hours and settled
at about 10 days. Heath (1899) reported a period of 7 days
between fertilizationand hatching in Ischnochiton magdalenensis
(- Stenoplax heathiana). Okuda (1947) noted that
Cryptochiton stelleri did not hatch until 70 hours or more
after fertilization. The larvae emerged with external
features which did not develop in M. lignosa and M. muscosa
until the later free-swimming stages. Settling in Cryptochiton
began 12 to 20 hours after hatching and liberation from
the jelly mass.
