Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 20
A curious feature is the placement of the larval eye.
In spiralian development, larval eyes usually occur anterior
to the prototroch. The larval eyes of chitons are located
more posteriorly, behind the head region proper. They
apparently still serve a sensory function, since they are
innervated by the pallial nerve cord (Heath, 1904). Heath
(1904) puts forth the following interesting hypothesis:
"Now it is obvious that if the chiton eye
were situated in front of the velum, as in
the annelids, it would be most unfavorably
placed after metamorphosis. Under the cir-
cumstances the most available situation would
be the furrow about the proboscis, where it
would be continually obscured and would be
practically useless even if provided with
tentacles. It seems most reasonable to suppose
that as the structures characteristic of
the chitons appeared in the phylogenetic
development, the eye-spots gradually shifted
their position into the present more favorable
location.
SUMMARY
1. Spawning behavior and external features of the larval
development were studied in the chitons' Mopalia muscosa
and M. lignosa during the months of April-June, 1974, at
Pacific Grove, California.
