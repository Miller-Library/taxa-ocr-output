Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 17
SETTLING STIMULI
Metamorphosis in both Mopalia lignosa and Mopalia muscosa
was delayed or prevented by the lack of an appropriate
settling substratum. Only two larvae out of several hundred
observed underwent complete metamorphosis on glass.
In Mopalia lignosa, fully metamorphosed juveniles (shell
plates present, no apical tuft, no prototroch cilia) appeared
by seven days after fertilization when water-worn Mytilus
shells with a film of microscopic algae were added 4.5 days
after fertilization. In a bowl left without shells for 14
days, the apical tuft was still present and no shell plates
had appeared,though most of the larvae had lost their proto-
troch cilia and had been crawling 6 days after fertilization.
When Mytilus shells were added on day 14, fully metamorphosed
juveniles were noted within a day.
Similarly, no substratum was added to three bowls contain-
ing seawater and Mopalia muscosa larvae, while pieces of
Mytilus shell with an algal film were added to another three
such bowls at 5 days after fertilization. In the bowls with-
out the shells, only two larvae ever formed dorsal plates.
The rest apparently stopped development, retained the proto-
troch cilia and never metamorphosed; all subsequently died
14 to 17 days after fertilization. Development in the bowls
with Mytilus shell
progressed normally.
The advantage of a substrate-sensitive settling response
is clear. The ability to delay metamorphosis until a suit-
