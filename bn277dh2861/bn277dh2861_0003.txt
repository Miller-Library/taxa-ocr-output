Development in Mopalia
O.3ml of a mixture of 0.5g streptomycin and 300,000 units
of penicillin in one liter of distilled water was added to
the bowls to control bacterial growth. Water in the bowls
was changed by decanting off about one-half the volume of
water and pouring the remainder of the culture, containing
nearly all the larvae, into a clean finger bowl. This was
done every ?4 hours for the first 12 hours of development
and twice daily for the later stages. The finger bowls
were covered with glass plates and maintained partially
immersed in running sea water at 13.5-15.8Â°0. Around the
time of settling, eroded fragments-of Mytilus shell covered
with a green algal film were added to most of the bowls as
a settling surface.
Observations of the structure and behavior of living
larvae were made in finger bowls under a dissecting microscope
and in wet whole mounts under a compound microscope. For
permanent whole mounts, larvae were fixed in Bouin's fluid
and stained in dilute acidulated Grenacher's borax carmine
(Galigher and Kozloff, 1964). Due to the large amount of
yolk in the larvae, little internal differentiation could be
discerned.
SPAWNING
To obtain gametes, attempts were made to induce
spawning in the laboratory using methods which have produced
positive results in gastropods and other invertebrates. The
