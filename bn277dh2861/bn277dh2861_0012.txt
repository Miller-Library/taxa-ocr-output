chorion. The vitelline membrane of an unfertilized egg lies
in close proximity to the chorion (Figure 2 A). A few minutes
after fertilization, a gap was visible between the egg and
chorion (Figure 2 B). Cleavage followed the typical spiral
pattern (Figure 2 C-F). Division after the fourth cleavage
and gastrulation were not followed in detail. The first
prototroch cilia were seen at 10 hours and the ciliated ring
appeared complete 12 hours after fertilization (Figure 2 G).
The cilia beat slowly and feebly at first, but their movements
increased in frequency and amplitude until hatching at 20
hours (Figure 2 H), when their action was sufficiently power-
ful to break away pieces of the chorion as the trochophore
emerged. The trochophore larvae usually hatched with the
apical tuft foremost, but some emerged with part of the
prototroch first.
Free Swimming Trochophore
The trochophores were roughly egg-shaped with the
prototroch a little above the equator (Figure 2 I). The
apical tuft, developed prior to hatching, was surrounded
by a field of smaller somatic cilia. A similar field of
teleotrochal somatic cilia occupied the posterior end (Figure
2 J). These two patches of somatic cilia expanded anteriorly
and posteriorly until they surrounded the body at 5.5 days.
The larval eyes, two red pigmented spots embedded in the
epithelium covering the body, appeared laterally just
