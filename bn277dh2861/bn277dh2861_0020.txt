Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 21
2. Specimens of M. lignosa spawned in the lab after several
hours in containers of standing seawater. Males moved
around during spawning while females remained stationary.
3. Electrical stimulation, injection of O.5M KCl or homo-
genate of nervous tissue failed to induce spawning.- Eggs
obtained through dissection were unfertilizable, even after
treatment with 3ml of O.1N NaoH in 100ml seawater.
4. The sequence of events in the development of the two
species is the same, though some differences in timing
exist. First cleavage, second cleavage, third cleavage,
and hatching occurrdat about 1 hr., 1.5 hrs., 2.5 hrs., and
20 hrS.,respectively, in both species.
5. After hatching,the larvae of both species swam freely
for a period. M. lignosa settled about 5.5 days after
fertilization and M. muscosa about 11.5 days after fert-
ilization. During the free-swimming period,the larval
eyes, mantle and foot developed.
6. Larvae were considered settled when the prototroch cilia
were no longer present, and metamorphosed when the shell
plates appeared and the apical tuft was lost. This happened
at 6.5 days for M. lignosa and 13.5 days for M. muscosa.
The shell plates of M. muscosa appeareto develop in the
following order: 2, 3, 1a4, 5, 6, 7, 8. No such sequence
was noted for M. lignosa. The caudal plate in both species
did not form until about 6 weeks after fettilization.
7. Both species seemedto exhibit a substrate-sensitive
