Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 3
comparisons between the two would be valid and clear. The
work was carried out at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University during the months of April-June, 1974.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Specimens of Mopalia lignosa were collected under low
rocks at Mission Point, Carmel Bay, California. M. muscosa
were collected at the same location and from rocks in the
mid-tide zone of Point Pinos, Pacific Grove, California.
Heath (1905, p. 392) maintains that Katharina tunicata
(Wood, 1815) attains sexual maturity at two years, reaches
a length of 25mm the firstyear and adds 8-11mm the second
year. He states that this is also characteristic of both
M. lignosa and M. muscosa, therefore only larger animals
(50-60mm long) were taken, to insure sexual maturity.
Once in the laboratory, the chitons were maintain√©d in
circulating seawater aquaria.
Embryos were reared in 5-inch finger bowls cleaned
with concentrated nitric acid followed by detergent and
thorough rinsing. Fertilized eggs were pipetted from the
aquaria (see Spawning), rinsed in fresh sea water several
times and placed in thin layers in bowls with one-half-inch
of sea water. Both natural sea water filtered through coarse
filter paper and artificial sea water (Instant Ocean Synthetic
Sea Salts) were used. Little difference was found between
the two and only filtered natural sea water was used for
embryos from the late free-swimming stage on. From 0.1 to
