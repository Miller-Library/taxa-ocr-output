Development in Mopalia

and expanded laterally to completely obscure the body (Figure
1 V-W). A small pallial groove was formed (Figure 1 W), but
no ctenidia were present. These began appearing approximately
8 weeks after fertilization, the posterior-most ones beling
formed first. By this time the larval eyes had disappeared.
The eight (caudal) plate formed approximately 6 weeks after
fertilization.
Foot Development
The foot began to form on the ventral surface of the
body, just posterior to the prototroch and the mouth (Figure
1 M), about 4.5 days after fertilization. Within a day it
was well-differentiated, and a heavily ciliated flap appeared
at its anterior margin (Figure 1 0-P). Whether or not this
structure aided in early feeding was not determined.
Approximately five days after fertilization,the larvae
began to spend increasing amountsof time crawling on the
bottom rather than swimming with their still-present proto-
trochs. This was accompanied by a dorso-ventral flattening
of the body. The crawling larvae often attached with the
posterior end of the foot and waved their free anterior end
from side to side. They used the anterior portion of the
foot to gain firmer attachment when needed. Once the proto-
troch cilia disappeared, the larvae became permanent crawlers
and apparently began feeding, crawling slowly forward while
moving their heads from side to side. Dark material became
visable in the central region of the body.
