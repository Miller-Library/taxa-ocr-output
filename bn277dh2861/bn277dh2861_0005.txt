Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 6
7. Several ml sperm solution obtained from dissected male
gonad added to aquaria containing chitons; 7 M.1., 5 M.m.
No spawning in 5 hours. Ref. Heath (1905) that sperm re-
leased by males may cause female spawning.
8.
Water in tank containing chitons allowed to stand and
become stale. Temperature slightly elevated (15°c.):
7 M.1., 7 M.m. Spawning occurred though not consistently.
Ref. Grave (1932) for Chaetopleura apiculata (Say).
Still water at temperatures slightly above ambient
ocean temperature seem to be common conditions for natural
spawning. Ishnochiton magdalenensis (- Stenoplax heathiana
Berry, 1946) was observed spawning in tide pools during
early morning low tides (Heath, 1899, p. 5). Grave (1932)
and Christiansen (1954) obtained spawning in Chaetopleura
apiculata and Lepidopleurus ascellus (Spengler),
respectively, by allowing them to sit in non-circulating sea
water at slightly elevated temperatures for several hours.
While similar conditions were present when Mopalia lignosa
spawned in the lab, these conditions were not sufficient for
consistent release of gametes. Male and female Mopalia
muscosa spawned together on one occasion in a tank with
circulating seawater at a temperature of approximately 13°c.
Isolated females spawned in finger bowls in which the water
had been allowed to stand for a day. Thus, no coherent
pattern of spawning conditions could he established.
