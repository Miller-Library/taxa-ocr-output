Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 15
(Figure 2 M), and the latter formed more regular rows,except
in the posterior region. The mantle field continued to
expand, and by 11.5 days had extended over the posterodorsal
head region. Mantle growth on the head was accompanied by
the loss of the prototroch (Figure 2 P).
Shell plate formation began around 135 days with the de-
position of seven thin lines of opaque material along the
transverse grooves of the mantle field (Figure 20). During
their early development, the order of size from the largest
to the smallest (counting the cephalic plate as number one)
was 2, 3, (4,1), 5, 6, 7 (Figure 2 0). This order suggests
the sequence of development. Enlargement of the plates conÂ¬
tinued until they came into mutual contact and extended
laterally to the ring of spicules around the mantle field
(Figure 2 R-Y). The mantle field itself extended until the
rest of the larva was completely hidden. The eighth (caudal)
plate did not form until approximately 6 weeks after fert-
ilization. Ctenidia began to form in the pallial groove about
two weeks after this, the posterior-most ones being the first
to develop.
Foot Development
The foot began to form during the free swimming stage
(6.5 days). It gradually extended as a ventral bulge, and
a conspicuous ciliated flap formed on the anterior edge of
the foot on the seventh day (Figure 2 N). By the tenth day,
