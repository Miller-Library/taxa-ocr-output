Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 16
the foot was well formed.
Development of the foot was accompanied by a gradual
change in locomotion. The 3-day larvae swam rapidly, preÂ¬
dominantly near the surface. However, at 6 days,they began
to spend more time on the bottom, occasionally adhering to
it with their posterior ends. Here they swung freely from
the point of attachment or rotated due to prototrochal action
for 1 to 2 seconds; then either they were knocked loose by
movement of water in the bowl or freed themselves by swim-
ming action of the prototroch. Once freed,they resumed swimming.
As the foot developed further, the trochophores spent increas-
ing periods of time on the bottom. At 9 or 10 days,they
attached to the bottom by both the anterior and posterior
ends of the foot and rocked from side to side from these
two points. Their prototrochs were noticeably smaller and
had disappeared by 12.5 days. The larvae were then considered
being
"settled".

Head Development
External differentiation of the head was minimal until

the disappearance of the apical tuft at 11.5 days,,about the
same time as first deposCition of the shell plates. As the
mantle field extended, the head became flattened and was soon
covered by the mantle dorsally (Figure 2 V). Radular move-
ments were observed in the mouth at 21 days.
