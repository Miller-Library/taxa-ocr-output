Free Swimming Trochophore
The newly hatched trochophores were broadly egg-shaped
with the protrochal band encircling the body at its greatest
girth. Several long cilia at the anterior end of the body, which
make up the apical tuft, were present at or before hatching
(Figure 1 I). The apical tuft was surrounded by a field of
much shorter cilia. A similar teleotrochal field of short
cilia occurred around the posterior end of the body (Figure
1 I). By the third day after fertilization these fields
had expanded to cover the body of the trochophore. About
this same time the larval eyes appeared as simple pigment
spots on the lateral margins of the body just posterior to
the prototroch. They persisted until well after metamorphosis.
The prototrochal cilia beat such that the body was
continually rotating around its axis in a clockwise direction
when viewed from the anterior end. Sometimes the larvae halt-
ed their rapid swimming and hovered in a head-up position,
maintaining their places in the water column with the slow
beat of the prototrochal cilia. The apical tuft appeared
in part to serve a sensory function, for when Ã¥ swimming
larva contacted an obstacle with it, it backed away and swam
in another direction.
