Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 12
Head Development
At hatching, the head region was clearly marked off
by the prototroch. In the free-swimming trochophore, it was
relatively undifferentiated, its most prominent feature being
the apical tuft (Figure 1 I). As the foot and mantle formed,
it became more flattened (Figure 1 R). Our studies did not
determine whether the mantle grew forward over the head, or
if the head itself formed new mantle tissue. At about 6.5
days, a groove appeared along the mid-ventral line of the head.
being wider at the prototroch and tapering anteriorly (Figure
1 P). Its function was not determined. By 18 days after
fertilization,the head had attained essentially its adult
form (Figure 1 W). Feeding motions of the radula were ob-
served under a compound microscope at this time.
By 8 weeks after fertilization, the juvenile chitons
had all the features of an adult: eight shell plates were
present, the girdle margin had grown out from under the plates
and was covered with spicules, ctenidia had begun to form,
and the larval eyes had disappeared.
DEVELOPMENT OF MOPALIA MUSCOSA
A schedule of development and illustrations of the
various stages appear in Table I and Figure 2. Further
details on the ontogeny of form and behavior are given below.
Early Development
The eggs of Mopalia muscosa are either green or golden
brown, 0.29mm in diameter, and are encased in a bristly
