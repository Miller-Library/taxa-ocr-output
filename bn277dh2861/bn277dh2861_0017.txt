Development in Mopalia

able substratum is present increases the chances that larvae
will settle under conditions favorable for post-larval
development. Such a settling response has been shown to
exist in Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815) by Barnes (1972) and
was briefly mentioned by Heath (1899, pp. 62-63) for
Stenoplax heathiana. It has also been found in other molluscs
(Bayne, 1964; Thompson, 1964; Swennen, 1961; and Scheltema,
1961), as well as in other invertebrate groups.
DISCUSSION
Mopalia muscosa and Mopalia lignosa, while similar in
many aspects of development, show some differences, particular¬
ly in the timing of events. They are compared below to each
other, to Mopalia ciliata for which some details are available
(Thorpe, 1962), and to a few more distantly related species.
Development from cleavage through hatching takes place
at similar rates in Mopalia lignosa and M.muscosa, and at
13°C.,the larvae hatch roughly 20 hours after fertilization.
Development of M. ciliata at "normal ocean temperature" is
a little slower, and the larvae hatch 36-42 hours after fert-
ilization (Thorpe, 1962). Structures arising during the free-
swimming stage appear within 2 days of each other in M. lignosa
and M. muscosa; details are not available for M. ciliata.
Settling can be contrasted in all three species: M. lignosa
loses its prototroch cilia at about 5.5 days, while M. ciliata
and M. muscosa lose theirs on the 8th and ilth days, re-
