Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 7
Thorpe (1962) reports that Mopalia muscosa and Mopalia
lignosa may spawn in the lab at times corresponding to
certain phases of the local tidal cycle. We could not
resolve any such correlation.
Detailed observations of spawning behavior were made
only for Mopalia lignosa. In two instances, once in the
late afternoon and once at night, 7 to 10 chitons placed
in a large plastic dishepan partially filled with non-
circulating seawater spawned after several hours. The pan
was tilted so that the water reached only part way up the
inclined bottom. During spawning, the girdle was elevated
anteriorly and postero-laterally. In both sexes the posterior
tip of the girdle margin was raised to form a spout through
which a single stream of gametes was released. The four
males observed spawning were more active than females during
the process. They released intermittent spurts of sperm
in long, thin streams which pooled in masses at the bottom
of the tank and diffused into the water only slowly.
The duration of each continuous sperm release was 3-5
minutes, separated by intervals of 5-15 minutes. Two of
the three females observed spawning were partially out of
water, with only their posterior ends submerged; all remained
stationary. Eggs flowed slowly out in single file,
loosely held together by a thin mucus sheath, and piled
up behind the animal.
