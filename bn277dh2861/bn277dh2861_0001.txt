Development in Mopalia
INTRODUCTION
The genus Mopalia (Mollusca, Polyplacophora) is
represented by 14 species along the California coast
(Burghardt and Burghardt, 1969). Among the common forms
in central California are Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846),
Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1846), Mopalia ciliata (Sowerby,
1840), and Mopalia hindsii (Reeve, 1847). Though rela-
tively well known taxonomically, little is known of the
spawning behavior and larval development of this genus.
Heath (1905) made brief mention of spawning in M. lignosa
and M. muscosa in the field. Thorpe (1962) studied spawning
in M. lignosa, M. muscosa, M. ciliata, M. hindsii,
M. imporcata (Carpenter in Pilsbry, 1892), and M. porifera
(Pilsbry, 1892). He also made some general observations
on the larval development of M. ciliata. Comparable
information on larval development in other species of
this genus is not available. We chose to study development
in M. muscosa and M. lignosa in part to fill this gap and
because these species are common and known to spawn in the
spring (Heath, 1899; Boolootian, 1964). Our aim was to
determine the main sequence of events in larval development
and its time schedule. The development of M. muscosa was
followed by Cox, while that of M. lignosa was followed by
Watanabe. A strong effort was made to standardize ex-
perimental procedures and presentation of results so that
