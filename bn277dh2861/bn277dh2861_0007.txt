Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 8
Small disturbances, including a brief removal from
water, interrupted but did not permanently stop spawning.
Thorpe (1962) reported that in his experience only the
close proximity of a strong, hot light would halt spawning:
agitation and inversion of the animals would not.
DEVELOPMENT OF MOPALIA LIGNOSA
A time schedule of development for Mopalia lignosa
is given in Table I. The various stages of development
are shown in Figure 1.
Early Development
The eggs were light green and about 0.2mm in diameter.
They were very yolky and were surrounded by a transparent,
frilly chorion (Figure 1 A). Once fertilization occurred, a
small space appeared between the egg and the chorion (Figure
1 B). Cleavage was typically spiral (Figure 1 C-F).
Gastrulation begins with an invagination of the macro-
meres (Heath, 1899, p. 50). A slight invagination was
observed in several embryos 10-12 hours after fertilization
but was never positively identified as the blastopore.
Beating of the prototrochal cilia began about 12 hours
after fertilization. Just before hatching (19 hours), the
strongly beating cilia stopped for several minutes. When
beating resumed, small portions of the chorion broke away
and the trochophore struggled out anterior end first using
both muscular contractions of the body and ciliary beat (FigÂ¬
ure 1 H). The hatching process occupied approximately 5
