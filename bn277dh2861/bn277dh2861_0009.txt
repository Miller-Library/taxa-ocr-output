Development in Mopalia
(Middendorff, 1846), appeared scattered over the dorsal body
surface 2 to 3 days after fertilization (Figure 1 K-L).
Shortly after this, a series of alternating ridges and
grooves, transversely oriented, began forming on the dorsal
surface. Five days after fertilization, eight ridges and
seven grooves were present. The large cells became aligned
along the tops of the ridges (Figure 1 M-N). This system
of ridges and grooves marked the site of the developing mantle.
By 4.5 days, the mantle field had become well-delineated by
the mantle fold (Figure 1 M). Short spicules appeared first
at the anterior margin of the mantle and by six days after
fertilization they completely encircled it (Figure 1 Q-R).
Herein, the term "settled" refers to larvae which have
lost the prototrochal cilia and become permanent crawlers.
"Metamorphosed" refers to larvae which have lost the apical
tuft and have shell plates forming.
As the larvae began to settle (5.5 days), the head
became partially covered by the mantle field. The shell
plates first appeared after about 6.5 days. Plates 2-7
(counting the cephalic or head plate as number one), the
first to form, appeared as thin, opaque slivers in the grooves
between successive dorsal ridges(Figure 1 0). The cephalic
plate formed a day later, by which time the apical tuft had
disappeared. The seven plates enlargedanteriorly and post-
eriorly until they overlapped one another (Figure 1 S-U).
