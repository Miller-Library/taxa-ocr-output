Development in Mopalia
Watanabe and Cox - 14
posterior to the prototroch at 3.5 days, and were still
visible at 32 days (Figure 2 J-Y). In swimming,the larvae
rotated continuously in a clockwise direction (as viewed
anteriorly); their bodies oriented vertically with the apical
tuft up when hovering. Swimming of a larva was interrupted
only when it ran into another larva or the side of the bowl,
which caused an asynchronous beat. Ciliary action then stopped
for less than a second and resumed slowly. Larvae usually
swam along the bottom with the apical tuft in front, randomly
moving both horizontally and vertically, but only occasionally
swimming to the surface.
Mantle and Shell Development
The post-trochal region appeared elongated at 3.5
days (Figure 2 J). About 5 days after fertilization,it
began to flatten dorso-ventrally, and large cells appeared,
forming irregular rows on the dorsal surface (Figure 2 K).
This was also reported by Heath (1899) in Stenoplax heathiana
and by Okuda (1947) in Cryptochiton stelleri. A row of
short, pointed spicules then formed anterior to the proto-
troch, and extended almost entirely across the dorsal surface
of the head. A sparse scattering of spicules later appeared
laterally on the periphery of the mantle field, and by 6.5
days, spicules formed a complete ring around the circumference
of the mantle field. At 5.5 days,transverse grooves began
to form dorsally, aligned between the bands of large cells
