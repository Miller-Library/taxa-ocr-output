Esteblishment of a Pogitive Rheotezis
The following procedure was used at each of the four tidal
periods, experiment A: 1) A pair of snails taken from the field
and allowed to attach to a glass plate; a current aimed at
their posterior wes then introduced and their behavior recorded
for fifteen to thirty minutes. 2) The linear and angular
movement of the pair was then recorded for fifty minutes while
in a 2 cm glass tube with a water flow of 55 cm/sec. 3) Step
one was then repested.
This was done on 16 specimen for two complete tidal
periods. There were twice as many turns to the left as to the
right in "responce" to the current on the plate. Sixty-four
per cent of 55 trials was as illustrated in diagram I.
This behavior was duplicated by two snails on four trials
mede using a sand substrate of two degrees of coarseness.
The behavior displayed in the flow tube was essentially
uniform. All displayed a positive rheotaxis reguardless of
innitial orientation, except for three: one female went entirely
negative, and two showed no responce. Of the other thirteen,
three showed brief negative responces. A negative geotaxis
occurred durring about 80% of the runs. In dividual rates
were commonly sporatic and varried from O to 15 cm/min.
No correlation between activity and tidal period could be made.
An identicle procedure was begun on L. scutulata. The
four snails tested showed the same positive rheotexis and
negative geotexis. However, seven of the nine turns recorded
on the plate test were to the right.
