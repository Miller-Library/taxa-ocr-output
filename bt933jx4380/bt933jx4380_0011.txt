drew away 30% of the population in 45 minutes and 70% of the
population in 3 hours.
Controls indicated that general illumination seemed to have
no appreciable effedt on the experiment. Although, changes
in intensity such as lights or shadows will evoke a tentacle
withdrawing responce. During one trial of experiment A done
in general illumination, a beast withdrew its tentacles when
the experimentor moved his hand in front of it 40 cm away.
Responces to Simulated Wave Action
Groups of 10 L. planaxis were subjected to .5, 1.0,1.5,

2.5, and 5 minutes of aireated water turbulence and timed
during their retreat from the bottom of a 30 cm tank. These
population rates were then compafred with the rates of
populations subjected todry turbulence and no turbulence.
There seemed to be no significant effect of turbulence
although the dry turbulence populations were more like the
turbulence populations than the control populations
A sex difference of greater female activity which reversed
during the month of May might have been revieled.
During these experiments the snails showed a preference
for the sides not exposed, to illumination although controlson
on general illumination showed no more effect than would be expected
by chance.
