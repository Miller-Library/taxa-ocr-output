activity was appreciably decreased. Linear rates decreased
and angular movement dropped to almost none, except to perform k fad
a negative geotaxis, which occurred only half of the time.
There were , however, no negative rheotactic responces and the
ratio of left to right turns increased to about 3 to 1. This
experimental apparatus was reversed for half of the tests to
act as a control for possible systematic error.
It is possible that there is an innate tendency for counter
clockwise movement in L. planaxis. On several occasions snails,
which were allowed to attach, spontaneously started to turn to
the left. Four snails with tentacles removed, one pair with
right tentacles removed, exhibited the typical responce in
experiment A. A population study was made on 339 large (12-16 mm)
L. plenaxis located on a vertical surface 12 to 22 feet.
Forty-seven per cent were oriented vertically and 44% were
oriented from 5° to 85°, to the left of the vertica.
The asymetricel Littorine shell and its hydrodynamic
properties are of importance in influencing the behavior
of the snails. Two types of experiment were attempted in order
to determinethe physical reaction of the shell alone. In the
first a withdrawn L. planaxis was repeatedly placed in a
current at various angles. The tendency was for the shell
to orient negatively. Directly depending upon the current rate,
an angle of 30° to 75' was formed to the left of the currental
axis. Qualitative estimates of the relative ease this position
was reached from innitial left and right side exposures were also
made (see diagram II). In the second, shells were mounted on
