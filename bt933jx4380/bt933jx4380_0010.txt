small rods, which were attached at various positions in the
would be foot area. If the attechment si anterior, as would be
the case when the foot first portnudes, the shell orients directly
into the current. If the attachment is more posterior the
shell orients to the left exposing its right side (see diegram
III). Thus, it would be easier for a left turn to be made
when either the tail or right side were facing the current
and a right turn when the left side was facing the current.
Perhaps the physical properties of the shell have conditioned
the L. planaxis to counter clockwise movement.
Geotaxis vs Rheotaxis
Overnight tests on 50 snails and one hour tests on 24
snails indicate that a negative geotaxis dominates the
positive rheotaxis in both species. This holds in L. planaxis
for angles of 8°, 10°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and 90° with a current
of 25 cm/sec. The rates of movement suggest that it might be

more difficult to respond to the negative geotaxis when
traveling with the current.
More exceptions were found in the longer esperiments,
especially among L. scutulata, which once responded
positively to a 30' inclination with a positive rheotaxis
in a test made during low low tide.
Phototaxis vs Rheotexis
In controls on experiment A, 20 snails in tubes of still
watter showed a positive phototexis when given a light gredient.
This often, however, tekes several hours to elicit a total
population responce. In one experiment a current of 5 cm/sec
