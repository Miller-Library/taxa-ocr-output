In preliminary investigations, one pair of L. planaxis
showed opposite rheotactic behavior corresponding to the
depth of the passing current. A shallow flow covering the lower
third of the beast elicited a positive taxis, while a flow
covering about two thirds of the beast elicited a negative
taxis. These responces were tested three times in this pair,
although subsequent investigations failed to reproduce these
results.
An hour and a half test on four snails suggested that the
rate of movement might be inversely proportional to current
velocities of 12, 36, and 58 cm/sec. In general whenever the
current became tto great or when fatigue set in, beasts from
both species would withdraw their tentacles. They oriented into
the current unless the innitial force was too great, in which
case a preservation reaction of forming a suction grip with
the foot (Ohsawa ') dominated any rheoztaxis. This is in
agreement with North's observation that L. planaxis were easier
todislodge when posteriorly oriented to the current.
Rheotaxis appears to be a strong responce in both species
of Littorine. In one experiment on four L. planaxis and six
L. scutulata, a representative of each species demonstrated a
strong positive taxis after seven days of a 36 cm/sec current.
Over half, however, either crawled or were washed out of the
apparatus after 48 hours.
In repeating experiment A on the same subjects a month
later, several behavioral tendencies seemed more steriotyped.
Only half the current first used was employed. Even then,
