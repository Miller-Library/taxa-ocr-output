Evaluation
My main criticism of the course, which is minor relative
to its benefits, was the absence of a syllabus. Granted one
of the lessons to learn in life is to take the initiative,
however, I think that it was a relatively expensive lesson.
Had the class definitely known that it was on its own, I think
that we could have organized ourselves for more intercommunica-
tion and consequent benefit
The main fault in my work was that I failed to relate the
potpourrii of experiments soon enough so that one or two
questions could be answered reliably.
