Introduction
The following experiments were carried out at Hopkins
Marine Station during Apri and May, the mating season of
L. planaxis. At the end of May a population survery showed
that L. planaxis were found primarily between :4 and t10.
In one area exposed to the surf, they were found between -1l
and t 21 feet. The L. planaxis used as specimen were taken
from two populations, which were between t3 and + 8 feet.
Most of the L. planaxis at H.M.S. range between 6 and
15 mm in size. The specimen used here were between 9.5 and
13.4 mm. This is a slightly larger collection than thoes in
the intermediate group North ('54) worked with in his maximum
current study. North reports that a current of 230 cm/sec
was sufficient todisloge a majority of the snails studied.
The currents used in these experiments ranged from 5 to 64 cm/sec.
The water temperature varied from 12.6'to 13.2Â° C, which is
slightly over a degree warmer than the range of the morning sea
temperatures for the same period.
Most of the results reported were obtained from single tests
or isolated observations and should only be used as elementary
guides for further work. Particulars of an experiment may
