The limpet Acmaea digitalis Eschscholtz, 1833, is a
common inhabitant of the high intertidal rocky shores of the
North American Pacific coast. Populations of A. digitalis
are not randomly distributed but are often clustered into
groups in limited areas with comparatively few solitary
limpets on the surrounding regions. No specific studies of
clustering behavior have been made on A. digitalis, although
Frank (1966) mentions the occurrence of aggregations in deÂ¬
pressions and other irregularities in the rock. Abe (1932)
studied the behavior of clusters of the limpet Acmaea
dorsuosa Gould in Japan. Abe's study, however, covered a
period of two years and his results showed mainly seasonal
variations.
