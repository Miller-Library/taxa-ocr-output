The present study, conducted at Hopkins Marine Station
on Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was carried out
to provide a better picture of the clustering behavior of
A. digitalis. On April 25, 1966, fourteen clusters were
placed under observation. Eleven of these persisted only
two to three days and only three clusters remained intact
with regard to the area occupied and members present for a
period of a month. This paper documents the activity of the
largest of the three remaining clusters.
For present purposes a cluster is defined as an aggre¬
gation of three or more animals, each within one centimeter
of its nearest neighbor. Animals farther than one centi¬
meter from the closest member of a cluster were not included
in the cluster. The clusters studied were located on the
east face of a large island of granite rock some eighty feet
offshore. Waves broke on the opposite side of the island.
rolled around and surged below the limpets in a narrow
channel, splashing them thoroughly at high water. The par-
ticular cluster studied was located six feet above 0.O water
level. No macroscopic algae were present in the area and the
microscopic algae seemed evenly distributed. The rock sur-
face was fairly smooth with a fold or crack rising up the
center. The upper end of this fold, where the cluster
studied was located, presented a shallow depression on the
