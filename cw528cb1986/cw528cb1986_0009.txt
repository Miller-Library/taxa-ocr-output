Carol S. Millard
(Miyamoto, 1964; Peters, 1964). Whatever the mechanism, it
may be similar to that involved in "homing" in limpets.
During the month that the clusters were observed four of the
animals were seen to return to the same exact location and
orientation at successive low tides for period of two or
three days. They then changed resting spots and repeated
this behavior for several more days. Homing in some A.
digitalis was also noticed by Miller (1966).
SUMMARY
Acmaea digitalis populations often cluster on inter-
tidal rocks at low tide. Clustering occurs in areas which
receive some shade and some protection from direct wave
action. Animals disperse on a rising tide. Reclustering
occurs during tidal ebb while rocks are still wet, and takes
place both day and night.
A cluster varying in size from 22 to 44 individuals
occupied an average of 15 sq. in. (range 8 - 20 sq. in.)
each day over a 32 day period. Daily shifts in cluster
position occurred; total cumulative area occupied was 77 sq.
in.
Only 17 members of the original cluster remained after
32 days while a total of 22 new members entered.
