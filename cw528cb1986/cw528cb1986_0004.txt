The location offered some protection from the prevailing
winds.
To facilitate the plotting of cluster position on the
rock a grid of red dots was painted at 1½ inch intervals on
the rock surface. Within this grid the positions of indi¬
viduals could be designated with good accuracy. The limpets
present on April 25, 1966 were marked with India ink to
distinguish them from each other and from the original
members. The limpets were observed daily at low water for
a week and their positions mapped at each observation.
Thereafter, they were observed at intervals of one to
seven days. Several attempts were made to chart the move¬
ments of the limpets at rising and falling tides. For
these observations pencil notes were made on x-ray film
with the emulsion removed and surface roughened, facili¬
tating writing underwater. The water invariably became so
rough that plotting the movements of the cluster throughout
an entire tidal cycle was impossible.
General observation of the cluster showed that the
limpets move when they are being wetted by the splash of
incoming waves on a rising or falling tide. Within a half
hour after they have first been splashed, the majority of
