the limpets begin to move upward and laterally on the rock.
In this reaction, corroborated by Miller (1966), the lower
limpets begin to move before the higher ones; the low ani¬
mals are more frequently and heavily splashed. Once moye¬
ment has started the animals crawl upwards and laterally for
distances of two to six feet. Thus at high water the cluster
is dispersed. The animals remain more or less active while
the tide is in. As the water level recedes again, they tend
to regroup themselves into a cluster, in approximately the
position occupied by the previous cluster.
The first question posed was: does the cluster occupy
the same amount of space and the same area on the rock
consistently? To answer this question the daily positions
and areas occupied by the cluster at low water were compared
for successive days (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be seen
that the cluster shifted its position from day to day. The
area occupied averaged 15 sq. in. and varied from 8 to 20 sg.
in. The cumulative total area of rock surface occupied by
the cluster during the month of observation was 77 sg. in.
(see Figure 1,u). There was always some overlap between the
positions occupied by the cluster on successive days. This
overlap ranged from 37% to 75% of the total area occupied at
the time of observation (see Table 1). New area, not
