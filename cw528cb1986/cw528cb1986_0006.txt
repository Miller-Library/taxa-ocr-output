previously inhabited during the period of observation, was
added as the cluster changed daily in its shape and location
on the rock.
Another question to be answered concerns cluster member¬
ship (Figures 3 and 4). The membership of the cluster varied
from day to day as animals entered the cluster, remain asso¬
ciated with it for a period, and then either left the area
or remained nearby but not actually in the cluster. Later.
some of these limpets rejoined the cluster. Thus, it could
be observed that the turnover and variation in cluster mem¬
bership was something occurring in a relatively constant
group. Only a few unmarked limpets entered the cluster area
after the first week, during which eleven newcomers joined
the cluster. In the month that followed, fewer than ten un-
marked limpets joined. Two animals were observed to wander
one to four feet from the cluster area. The closer of the
two returned after five days; the other did not return.
Observations of Acmaea digitalis in several different
locations around the Monterey Peninsula indicate that, in
general, clusters are found in more protectéd areas. They
tend to occur in spots which receive more shade than the sur¬
rounding rock face due to a slight depression in the rock
barely noticeable when the full sun is on the whole rock face,
