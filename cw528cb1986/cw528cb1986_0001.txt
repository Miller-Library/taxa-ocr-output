MILLARD, CAROL S. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University, Pacific Grove, Calif., USA.) The clustering
behavior of Acmaea digitalis. The Veliger
Acmaea digitalis popula-
tions often cluster on intertidal rocks at low tide.
Clustering occurs in areas which receive some shade and some
protection from direct wave action. Animals disperse on a
rising tide. Reclustering occurs during tidal ebb while
rocks are still wet, and takes place both day and night. A
cluster varying in size from 22 to 44 individuals occupied an
average of 15 sq. in. (range 8 - 20 sq. in.) each day over a
32 day period. Daily shifts in cluster position occurred;
total cumulative area occupied by the cluster in 32 days
was 77 sq. in. Only 17 members of the original cluster reÂ¬
mained after 32 days, while a total of 22 new members entered.
