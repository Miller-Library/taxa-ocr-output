On the rock island where most of this study was carried out,
between 1:30 and 3:00 P.M. the cluster areas would be out¬
lined by a shade pattern which covered them but left the
rest of the rock in full sunlight. Clustering also tends
to occur on surfaces at right angles to the sea which receive
some surge and splash from waves but do not bear the full
brunt of the breakers. In areas directly exposed to wave
action Acmaea digitalis have not been observed to cluster,
although their populations may be very dense. Here they
remain randomly dispersed, although small, temporary clusters
of three to six animals may aggregate in a crack or depres¬
sion in the rock.
The factors stimulating clustering are not fully
known. Animals cluster when the tide is out and disperse
when the tide is in, at night as well as during the day,
thus light does not seem to be a direct and immediate
causal factor. Tide level and wave action appear to play
an important role. The limpets recluster when they are
still being splashed on an ebbing tide and the area is still
totally wet, as though the frequency of splash and the amount
of water passing over them were being measured. The fact
that the animals recluster when the rock is wet and may do
so at night seems to indicate that clustering is not similar
