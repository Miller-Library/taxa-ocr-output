to the phenomenon of aggregation in sow bugs which keep
moving until they end up in the dampest and shadiest spot
available (Allee 1926) It is also difficult to look at
clustering as a purely random occurrence because it is seen
that limpets return to a fairly stable cluster area.
Some observations made suggest that the height of the
sea at high water and the degree of wave action may influ¬
ence the height on the rocks where clustering occurs,
Toward the end of the month that the cluster shown in Figure
1 was observed, the weather grew progressively more stormy,
and wave action increased. During this period the cluster
rose in its position on the rock (Fig. 1), gradually occupy¬
ing a higher area. Also, the cluster underwent progressive
fragmentation with time. This behavior recalls the finding
of Abe (1932) that clustering is seasonal, and that the
clusters of A. dorsuosa break up shortly after the winter
storms begin.
The means by which animals are able to find their ways
back to the cluster area are not clear. There is a possibil¬
ity that mucous trails are involved. Another animal which
occurs slightly above A. digitalis in the intertidal region,
Littorina planaxis Philippi, has been proven to follow mucous
trails left on rocks by members of its own or other species
