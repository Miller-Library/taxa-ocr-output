I would especially like to thank Dr. Donald P. Abbott of
Hopkins Marine Station for his assistance and guidance during
this study. I also wish to thank Galen Hilgard and Raymond
Markel who helped me obtain equipment, and Tudy Balesteri for
keeping an eye on me when field work was necessary at high
tide and access to my offshore rock was difficult. My sin¬
cere appreciation goes to Susan E. Fitzpatrick for the let¬
tering on the text figures. This work was made possible by
Grant GY 806 from the Undergraduate Research Participation
Program of the National Science Foundation.
