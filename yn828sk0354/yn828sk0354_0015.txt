Table 1. Approximate stages of N. incessa development
observed at time-course experiment time points. Embryos
incubated at 15c.
Table 2. Comparison of Kn and Vmay
values for amino
acid transport in three different marine invertebrates.
Particular amino acids used to determine each of these sets of
values may not have been the same.
Figure 1. Leakage of labeled-leucine from pulsed embryos
into surrounding filtered seawater. Embryos pulsed in the
presence of 2 X 10
M emetine (protein synthesis inhibitor)
did not show increased leakage over control.
Figure 2. Concentration of leucine and methionine in
developing N. incessa embryos reaches several hundred times
ambient concentration.
Ambient leucine concentration = 1x 10Â°M
3 M.
Ambient methionine concentration = 7x 10
Figure 3. Leucine uptake rate by N. incessa embryos
increases dramatically post-fertilization. Ambient leucine
concentration = 1x 10
M.
Figure 4. Methionine uptake rate by N. incessa embryos
increases dramatically post-fertilization. Ambient methionine
concentration = 7x 10
Figure 5. Approximately 703 of leucine transported into
developing N. incessa embryos is incorporated into protein.
Figure 6. Approximately 153 of methionine transported into
developing N. incessa embryos is incorporated into protein.
Figure 7. Developing N.incessa embryos deplete a closed
environment of available amino acids by as much as 503,
significantly lowering ambient concentrations and,
consequently, altering uptake rates. Initial ambient
concentrations:
leucine = 1x 10
methionine - 7x 10
Values calculated from embryo uptake rates -- measurements were
NOT taken for amino acid content of seawater.
Figure 8. Autoradiograph of SDS Gels.
Upper gel contains successive time points of developing embryos
(1,3,6,12,18,24,36,48 hours post-fertilization).
Lower gel contains successive time points of unfertilized eggs
(0,1,3,6,12 hours old).
Samples in both gels for time point 1 hour post-fertilization
were incorrectly processed. Time points 0,1,3 hours actually
probably represent 4 hours post-fertilization.
