methionine (stock specific activity of 1361 Ci/mmol, undiluted)
were added simultaneously to 4 ml of a 1000 embryo/ml
suspension to final concentrations of 1.0 x 10"°M for leucine
and 7.0 x 10"2 M for methionine. The embryos were kept in
suspension with gentle bubbling. At the end of the incubation
period, embryos were washed three times with cold FSW to
remove unassimilated labeled amino acid. Two ml of cold 102
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with 1 mg/ml cold carrier leucine
was then added to the embryo pellet. Following extraction at
4C for 1 hour, the embryos were sedimented and 500 ul of
supernatant was added to 5 ml of Ecolume scintillation fluid
for determination of free amino acid content. The remainder of
the TCA supernatant was aspirated and the embryo pellet was
then washed three times with 2 ml cold TCA. The pellet was
dissolved in 2 ml 0.5 M-NaoH with 58 Triton X to obtain the
TCA-insoluble fraction (protein). 500 ul of this solution was
added to 5 ml of Ecolume scintillation fluid to assay for
incorporation of the labeled amino acid into protein.
Radioactivity measurements were made in a Beckman LS-1300
scintillation counter. Counting efficiencies were corrected
for differing quenches by the two solvents, TCA and NaoH/Triton
using external standards. The efficiencies observed were in
the range of 15-208 for 3H and 508 for 328.
SDS GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND AUTORADIOGRAPHY
Samples were prepared by adding 100 ul of 2X SDS buffer
(200 mg sucrose, 40 mg sodium lauryl sulfate, and 40 ul beta¬
mercaptoethanol in 2 ml distilled water) to a pellet of 3000
