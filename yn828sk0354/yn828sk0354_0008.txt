accumulated in the embryo. To test this, 6-hour embryos were
incubated in 1 x 10-6 M leucine with or without 2x 10"9
emetine HCl, a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 15 minutes at
150. After rapid washing to remove the remaining labeled amino
acid, the embryos were left in fresh FSW at 150 for varying
periods of time during which they could leak out accumulated
amino acid, if they do indeed leak.
The leakage of up to 308 of the transported leucine after
10 minutes in FSW as implied by Figure 5 indicates that leakage
from the embryo is substantial. The downward trend of Figure
5, however, is inconsistent and most likely due to experimental
error. As the rate of leakage, if it occurred, would depend
upon the concentration gradient, one would expect that if the
internal concentration of free amino acid were increased, the
leakage rate would show a corresponding increase. The presence
of a protein synthesis inhibitor would prevent amino acids from
incorporating into proteins, forcing them to remain in solution
and thereby increasing their internal concentration relative to
the control. The addition of emetine, a potent protein
synthesis inhibitor (843 inhibition observed), during the
pulse, however, failed to elicit increased leakage rates,
implying that leakage is not occurring to a significant extent
and that the transport system does not have to overcome rapid
diffusion of amino acids to the environment.
Km AND Vmax
Values for K and Vpay of transport were obtained for
leucine uptake only. Table 2 shows how the values obtained for
