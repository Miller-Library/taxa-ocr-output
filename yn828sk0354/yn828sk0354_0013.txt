SUMMARY
N. incessa embryos concentrated leucine and methionine in
15 minutes to levels as great as 200 and 400 times,
respectively, over ambient concentrations. This concentrating
ability did not become activated until 3 hours post-
fertilization. The apparent concentrating ability of
unfertilized eggs, albeit 4 times lower than maximal fertilized
rates, suggests that the transport system is present in the
unfertilized egg, simply awaiting activation upon
fertilization. Leucine appears to be channeled primarily into
protein while methionine seems to remain largely
unincorporated. The lower level of methionine incorporation
may be due to its infrequent occurrence in common proteins, its
cleavage from proteins with the leader peptide, or its
metabolism in other biosynthetic pathways.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to acknowledge the help and guidance of
Professor David Epel, Dr. Robert Swezey, and Denis Larochelle,
without which this project would have been impossible.
