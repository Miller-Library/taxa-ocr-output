ABSTRACT
Marine invertebrate embryos can concentrate amino acids
from dilute solution against gradients as steep as 10Â°. I
report here that Notoacmea incessa embryos can concentrate
leucine and methionine 200 and 400 times, respectively, over
ambient levels after 15 minutes incubation. Transport
increased at 3 hours post-fertilization with maximal rates for
the first 36 hours of development occurring by 12-18 hours
post-fertilization. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis of leucine
of 4.9 X 10-14
uptake revealed a Km of 1.262 uM and a Vmay
moles/embryo/15 minutes. This Ky value is comparable to that
observed for other marine invertebrate embryos, but the Vmay
value is 10-100 times lower. Approximately 703 of the leucine
transported by the embryo was incorporated into protein, as
compared to 153 for methionine. Several possible explanations
for the different rates of incorporation are presented.
