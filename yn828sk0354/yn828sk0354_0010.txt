DISCUSSION
Embryos of N. incessa were pulsed with labeled leucine and
methionine and rates of uptake were observed to change during
the course of the first 36 hours of development. Over a 15
minute pulse, the embryos maximally concentrated leucine to 200
times over ambient and methionine to 400 times over ambient.
Leucine also showed considerable incorporation into protein,
while much of the methionine remained free.
The apparent ability of unfertilized eggs to concentrate
amino acids 50 to 100 times over ambient (Figures 1,2,3)
suggests that unfertilized eggs possess the same transport
system as fertilized eggs, but which is not activated to the
same extent. This proposition that increased transport of
amino acids results from the activation of a pre-existing
system rather than the de novo synthesis of one post-
fertilization is demonstrated much more directly by Epel (Epel,
1972), where activation of transport is shown to remain
unaffected by fertilization in the presence of protein
synthesis inhibitors.
Leucine and methionine transport is significantly
activated by 3 hours post-fertilization. Uptake rates increase
steadily through 12-18 hours, but level-off soon afterwards.
The leveling-off of uptake rates after 12 to 18 hours may
indicate that maximal transport has been achieved by that time,
but it is also possible that this is simply a consequence of
the depletion of the available amino acid pool to levels
sufficiently low to affect uptake rates adversely (Figure 4).
Adding amino acid in non-limiting amounts would resolve this
