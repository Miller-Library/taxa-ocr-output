ambiguity.
The close agreement of the K value for N. incessa with
those for S. purpuratus and C. gigas suggests that a similar
type of membrane transporter molecule is involved, although the
particular amino acids used to determine the values were not
same in all three cases. The lower value of Vpay observed for
N. incessa as compared to S. purpuratus (Table 2), however,
may be due either to a lower density of transporters in the N.
incessa membrane or a smaller surface area available for
transport. Although the surface area of the N. incessa egg
(diameter 140 um), assuming a smooth sphere, is nearly 3.5
times larger than that of the S. purpuratus egg (diameter 75
um), microvilli as observed by Epel (Epel, 1977) on the surface
of the S. purpuratus egg could conceivably provide the smaller
egg with a greater surface area. As to the reason why N.
incessa might have either a lower density or a lesser surface
area for transport, perhaps N. incessa embryos do not need to
transport amino acids as vigorously as S. purpuratus or C.
gigas, since they must only survive for 4 days before they
begin feeding, wheras S. purpuratus and C. gigas must last for
over 30 days (Strathmann, 1987). Further studies are necessary
to confirm the Vmax
value observed for N. incessa and to
determine the nature of its deviance from other values, if any.
Berg has noted that exogenous valine is incorporated into
protein preferentially over endogenous stores (Berg, 1970).
While incorporation of endogenous leucine was not considered
here, the tendency of leucine transported from the environment
