MATERIALS AND METHODS
HANDLING OF GAMETES
Notoacmea incessa, commonly found grazing on the brown
algae Egregia menziesii, were collected from the intertidal in
the general vicinity of the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California. Immediately following collection, the
limpets were placed in filtered seawater, originally at 150,
but allowed to come to room temperature over several hours to
induce spawning.
Eggs were fertilized in filtered seawater with penicillin
and streptomycin (each at 150 mg/1, hereafter referred to as
FSW+) by addition of dilute sperm. Approximately 1 hour after
fertilization, excess sperm was removed by washing the eggs
three times. Washing involved sedimentation of the embryos by
hand centrifugation, aspiration of the supernatant, and
resuspension in fresh FSW+.
Embryo concentrations were adjusted to 500/ml (0.053 y/v)
or 1000/ml (0.18 v/v). Direct embryo counts were performed on
multiple 50 ul aliquots from homogenous suspensions. Embryo
volume was calculated from measurements of egg diameter using a
stage micrometer and light microscope.
The developing embryos were incubated at 500/ml FSW+ at
150 in a beaker with stirring. FSW- was changed at 12 hour
intervals to maintain water quality.
MEASUREMENT OF AMINO ACID TRANSPORT
Embryos were pulsed with radioactive-labeled amino acid
for 15 minutes at 150. "H-leucine (stock specific activity of
52 Ci/mmol, diluted with cold leucine to 5.2 Ci/mmol) and 328-
