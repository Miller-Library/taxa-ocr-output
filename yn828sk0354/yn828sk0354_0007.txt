UPTAKE RATES
Figures 1 and 2 describe uptake of leucine and methionine
by N. incessa embryos from the environment during the first 36
hours of development. Transport occurs at a low level in the
unfertilized egg and declines as the egg deteriorates.
Fertilized eggs show increased transport activity beginning at
3 hours post-fertilization, continuing to increase for the next
9-15 hours to a level 4 times the unfertilized rates.
Transport rates then remained constant through the termination
of the experiment at 36 hours post-fertilization. The
approximate stages of development at each time point are given
in Table 1. Figure 3 shows that embryos concentrated leucine as
high as 200 times over ambient and methionine as high as 400
times over ambient during the 15 minute pulse. Figure 4 shows
the depletion of the available amino acid pool from the
environment as calculated from the moles of amino acid taken up
by the embryos. This depletion of the available pool may have
been large enough to alter significantly the ambient
concentrations of the amino acids, perhaps thereby affecting
uptake rates.
LEAKAGE OF AMINO ACIDS FROM EMBRYO
Although there was an apparent uptake of labeled amino
acid, it is possible that uptake involved both transport into
the embryo and diffusion out of the embryo down the steep
concentration gradient. If this were the case, then the
washing procedure with FSW- to remove the remaining labeled
amino acid would also wash out much of the amino acid which had
