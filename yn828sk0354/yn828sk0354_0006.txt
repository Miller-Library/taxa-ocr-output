embryos which had been pulsed for 145 minutes with 7 x 10"2 M
998-methionine. The samples were boiled for 10 minutes to
neutralize endogenous protease activity, sonicated with a cell
disrupter to homogenize the mixture, and frozen for storage.
The samples (15 ul) were run on a 108 SDS gel for 2 hours at a
constant current of 25 mA and allowed to expose X-ray film for
24 hours to produce the autoradiograph.
