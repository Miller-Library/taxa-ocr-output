INTRODUCTION
From the moment of fertilization until an organism has
developed a functional digestive system, one might assume that
the events of development must be fueled by the embryo's
endogenous reserves stored in the yolk of the egg. Manahan,
however, has reported that only 133 of a developing marine
invertebrate embryo's metabolic demands can be met by these
endogenous reserves (Manahan, 1988). Many studies (reviewed in
Stephens, 1988) have suggested that the developing embryo
supplies the remainder of its metabolic demand by concentrating
dissolved organic matter from the surrounding seawater. In
fact, marine invertebrate embryos can concentrate free amino
acids from seawater against gradients as steep as 10Â° to 10'.
As thermodynamically unfavorable as this would seem, Manahan
has calculated that the cost of transporting a mole of glycine
against such a concentration gradient would be less than 43 of
the potential benefit an organism could derive by the oxidation
of that same mole of glycine (Manahan, 1983).
Most of the present work, however, has concentrated on the
mechanics of the transport system itself and few have focused
attention on the changes which this system may undergo as an
organism passes through the early stages of development. This
study describes the pattern of amino acid transport during the
first 36 hours of development of the marine invertebrate
gastropod, Notoacmea incessa.
Uptake of leucine and methionine rapidly increased at 3
hours post-fertilization, reaching maximum concentrations of
200 and 400 times, respectively, over ambient. The Ky value of
