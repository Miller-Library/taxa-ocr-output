INTRODUCTION
There has been very little immunological work done on
invertebrates relative to the large amount done on vertebrates.
and especially on mammals. The discovery by Cantacuz√©ne (1912.
1925, 1934) that the European hermit crab, Eupagurus prideauxii,
apparently develops immunity to the toxin of the sea anemone,
Adamsia palliata, through close biological association with it
suggests that the phenomenon of immunity might account for the
ability of the local hermit crab, Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson,
1859), to walk unharmed over large beds of anemones. To ascer-
tain if immunity was actually protecting them, an attempt was
made to immunize P. granosimanus to the toxic effects of an
homogenate of the sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima.
The manner of assay for immunity involved the determination
of the median lethal dose (LD50) of a standard homogenate for a
sample of the P. granosimanus population by the method of Finney
(1962). This LDgo was then compared to the LDgo of the same
homogenate determined for two groups of P. granosimanus previously
injected with different sublethal doses of the homogenate. In
the two latter cases median lethal doses significantly larger
than that for the normal sample would be considered evidence for
the development of immunity to the toxic effect of the homogenate,
Complementary to the above experiment an attempt was made to
increase resistance of P. granosimanus to anemone toxin by placing
them for a period of time in an aquarium containing a high
concentration of anemones. Again the median lethal dose was
