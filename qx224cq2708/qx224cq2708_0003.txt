computed and used as an indication of the tolerance of the group.
MATERIALS & METHODS
All the P. granosimanus used were collected at one time at
Stillwater Cove, just north of Carmel beach, Carmel, California.
The specific area of the cove in which the animals were collected
had a low concentration of anemones of all kinds relative to
other areas of the coast.
About twenty-five small Anthopleura elegantissima were mas-
cerated in 150 ml. of Ringer's solution and then homogenized.
This standard homogenate was frozen for later use in separate
bottles.
A. The LDgo for normal crabs was determined as follows:
seventy P. granosimanus were cracked out of the shells they were
inhabiting and were divided into seven groups of ten individuals
each irrespective of size. Each group was injected with a dif-
ferent dilution of the standard homogenate, one group serving as
a control. The control group was injected with only Ringer's
solution which was used as the vector for the homogenate. The
injections were made into the right side of the abdomen through
a portion of the columellar muscle with a Yale one quarter ml.
syringe with needle size +26. Each individual was weighed and a
dose proportional to weight was given, namely, .Ol ml. of homogenate
at the appropriate dilution per .2 grams body weight. Broken but
usable shells were returned to the hermit crabs and the number dead
in each group was recorded between twelve and twenty-four hours
