later. An individual which was moribund but moving either its
first or second antennae was classified as alive; if no movement
of antennae was observable the individual was recorded as dead.
B. Two other groups of P. granosimanus were injected with
sublethal doses of the standard homogenate which was diluted to
1:160 and 1:320 with Ringer's solution, i.e. they contained 144
Ag N/.200 ml and 72 Ag N/200 ml, respectively. After an incubation
period of six days each group was challenged in the manner des-
cribed above and the median lethal doses were computed.
C. Seventy P. granosimanus were placed in an aquarium with
approximately forty-five small Anthopleura elegantissima for
seven days. At the end of this time they were challenged as
previously described and the LD50 computed.
RESULTS
The doses, numbers of animals used, and number killed are
presented in Tables 1 - 4.
The values of the median lethal doses and their approximate
95% confidence intervals for the various groups are presented in
Table 5. The values are expressed in micrograms of nitrogen per
200 mg. of body weight.
If we regard the values of the median lethal doses as the
mean tolerances, tests of significance can be performed between
the mean of the normal sample and the means of each of the other
samples. In each case the test was performed at as.05 and con-
firmed the obvious fact that there is no apparent difference
