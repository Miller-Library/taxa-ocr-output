between the means, i.e., the null hypothesis was accepted each

strated.
DISCUSSION
Using the method described there is no evidence for an in¬
crease in the mean tolerance of P. granosimanus to the toxic
effects of sea anemone homogenate after exposure to these animals
or their extracts.
Since the null hypothesis has been rejected the power of
the tests becomes important. The power was approximately computed
for the test between the mean of the normal sample and the sample
immunized at 114 g N2/.2 grams body weight. If it is assumed.
for instance, that the actual difference between the means was 145
gN the power is about .18. The cause of this relatively low
power for the relatively large sample size lies in the fact that
a natural population heterogeneous for size, age, and physiological
condition was sampled. While an attempt was made to use animals
having a minimal exposure in the past, the actual history of these
animals was not known and one can assume that this accounts for
some of the variability of natural resistance.
It seems most probablg that P. granosimanus is protected from
anemone nematocysts in natural circumstances by the chitinous
exoskeleton which covers the exposed portions of its body.
Results which suggested that P. samuelis does not produce
active immunity to anemone homogenate were obtained but they lacked
