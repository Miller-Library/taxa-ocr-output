vasculature of the two colonies can fuse and a chimeric colony is formed, or a rejection
reaction occurs, causing the two adjacent colonies to retreat and grow in opposite
directions. Finally, as a member of the group that is the closest living invertebrate relative
to the vertebrate lineage, B. schlosseri is phylogenetically poised to address questions
regarding the origins of complex innate and adaptive immunity.
The outcome between two interacting colonies is a form of allorecognition. This
outcome is controlled by a single, highly polymorphic, co-dominantly expressed fusionÂ¬
histocompatibility locus (FuHC) (Fig. 1). A specific gene within this locus, fuhc, was
found to encode the self-ligand that is recognized by the interacting colonies. This gene is
highly polymorphic, and the polymorphisms correlate absolutely with fusibility (De
Tomaso et al., 2005). In order to fuse, two colonies must share at least one of the fuhc
alleles. Another allorecognition gene, fester, has been identified in the FuHC locus
(Nyholm et al., 2006) and encodes a putative receptor for the fuhc ligand. Currently, the
function of another gene, uncle fester, which is also found in the FuHC locus, is being
studied in the allorecognition process (Mckitrick and De Tomaso, in prep). The FuHC
locus also contains a highly polymorphic Dnal-like gene. The function of this gene
(which I will refer to as DnaJ for simplification) is unknown, but the polymorphism
found in this gene in preliminary studies is unexpectedly high, making it a gene of
particular interest. Furthermore, its location in the FuHC locus makes it a candidate
allorecognition gene. This clustering of genes may be similar to the type of clustering
found in the MHC genes. The MHC region in vertebrates is a genomic region that
contains genes involved in immunity and allorecognition (Kindt et al., 2007).
