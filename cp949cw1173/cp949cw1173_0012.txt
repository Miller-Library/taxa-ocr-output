ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor Anthony De Tomaso for his guidance and
support as well as Tanya McKitrick who has been particularly instrumental in the
realization of this project. I would also like to thank the other members of the De Tomaso
lab for their help and advice, specifically Snjezana Rendulic for teaching me lab
techniques and Kathi Ishizuka for sharing her dissection skills. Finally, I would like to
thank George Somero for teaching Bio175H and providing me with the opportunity to get
involved in research.
