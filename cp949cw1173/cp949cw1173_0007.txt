Northern California, Santa Barbara, Eel Pond and Sandwich Bay were 42.0-19.6,
32.6+16.3, 44.0-24.4, 17.2-8.9 and 31.0+15.8 (Fig.2A). The total numbers of
polymorphic sites for the same populations were 127, 73, 81, 51 and 81, respectively
(Fig. 2B). Polymorphic sites were found across the whole gene, but concentrated at the
3'end.
Genetic population structure and phylogenetic analysis. To determine the level
of genetic differentiation at DnaJ, a molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA) was
performed on populations structured into California and Massachusetts groups. The
AMOVA indicated no significant differentiation among populations (FST-O.O, p-0.0),
and 100% of the variation was attributable to within population variation (Table 2). The
locus by locus AMOVA did show significant differentiation among populations averaged
over all loci (Fsr=O.19286, p-0.0). The majority of the variation at each nucleotide was
attributable to within population variation and least attributable to among group variation
(Table 3). The loci with significant Fsr's were concentrated at the 3' end of the gene (Fig.
3). Tajima’s D was insignificant for all populations except for Eel Pond (Tajima’s D =-
1.4737, p=0.0264) (Table 1).
The nucleotide and protein trees show clades that are specific to California and
Massachusetts populations (Fig 4A,B), but the two groups of populations do not
segregate completely into separate clades. Each tree also shows a mixed California and
Massachusetts clade, and shared haplotypes between California and Massachusetts
populations.
Amino acid diversity. The nucleotide sequences were translated into their
amino acid sequence in MacClade and aligned to look for amino acid variation. A
