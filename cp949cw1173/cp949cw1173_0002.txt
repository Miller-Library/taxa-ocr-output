INTRODUCTION
Allorecognition is the ability to recognize self from non-self and has been found
in nearly all metazoans (Medawar, 1957; Burnet, 1971; Buss, 1987). This system of
recognition controls different biological functions, such as the immunological response
against pathogens, the prevention of inbreeding in angiosperms (Nasrallah, 2002), and the
ability to differentiate between closely and distantly related individuals (Maynard-Smith
and Szathmary, 1995). Allorecognition must depend on the presence of a highly
polymorphic gene which is required for the specificity of this process. In vertebrates, it is
controlled by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), while in angiosperms, it is
controlled by the self-incompatibility locus (SI). While allorecognition is pervasive
amongst the animal kingdom, the molecular basis underlying this specificity for most
taxa remains unknown.
The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is an excellent model organism for the
study of allorecognition for several reasons. First, B. schlosseri is an experimentally
accessible and genetically tractable organism. It is born as a tadpole larva with chordate
characteristics that settles within 24 hours and metamorphoses into a sessile invertebrate.
As an adult, it buds asexually to form zooids, genetically identical individuals that are
united by a common vasculature and embedded in a gelatinous tunic. Each zooid can
reproduce sexually and asexually. Thus, multiple experiments can be completed
simultaneously on genetically identical individuals. Second, B. schlosseri possesses a
naturally occurring blood-based transplantation reaction that is controlled by a single
genetic locus. As a colony grows asexually, it often comes into contact with another
colony of the same species. This can result in one of two possible outcomes: the
