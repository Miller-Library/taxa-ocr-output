embryos and tadpoles were removed. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C. RNA was extracted from each Monterey sample using a NucleoSpinû RNA
Extract II kit. CDNA was synthesized from the RNA using a reaction mixture of 1 uL of
Invitrogen Superscript III, 1 uL of oligo dTTis and 0.4 uL 25mM dNTP. The reaction
mixture was heated to 70°C for five min, put on ice for two min and heated to 50°C for
90 min. Pooled CDNA from individuals from Northern California (Half Moon Bay, Santa
Cruz, Moss Landing), Santa Barbara, CA, Eel Pond, MA and Sandwich Bay, MA, were
prepared previously.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed on 1488 bp of the
DnaJ using 0.6 uL DMSO, 4 uL 5X Phusion buffer, 0.15 uL Hot-start Phusion Taq, 0.4
uL of custom-made primers 5'Dnal (S’-GTATTAAGGTCATTTCTTAAACCC-3’) and
DnaJWR (S’-AACACTTGATTACATTTACCGCAAC-3’), 12.29 uL H20 and 2 uL of
CDNA. The cycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 98°C for 3 min, 40
cycles of 98°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 45 sec, and a final extension step of
72°C for 3 min. PCR product was visualized on 1% agarose gels with 0.4 ug/mL of
ethidium bromide. PCR product was cleaned using SpinPrepTM PCR Clean-Up Kit
(Novagen). The cleaned product was A-tailed using 1 uL 1OX NEB Standard buffer, 0.08
uL 25 mM dNTP, 0.08 uL NEB Taq and 9.0 uL template. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 72°C for 20 min. This product was ligated into pGEM T vectors (Promega)
using 1.0 uL 10X ligase buffer, 1.0 uL T4 ligase, 0.5 uL pGEM vector and 7.5 uL of
template. The ligation reaction was carried out at room temperature overnight. The
ligated product was cleaned by N-butanol precipitation. One microliter of cleaned
plasmid was electroporated into 20 uL of Top10 electrocompetent E. coli cells at 1.56
