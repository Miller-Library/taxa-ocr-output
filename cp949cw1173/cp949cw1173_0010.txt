This study has genetically characterized DnaJ. It has shown an unprecedented
amount of polymorphism particularly in the 3' end and amino acid variability at the CÂ¬
terminus. Comprehension of the genetics of DnaJ will help us better understand how the
protein functions. Future studies of DnaJ will examine where the gene is expressed and
its functional role. Gene expression can be determined using in-situ hybridizations.
Because of its location in the fuhc locus, it can be hypothesized that DnaJ is involved in
the allorecognition process. It could possibly be involved in signaling as other Dnal
proteins have been found to be functional in androgen and estrogen signaling (Qiu et al.,
2006). Its function in allorecognition can be determined using siRNA knockouts on the
gene and observing its effect on allorecognition. Since Dnal proteins are also known to
be co-chaperones to Hsp70 proteins (Qiu et al., 2006), it should also be determined
whether our Dnal protein is associated with an Hsp70.
The results of this study also raise a question that is fundamental to evolutionary
biology. How is this high level of genetic variation created? Furthermore, how has this
level of genetic variation been maintained throughout evolutionary time? This question
can also be asked for fuhc and fester. The ascidian does not have any somatic
diversification mechanisms, such as recombination or somatic hypermutation. It has been
estimated that nearly 250 MHC alleles exist within the extant human population.
However, nearly 100 fuhc alleles have been found within Monterey Bay alone, and it has
been estimated that nearly 1000 alleles exist worldwide. Herein, we are reporting the
existence of another highly polymorphic gene, DnaJ, which is found within this locus.
