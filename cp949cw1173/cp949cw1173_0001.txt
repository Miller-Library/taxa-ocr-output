ABSTRACT
When two colonies of the tunicate Botryllus schlosseri encounter one another,
they can either undergo vascular fusion or trigger a rejection reaction that blocks fusion.
This interaction is a form of allorecognition, defined as the ability to recognize self from
non-self, and in B. schlosseri, the outcome of the allorecognition process is determined
by a single, highly-polymorphic fusion-histocompatibility (FuHC) locus. Another highly
polymorphic gene that encodes a Dnal-related protein was found recently in the FuHC
locus. The function of this gene is unknown, but the gene is of particular interest because
it shows a high level of polymorphism, which may indicate a function in allorecognition.
In this study, Dnal was characterized genetically in order to look for patterns of
polymorphism and population structure. The Dnal gene was sequenced from three
California populations and two Woods Hole populations. The sequences showed a high
level of polymorphism, with an average of 82.6 polymorphic sites and 33.35 pairwise
differences within populations. However, the gene showed no population structure
(FsT=O) and 100% of the variation was attributable to within population variation. A
locus by locus AMOVA showed divergence particularly at nucleotides at the 5' end of
the gene and that most of the variation was attributable to within population variation.
Amino acid variability was concentrated at the C-terminal end of DnaJ. These results
suggest either incomplete lineage sorting, linkage disequilibrium and gene hitchhiking or
balancing selection for genetic diversity. The high amount of variation in this gene is
unprecedented and may indicate a particular role in its function.
