p-0.0; FsT=0.92212, p-0.0), whereas fester does not show any structure (Fs-=-0.01506,
p-0.48680) (McKitrick & De Tomaso, unpublished). Balancing selection may also be
generating this genetic diversity. Although the Tajima's D for four of the populations
suggests gene neutrality, there may be selection occurring at portions of the gene. The
average Fsr over all loci indicates that there are divergent loci, particularly at the 3' end.
This pattern of divergent loci is similar to the pattern of amino acid variability, which is
concentrated at the C-terminus. This observation may suggest selection occurring at the
3â€™ end. Further analysis would be needed to determine whether selection is generating
this diversity. The unexpectedly high amount of variation and the possibility of selection
in this region of the protein may suggest that this region plays a crucial role in the
function of the protein. Investigation into whether the C-terminal ends of other Dnal
genes are similarly variable may provide clues as to what is occurring in this region.
Although a high degree of genetic diversity was found, the amount of
polymorphism for DnaJ may be underestimated in this study. Because only several
clones were sequenced for each Monterey individual, the number of heterozygotes and
alleles may have been underestimated. Picking more clones may reveal more alleles.
However, it is also possible that more than two alleles may be present in one individual.
This could be due to multiple gene copies of DnaJ or a phenomenon known as
chimerism, which results from stem cell parasitism in B. schlosseri (De Tomaso, 2006).
In addition, picking more clones from the other populations may also reveal more alleles
as the samples are pooled from many individuals. This would not only reveal more
alleles, but also more polymorphism at the nucleotide level.
