FIGURE LEGEND
Fig. 1. FuHC locus in Botryllus schlosseri. Identified allorecognition proteins include
fuhc and fester. Uncle fester and DnaJ are currently being characterized.
Fig. 2. Nucleotide diversity in DnaJ. Mean number of pairwise differences (A) and total
number of polymorphic sites (B) in DnaJ (1356 bp) for each B. schlosseri population.
Errors are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 3. Nucleotide divergence in DnaJ. Significant Fsr's (pS0.05) from the locus by locus
AMOVA were plotted across the length of the DnaJ sequence.
Fig. 4. Phylogenetic relationships between California and Massachusetts individuals.
Nucleotide (A) and protein (B) trees show California (Red) and Massachusetts (Blue)
clades as well as mixed population clades (Arrows).
Fig. 5. Amino variability of DnaJ. Variability is measured using the Wu-Kabat
coefficient of variability.
