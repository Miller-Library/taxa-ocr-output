KV, 2.5 KV resistance and 186 resistance timing. One milliliter of SOC was added to the
electroporated cells, and the cells were shaken at 225 rpm for one h at 37°C. Twenty
microliters of the cells were plated onto agar plates containing ampicillin, X-gal and
IPTG. Cells were grown overnight at 37°C. White colonies were selected, and the gene
was amplified using T7 and SP6 primers (34 cycles, 53°C annealing). The PCR product
was purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB) and cycle sequenced in four directions and
primers T7 and SP6, or 5'Dnal and WR, and Dnal F3 (5'-
GGAATTAGAGAGAATCGCAACCGAAC-3’) and F14DnaJR (5'¬
ATTGAGAAACTCTTTCGTTGCAAC-3’). The product was cleaned using a 75%
isopropanol precipitation and sequenced using a Prism 3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied
Biosystems).
Sequence analysis
These were aligned, edited and trimmed to 1356 bp in Sequencher and analyzed
in the software ARLEQUIN 2.0. Standard measures of molecular diversity were
calculated, and sequences were analyzed for population structure. Nucleotide and protein
parsimony trees were generated in PAUP 4.0 using a heuristic search. Amino acid
sequences were obtained in MacClade.
RESULTS
Genetic diversity. From the seven Monterey individuals, five were
heterozygous, and eight haplotypes were sequenced. Six haplotypes were obtained from
Northern California, four from Santa Barbara, three from Eel Pond and six from
Sandwich Bay (Table 1). The mean number of pairwise differences for Monterey,
