This DnaJ gene encodes a protein that belongs to the DnaJHsp40 superfamily as
it contains a J-domain at its N-terminus. This J-domain is a 70 amino acid sequence that
is characteristic of all Dnal proteins (Walsh et al., 2004). DnaJ proteins are known to act
as co-chaperones to Hsp70 by binding to Hsp70s through their J domains and stimulating
ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70. Because they regulate Hsp70 function, they play an important
role in protein translation, folding, unfolding, translocation and degradation (Qiu et al.,
2006). Dnal proteins can also be molecular chaperones by themselves or regulate other
chaperones, such as Hsp90. Some DnaJ proteins may have acquired a J-domain in order
to recruit Hsp70 to their substrate, which may require this chaperone to carry out its
function. Proteins containing J domains are highly conserved across evolution and can be
found in bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and one class of DNA viruses (Kelley, 1998).
Therefore, understanding the function of DnaJ may contribute to understanding why J
domains are being used in so many proteins and if there are fundamental mechanisms that
underlie J-domain function.
This study will begin to determine the functionality of DnaJ by characterizing it
genetically. I will look at the patterns of polymorphism and amino acid variability, test
for population structure and determine the phylogeny of DnaJ. This will be achieved by
analyzing sequences of DnaJ from different B. schlosseri populations.

Collection, amplification and sequencing of DNA
B. schlosseri colonies were collected from the side of boat slips at Monterey
Marina, California. One system (7-11 zooids) was dissected out from each colony, and all
