variability plot (Wu and Kabat, 1970) shows that amino acid substitutions are found
across the whole protein, but concentrated at the C-terminus (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
DnaJ is a highly polymorphic gene, at both the nucleotide and amino acid level.
The amount of polymorphism found in DnaJ is similar to the amount of polymorphism
found in the allorecognition genes, fuhc and fester, which have been shown to be highly
polymorphic (De Tomaso et al., 2005; Nyholm et al., 2006). On average, Dna shows a
mean pairwise difference of 33.35 +4.77. For fuhc, the mean pairwise difference was 45
for Woods Hole and 37 for California, and for fester, the mean pairwise difference was
23 for Woods Hole and 34 for California (unpublished data). In contrast, COI, which is
evolving neutrally, has a mean pairwise difference of 1.4 for Woods Hole populations
and 2 for California populations (McKitrick, unpublished). The total number of
polymorphic sites is also unexpectedly high. In Monterey alone, nearly 10% of the locus
is polymorphic, with twelve alleles having 127 polymorphic sites. On average, DnaJ had
82.6 polymorphic sites over all alleles sequenced.
Although this gene has a considerable amount of genetic diversity within
populations, it lacks population structure, as indicated by the AMOVA tests. This lack of
population structure is reflected in the phylogenic protein and nucleotide trees, which
show a mixed California-Woods Hole clade. This observation could be explained by
three processes, either incomplete lineage sorting in which the gene may not be evolving
fast enough to show any differentiation, linkage disequilibrium and genetic hitchhiking to
the fuhc or balancing selection. As a comparison, fuhc (ectodomain) and COl, a neutral
gene, show population structure between California and Woods Hole (Fsr-0.29176,
