conditions related to differential exposure to the water.
The mussels for each area were kept in separate aerated
aquariums and supplied with a continual flow of sea water at
ambient temperature. They were allowed several days to adjust
to the new situation and to begin normal feeding activity
(Macginitie 1941).
The organisms used in the experiments were divided into
three size groups. Size I organisms were 0.8-1.2 cm. in length,
size II organisms 2.8-3.2 cm., and size III organisms 4.8-5.2
cm. Measurement was made at the widest point of the shell
parallel to the ventral edge. These young organisms were chosen
for the experiments to decrease the probability of spawning
during the experiment, thereby minimizing the possibility of
a large change in lipid content and possibly also DDT content
during the experiments. Though M. californianus has been observed
to be sexually mature at a length of 25 mm. and an age of
approximately 4 months, it does not appear to spawn until the
age of about 1 year (Coe and Fox 1942) at a length of approxi¬
mately 80 mm. (Fox and Coe 1943). Young animals were also
chosen for the experiments because of their ability to adjust
more quickly to experimental situations (Jørgensen 1960, 1966;
Macginitie 1941; Coe and Fox 1942).
DDE levels in natural populations were measured directly
by gas chromatography. Samples were extracted and prepared for
chromatographic analysis according to the method described by
Stanley and LeFavoure (1965). Analysis of the extracts was
