food passing through the entire digestive system. The varia-
bility of background DDT levels occurring in natural populations
from different areas, especially in respect to size, was also
considered important because these levels could affect further
DDT uptake. Furthermore, because of the local variation in
pesticide levels, it would be interesting to know to what
extent the immediate environment of the animal might affect
its concentration of DDT.
The aim of this research was to determine background levels
of DDT and its residues in natural populations of Mytilus
californianus and to compare the uptake of C-labeled DDT by
the mussel through different modes of entrance: directly from
the surrounding sea water, and from phytoplankton, part of its
natural food supply. The results of this study show that DDT
does not only enter the food web via the phytoplankton, but may
also be taken up in substantial quantities by organisms higher
in the food web directly from the surrounding water.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The experimental animals were collected in April and May
of 1969 from four different localities around the Monterey
peninsula. These were Cabgrillo Point, Point Pinos, Point Joe,
and Seal Rock in Monterey County, California. The areas were
chosen to represent populations from typical bay and outer coast
localities. The animals were all collected from approximately
the same tidal level to minimize the difference in growth
