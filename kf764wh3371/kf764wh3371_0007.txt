performed on a Beckman GC-4 equipped with an electron capture
detector. The chromatograms were performed isothermally (20090)
on 3 per cent QF-1 on Chromosorb W, 80-100 mesh treated with
DMCS. The carrier gas was helium.
All of the experiments involving C uptake were run in
a similar manner. Prior to incubation of the mussels, the
shells were scraped free of barnacles, limpets, algae and other
attached organisms. The animals were then placed vertically
on a flat surface on absorbent paper to allow water in the mantle
cavity to drain out. This not only induced the mussels to take
in water soon after placement in the DDT solution (Fox, Sverdrup.
and Cunningham 1937), but it also helped clear any food or
inorganic particles suspended in the mantle cavity water.
All experimental organisms were incubated in closed jars
to minimize the loss of DDT from solution through codistillation
(Acree, Beroza, Bowman 1963). Since previous studies have shown
that Mytilus can filter particles as small as 1 u (JÃ¸rgensen
1960; Jorgensen and Goldberg 1953) and oxyhemoglobin particles
as small as 40-50 A (Fox, Oppenheimer, and Kittredge 1953),
the sea water to be used in the containers was millipore filtered
successively through 8 u, 0.45 u, and 0.22 u pore filters to
insure that no particles greater than 0.22 u remained in solution.
In early experiments one organism was placed in each con-
tainer. Size I organisms were incubated in 60 ml. water in a
half-pint jar, size II organisms in 180 ml. in a one-pint jar,
and size III organisms in 540 ml. in a one-quart jar. In later
