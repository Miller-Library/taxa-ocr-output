experiments three organisms, one of each size class, were placed
in each one-quart jar with 780 ml. filtered sea water.
Animals were incubated in concentrations of 10 p.p.t.,
100 p.p.t., 1.0 p.p.b., and 1.4 p.p.b. C -DDT for 12 hours.
Some of the animals were assayed for uptake immediately at
the end of the 12 hours, while others were kept 23 hours in
normal sea water before being tested to show the level of DDI
retained.
The amount of C14 uptake was determined by dissecting the
animal, taking its wet weight, homogenizing it in 1,4-dioxane,
and counting in the scintillation counter. Size I organisms
were homogenized twice in 14 ml. dioxane, size II organisms
twice in 3 ml. dioxane, and size III organisms twice in 6 ml.
dioxane. The extracts from the two homogenates were combined,
and a 2 ml. aliquot was placed in toluene solution and counted
2 minutes in a Nuclear-Chicago Unilux II scintillation counter.
The primary foods of Mytilus are diatoms, dinoflagellates,
and detritus (Field 1921-1922; Buley 1936; Macginitie 1941;
Coe and Fox 1942). The diatom Nitzschia closterium minutissima
was chosen for the feeding experiments because it was readily
filtered out of suspension and digested by Mytilus (Schultis
1969). C+-DDT uptake from phytoplankton was tested in a similar
manner to earlier uptake experiments. A sample of Nitzschia
consisting of approximately 1.24 x 10 cells was taken from a
pure culture and incubated in 6.6 p.p.b. C-DDT for 64 hours
at room temperature in diffuse light. This concentration of
