The preliminary experiments showed that the size I organisms
(0.8-1.2 cm.) concentrated DDT 20 to 70 times greater than did
the size III organisms (4.8-5.2 cm.). This level did not
significantly decrease 23 hours after termination of the incuÂ¬
bations which suggests retention of virtually all DDT taken up
during the experiment. However, correction of these values
was necessary to account for the small organisms having available
a greater volume of water per unit body weight than the large
ones. The correction factor reduced the relative uptake of
size I organisms to approximately 5 tines the uptake by size
III organisms (Table 3). For further verification of this
prediction, three organisms, one of each size class, were tested
in the same container such that each would initially have available
the same total amount of water. Five replicates of the experi-
ment were made and the initial level of C-DDT in the water
was the same for each container, 1 p.p.b. After incubation for
12 hours, the animals were removed and assayed. The results
are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2. The same trends noted earlier
were found, and the earlier corrected values were found to be
valid, as size I organisms concentrated C+-DDT approximately
5 times more than size III organisms.
This same tendency was again evident in the experiments
with the uptake of C-DDT from Nitzschia (Table 5, Figure 3).
The smaller Mytilus concentrated the DDT 4 to 4 times greater
than did the larger ones. However, note that while the same
trend is apparent, the total uptake was far less than the uptake
