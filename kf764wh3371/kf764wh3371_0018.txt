SUMMARY
1. In natural populations Mytilus californianus of lengths
1, 3, and 5 cm. have been found to have concentrations of DDE
of 120, 96, and 62 p.p.b., respectively, per wet weight of body
tissues.
2. Mussels can take up substantial amounts of DDT directly
from the surrounding sea water.
3. Over a 12 hour period mussels 1 cm. in length take up
5 times as much C+-DDT directly from the water as animals
5 cm. in length.
4. The uptake of C+-DDT from phytoplankton by the smaller
mussels is 4-44 times greater than the uptake by the larger
animals over the same time period.
5. The amount of water filtered by a mussel decreases
with age and may account for the more rapid uptake of DDT by
younger organisms.
6. The ability of younger mussels to adjust to experimental
conditions more readily than older ones may also partially explain
the differential uptake rates.
7. It is suggested that if Mytilus is typical of marine
organisms in its ability to concentrate DDT directly from the
surrounding sea water, then the marine pesticide pollution
problem may be greater than originally thought.
