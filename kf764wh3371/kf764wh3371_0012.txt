The relative level of DDE could be higher in the smaller
organisms if only the larger ones had the capability of metabo-
lizing and excreting the pesticide. However, other studies
have shown no such breakdown occurring in either small or large
M. californianus (Davis and Comrey 1969).
The findings of this study may be related to the fact that
young Mytilus grow, filter, and adjust more rapidly than older
ones when disturbed (Coe and Fox 1942). The average amount of
water filtered by M. californianus decreases with age (Fox,
Sverdrup, and Cunningham 1937) and as a possible consequence,
the amount of DDT taken up from the environment via both the
water and phytoplankton may decrease. Mussels may also cease
filtering when disturbed. Jørgensen (1960, 1966) was able to
obtain normal filtering rates in the lab only from very small
mussels. Furthermore, though a mussel normally feeds 97-99%,
of the time (Loosanoff 1942), it may stop eating when disrupted,
the younger ones adjusting more quickly to experimental situations.
In addition, a mussel may transport water without feeding if
the sheet of mucus normally covering the gills is not present
(Macginitie 1941). As a result, a mussel could take up more
DDT directly from the water than through feeding on phytoplankton.
The results of this study show that substantial quantities
of DDT are obtained directly from the sea water. Furthermore,
they suggest that this mode of entrance may be even more impor¬
tant in the uptake of DDT than the accumulation from feeding on
contaminated food materials. However, more information is
