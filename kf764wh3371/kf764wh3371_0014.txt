Figure 1. The solid colored bars represent organisms
from Seal Rock, the horizontally crossed bar an organism from
Point Joe, and the cross-hatched bar an organism from Cabarillo
Point. The first three bars show mean DDE levels for 50, 10.
and 6 mussels, respectively, while the last three show levels
for individual animals.
Figure 2. Each graph shows the uptake over a 12-hour
period of C-DDT directly from the water by a l cm., a 3 cm..
and a 5 cm. Mytilus incubated together in the same jar. The
initial C+-DDT concentration was 1.0 p.p.b. in 780 ml. filtered
sea water.
Figure 3. Each line represents the uptake over a 12-hour
period of C-DDT from Nitzschia by a l cm., a 3 cm., and a
5 cm. Mytilus incubated together in 780 ml. filtered sea water.
