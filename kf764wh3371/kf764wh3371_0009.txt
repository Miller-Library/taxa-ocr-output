DDT does not appear to harm the phytoplankton (Bailey 1969).
The bottles were periodically shaken to keep the phytoplankton
in a uniform suspension, and at the end of the incubation
period, the solution was centrifuged and rinsed twice with
filtered sea water to remove any DDT which might have adsorbed
to the surface of the phytoplankton. The phytoplankton were
then introduced to four experimental jars with 3 organisms each,
one from each size class. About 2.5 x 10' cells were provided
per container. Both the experimental conditions in the jars
and the treatment of the animals at the end of the 12-hour
incubation period were identical to those in the experiments
with C uptake from water alone.
ESULTS
Assays with the gas chromatograph revealed a distinct
difference in DDE levels in organisms of different sizes but
a minimal difference between organisms from different areas
(Table 1, Figure 1). Total DDE content was seen consistently
to decrease with increasing size of the organisms. The concenÂ¬
tration of DDE is expressed in terms of wet weight of all the
body tissues combined. Table II shows the correlation between
wet and dry weight for the three size classes. However, the
relationship between size class and DDE level appears to be
identical whether plotted against wet weight or dry weight.
The experiments with the uptake of C+-DDT directly from
the water revealed a similar trend of DDT accumulation with size.
