INTRODUCTION
Slightly over twenty years ago the introduction of DDT to
the world environment was received as the great panacea for the
control of insect pests of man's food crops. Furthermore, its
success in controlling malaria and other human diseases carried
by insects was undeniable. Only recently, however, have studies
of the long-term effects of DDT on non-target organisms begun
to cause alarm. Concern is growing now over the discovery that
although the actual DDT concentration in the oceans is only
in the order of 5-15 parts per trillion, DDT is taken up by
phytoplankton and then passed along the food chain through
zooplankton, fish, and birds where it may reach toxic levels
(Risebrough, Reiche, Peakall, Herman, and Kirven 1968; Risebrough,
Menzel, Martin, and Olcott 1967; Hickey and Anderson 1968).
The organism studied, Mytilus californianus, is a common
species of the intertidal region of the Monterey Bay area.
As a filter feeder it transports large quantities of water
through the mantle cavity. Many suspended nonliving particles
and small living organisms also enter with the water, come into
contact with the ctenidia and may or may not be picked up by
the palps and passed through the alimentary tract. It was sus-
pected that DDT might be accumulated from contact with water
passing through the mantle cavity as well as from particles of
