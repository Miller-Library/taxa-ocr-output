is inactivating since it is Ca2+ dependent. B current increasingly
decays as Ca2+ is extruded from the cell by a Ca2+ pump. As C
current decays, the membrane can once again undergo depolarization
so that B current can be activated. The the series of action potentials
çan be fired once again.
Furthermore, several ambiguities still exist on the regulation of
intracellular calcium concentration. The exact concentration of free
Ca2+ is hard to detect since it is involved in several mechanisms. In
the model, the factors affecting calcium are separated into three

processes:
1) influx across the cell surface membrane
2) the efflux across the surface membrane
3) the intracellular diffusion and binding of Ca
Firstly, Ca2+ may primarily influx by channels of the B and D
currents, while the efflux is activated by a Ca2+ extrusion pump. It is
activated in approximately direct proportion to the concentration of
calcium at the inner surface membrane. The free intracellular Ca2+ is
hypothesized to diffuse according to Fick's Law of diffusion. In

äddition, it is assumed that Ca2+ is subject to several sequestration
reactions and buffering once it enters the cell. In this study, the
extracellular Ca2+ concentration was varied from a low to high
concentration. These extreme conditions could contribute in
exhibiting calcium's primary roles in the burst pacemaking activity¬

to discover if the cell would adapt to the altered conditions in a
homeostatic fashion or if it would change its firing pattern in a
predictable pattern. This paper attempts to elucidate more on
calcium's specific roles in this rhythmic pattern of firing.
