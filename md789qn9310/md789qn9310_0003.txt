period. (Johnston, 1978: Gormann and Hermann, 1979). The
concentration of the intracellular Ca2+ could also be a regulatory
determinant, for it has been found that injecting Ca2+ into cells had
produced an outward current which had significant magnitude to
create the postburst hyperpolarization.(Gormann and Thomas, 1977).
The outward current could be directly activated by the free calcium
ions which are found in close proximity to the inner membranes.
Although information has been found on these currents, the specific
details on which conductances are the most crucial at different points
in the cycle has not been completely elucidated.
Smith and Thompson have created a Ca2+ - coupled model which
describes when these ionic currents are highly activated or in a state
of decay. The three currents of central importance are the:
1) B current, slow Ca2+ and Nat current, activates rapidly during
depolarization
2) D current, fast Ca2+ current, responsible for the greatest influx of
Ca2t
3) C current, slow Ca2+ dependent K current, decays within 20-30
seconds back to repolarization.
The bursting pattern appears to be caused by an interaction of these
three currents. At the start of the cycle with the first action
potential, the depolarizing pulse activates the fast D current and slow
B current. Simultaneously, C current is activated, yet at a slower rate
than B, so the depolarizing action potentials proceed. B current is
soon saturated, and so much Ca2+ has accumulated near the cell
membrane that C current reaches larger values of activation. Thus,
the firing pattern terminates, and the silent pattern of
hyperpolarization begins. While B current decays, the C current also
