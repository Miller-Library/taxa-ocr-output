figure 1. Diagram of a dorsal view of the abdominal ganglia from
Aplysia californica, R15 and LOB cells were used in the experiments.
firgure 2. Diagram of the experimental set-up with the constant
perfusion system(drip and suction system) and a single
microelectrode in cell.
figure 3. Graphs of Various Computer Runs on Smith and Thompson's
Model (A) Computer Run of Increased Pump Rate at 5.0 E* as
compared to 0 [Ca2+0 experimentally (B)Computer Run with no
parameters altered, pump rate at 4.0 E* as compared to control (C)
Computer Run with Decreased Pump Rate at 3.0 E* as compared to
60 mM Ca2+ experimentally
figure 4. Average Burst Durations in .01, 10, and 60 mM Ca2+
solutions. Burst durations were measured for single periods.
Measurements were taken from the last 10-15 periods in each saline
to ensure saturation of the solution.
figure 5. Average Number of Spikes per Burst. The number of spikes
per individual burst was measured in .01, 10, and 60 mM Ca2+
Measurements were obtained from last 10-15 periods in each saline.
figure 6. Average Length of Interburst Interval. The last 10-15
periods of silent hyperpolarization were measured in .01, 10, and 60
mM Ca2+
