Computer Modelling
I used a mathematical model of bursting pacemaker mechanisms
created by Smith and Thompson. The model is based on the ionic
conductances and other parameters which affect the Tritonia
bursting pacemaker pattern. Parameters were altered to simulate a
higher concentration and a lower concentration of extracellular
calcium. The Ca-+ extrusion pump rate constant was increased in
order to mimic the results of lowering external calcium
concentrations. This would allow the same amount of Ca2+ to enter
the cell, yet it would be pumped out of the cell more rapidly. Thus,
the C current would not be as highly activated. To simulate high
external calcium, the pump rate was decreased so that the external
Ca2+ concentration was maintained, yet the calcium remained in the
cell for a longer period. In this manner, the cell's Ca2+ dependent
potassium current would be highly activated for a much longer time.
