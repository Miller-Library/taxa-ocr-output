action potentials for all the cells, and the average length of the
interburst interval for the two types of cells. In the unaltered
model which was juxtaposed to the control ASW, the burst duration
lasted 19 seconds with 17 spikes per burst. The interburst interval,
on the other hand, had a duration of 63 seconds. For all the
experimental cells, the measurements appear to have lower values
Both the RI5's and the LOB's have average burst durations of 18 and
3.55 seconds respectively, while there are five action potentials per
burst in the control solution. Finally the interburst intervals were
also shorter, 52 seconds for the R15's, 24 seconds for the LOB's, as
compared to the 63 second interburst interval in the model.

In Figure 3, the computer model in the control(lOmM Ca2*) is
depicted in the center while the computer runs which parallel high
and low extracellular Ca2+ are also shown. Those with altered
parameters had distinct changes of shortened burst durations and

lengthened interburst intervals in high Ca2+. This occurred because
Ca2+ remained in the cell for a longer period with a decreased pump
rate, which caused the activation of C current. With low calcium, the
model predicted increased burst durations and decreased interburst
intervals because calcium was extruded more quickly. Thus C
current was not activated for very long, and the hyperpolarizing
force was decreased.
As seen in Figure 4, the different cells were subjected to 0, 10,
and 60 mM Ca2+ artificial sea water. In the model, the average burst
durations decreased with increased calcium concentrations. The
burst durations were 3.28 times longer in the 0 Ca2+ as compared to
the control saline, while they were 1.9 times longer in the 60 mM
