and low intracellular calcium. Their recrurrent, bursting patterns
could be compared to the bursting characteristics in high and low

concentration could then be monitored by using fluorescent dyes
such as fura-2. More information could be found out about the
mechanism of the Ca pump. If it was Ca2+ dependent, then Ca-
should be extruded at a faster rate with a higher concentration of
intracellular Ca2+
