intervals should be longer. Since the extracellular Ca2+ concentration
is much greater than the intracellular concentration, if the Caz
pump which extrudes Ca2+ from the cell is concentration dependent,
then Ca2+ will remain in the cell for a longer period than in the
control solution. C current will maintain activation, and the
interburst interval will be lengthened by the two effects of greater
calcium load and the concentration gradient.
2) In 0 Ca2+ solution, the influx will be lessened so that minute
amounts or no calcium will enter the cell through B and D currents.
Therefore, no Ca2+ binding will occur, and calcium channels will not
be inactivated by Ca2+. Additionally, C current will not be activated.
In this way, the typical periods of hyperpolarization will also be
absent. Either continuous, repetitive firing will occur, or the burst
durations will be lengthened. The absence of C current will either
completely abolish the periods of hyperpolarization or shorten their
durations.
The most striking finding of this study is that extracellular Caz
affects the length of the burst durations by decreasing their duration
in increased Ca2+ salines and increasing the duration in 0 Ca2+ salines.
This is consistent with the idea that the coupled interaction of the
Ca2+ inward currents with the Ca2+ dependent K+ current determines
the length of the burst duration. The experimental results match the
prediction of the model. In 0 Ca2+ solutions, no Ca2+ would influx, and
the burst durations would be altered because the B, D, and C current
are either present with extremely decreased conductance or absent.
The normal, continuous firing still occurs, however, because other
currents such as the fast sodium and slow potassium currents are
