DISCUSSION
By altering the extracellular amount of Ca2+ several factors
could be affected such as the influx of Ca2+ across the cell surface, the
efflux across the surface membrane, and the intracellular diffusion
and binding of Ca2+ to different sites. I developed a hypothesis on
how the bursting pacemaker pattern would be transformed in higher
and lower extracellular Ca2+ based on the model.
1) In the high calcium saline solution, it was predicted that a
greater calcium influx would occur because of the new availability
and greater concentration gradient. Both the slow, inward Ca2+ or B
current and the fast, inward Ca2+ or D current would be activated to a
greater extent. As a result, the B current would saturate more
rapidly in comparison to the control solution. In addition, more
calcium channels would inactivate as a result of greater Ca2+ binding
to the channel. While the B and D current are active, Ca2+ rushes into
the cell and accumulates near intracellular membrane. This leads to
a greater activation of the Ca2+-dependent B current because Caz
binds and activates these channels which cause hyperpolarization of
the cell. This hyperpolarization eventually terminates the burst of
action potentials more rapidly than in the control solution. In the
model, the Ca2+ extrusion pump is activated in direct proportion to
the intracellular concentration of submembranous Ca2+ If this is
valid, the Ca2+ pump should have a larger activation value with the
higher Ca2+ concentration. The decrease of Ca2+ concentration still
occurs more slowly than the control, though, because of the increased
Ca2+ load from the inward B and D currents. Thus, the interburst
