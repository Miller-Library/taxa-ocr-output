RESULTS
Five bursting pacemaker cells, two RI5 and three LOB cells were
flushed with different physiological salines of 0 Ca2+, artificial sea
water with 10 mM calcium, and 60 mM calcium; their membrane
oscillations were recorded.
The RI5's and LOB's were separated into
two groups because of their varying characteristics. One of the LOB
cells which was recorded was silent upon microelectrode
impalement, so the measurements were taken after the cell had been
stimulated with seretonin. The LOB's were recorded for
approximately 2.7 hours, while the RIS's were monitored for an
average of 5.3 hours.
In the 10 mM Ca2+ ASW solution, before any solution changes,
there were some variations between the LOB and RI5 cell firing
patterns. The R15 cells fired 3-5 action potentials per burst, and the
burst durations were approximately 3.22 seconds long. The
interburst intervals were 83.99 seconds on average for the two R15
cells. The LOB's, on the other hand, had much shorter burst
durations with two cells which had a single spike per burst in ASW.
The other cell, however, had bursts lasting 8.73 seconds with 7-8
spikes per burst. The interburst intervals for the LOB's were much
shorter on average than the R15 cells, lasting 34.7 seconds.
Several parameters were measured in order to compare Smith
and Thompson's model to the experimental cells- the average length
of the burst durations for the RI5's and LOB's, the average number of
