INTRODUCTION
Bursting pacemaker cells are present in a variety of living

organisms from human beings to mollusks. These neurons fire in a
repeating cycle of a train of action potentials, followed by a quiescent
period of hyperpolarization. This firing pattern is involved in the
regulation of constant, rhythmic activities such as respiration,

peristalsis, sensory perception, and circadian rhythms. In the
Aplysia californica, the R15 bursting pacemaker neuron may signal
peptide release for homeostatic osmotic regulation.
Several models from RI5 bursting pacemakers have been
developed in order describe how this mechanism of firing may be
controlled, yet a quantitative characterization of the membrane
conductances has not yet been produced.
In the theory presented
by Thompson and Smith on bursting pacemaker cells in the Tritonia
nudibranch, the recurrent, firing pattern is depicted as being under
7
the regulation of a calcium-coupled system. In their studies, two
ionic conductances have been pinpointed as the major determinants
of the burst pacemaking activity. Other studies have also proposed
that one conductance is a slow, inward Ca2+ current found solely in
bursting pacemaker cells(Gormann, Hermann, and Thomas, 1981);
this conductance is voltage dependent and insensitive to
TTX(Thompson and Smith, 1987). The opposing slow, outward
current could be a Ca2+ dependent potassium conductance which
might cause the hyperpolarization during the quiescent
