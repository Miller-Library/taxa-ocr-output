interburst intervals should have remained constant. This hypothesis
can be rejected because the length of the interburst intervals does
vary with the different saline solutions. If the Ca2+ pump was
dependent on the concentration, the interburst intervals should have
been prolonged in 60 mM Ca and shortened in 0 mM Ca. In the

model, the interburst intervals do display this increase in length with
increasing Ca2+ concentration. However, while looking at the
averages from the R15's and the LOB's, no definite lengthening
appears as the calcium concentration is increased. The interburst
intervals increase slightly from the nominal 0 Ca2+ level to the
control of 10 mM Ca2*, yet they appear to remain stablilized at a
certain average when the concentrations are examined from the
control to 60 mM Ca2+.
This suggests that the Ca2+ pump does not function in simply - in
7
direct proportion to the intracellular Ca2+ as predicted by the model.
Some homeostatic mechanism could be functioning, so that the CaÂ¬
pump is regulated to maintain some steady level of Ca2+ if the cell
was stressed to extreme conditions. A positive feedback system
could also be active where with increased levels of intracellular Ca-
the Ca2+ pump would be increasingly activated. The mechanism of
this postulated homeostasis is quite unclear, so further
experimentation must be done.
The next logical set of experiments is to alter the amounts of

intracellular calcium buffering by injecting calcium chelators such as
EGTA. The extracellular concentration of Ca2+ could also be reduced
by replacing the calcium molarity with magnesium, and
subsequently injecting EGTA for the lum Ca2+ found in de-ionized
