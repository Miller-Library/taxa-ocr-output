still active. In low calcium, the burst durations were lengthened, yet
with high external calcium, the burst durations were shortened, often
reduced to single spikes per burst from the normal, multiple spikes
per burst. Increased [Calo causes a greater influx into the cell, and
this increased influx leads to a higher concentration of intracellular
Ca2+. This causes a greater accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ which
then leads to inactivation of Ca2+ channels by intracellular Caz
binding. Simultaneously, the higher intracellular Ca2+ concentration
causes an increased activation of the Ca2+ dependent K current. The
outward C current then activates at a larger value than the inward B
current. Thus, the burst duration is terminated more quickly.
Although the results from the actual cells match the results from the
model, the model depicts a greater change in the different salines.
This could be a result of the fact that this bursting pacemaker was
modelled after a Tritonia nudibranch, not an Aplysia.
The results from the actual cells also matched the predictions for
the model in the case of the number of action potentials per burst.
Similar reasoning for the burst durations help explain the lowered
number of action potentials in higher concentrations of Ca2+ and the
increased number in low Ca2+. A more highly activated C current in
the high concentration of Ca2+ results in a stronger depolarizing force
which makes it difficult for the cell to fire.
By comparing the lengths of the interburst intervals, I expected
to discover more about the method of Ca2+ extrusion from the cell.
While calcium accumulates in close proximity to the membrane, C
current would be activated, causing hyperpolarization. If the Caz
pump functioned independently of Ca2+ concentration, then the
