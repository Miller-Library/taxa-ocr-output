respectively, but the slope of the decrease is much steeper with the
model as compared with the actual cells.
While examining Figure 6, it is clear that the interburst intervals
lengthened in duration with increasing concentrations of calcium in
the calculated model. In 60 mM Ca2+, the interburst intervals are
1.59 times longer than in the control solution, and the control saline
has interburst intervals which are 1.19 times the size of 0 Caz
However, the interburst intervals of both the R15 and the LOB cells
did not increase as markedly. The interburst intervals exhibit a
small increase from the 0 mM Ca2+ to the control of 10 mM Ca2+. The
R15 cells have average interburst intervals which are 1.32 times

longer in the control than in the 0 Ca solution and the LOB cells have
interburst intervlas which are 1.23 times longer in the control as
compared to the 0 Ca solution. However, the interburst intervals for
both types of cells do not increase in length when the concentration

is altered from 10 to 60 mM Ca? This implies that the prediction of
increased interburst interval duration because of the highly
activated C current in higher concentrations of calcium is not always
valid. While looking at the detailed accounts for individual cells, it
was found that only 40% of the total cells mimiced the model and

had longer intervals while changing solutions from control to 60 mM
Ca2+ and returning to control. However, when examining the
interburst intervals which were altered from control to 0 Ca2+ and
back to control, 75% of the time the cells had shorter intervals during
the 0 Ca2+ wash as compared to the control.
