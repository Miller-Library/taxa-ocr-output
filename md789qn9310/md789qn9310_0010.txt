saline solution as compared to the control solution. The burst
durations of the R15 cells decrease in length with increased Caz
concentrations, starting from 0 to 10 to 60 mM Ca2+ This correlates
with the predictions of the model, yet the LOB cells display a deviant
behavior since the burst durations increase from 0 to 10 mM Cazt
while a drop in the length of the burst durations is visualized as the
salines are changed from 10 mM to 60 mM Ca. This deviation could
have resulted from the exceptionally long burst durations of one out
of the three LOB's which were tested. For this reason, the burst
duration average for the LOB's is unusually lengthy. While
examining the individual cells, it was found that 75% of the cells had
shorter burst durations in high Ca2+ as compared to ASW, while 80%
of the cells had longer burst durations in the 0 Ca2+ solution. This
manifests that burst duration, for the most part, increases with less
Ca concentration.
In Figure 5, the number of action potentials per burst was
averaged for the whole data set in the different physiological salines.
An increasing number of spikes with lowered Ca2+ concentration
levels corresponds with the lengthened burst duration with lowered
Ca2+ concentration. The lengths of the burst duration and the
number of action potentials per burst both display that burst
durations are dependent on the activation of the Ca2+ dependent K-
channels, since they undergo the greatest activation with higher
amounts of intracellular Ca2+ The model also exhibits a decrease
number of action potentials with increased calcium concentrations
from 39 to 19 to 9 in 0 mM, lOmM, and 60 mM Ca concentrations
