ABSTRACT

Autorhythmic bursting pacemaker cells have been hypothesized
to function by a calcium-coupled system. Bursting pacemaker cells
in Aplysia californica, the RI5's and LOB's were flushed with saline
solutions containing .01, 10, and 60 mM concentrations of Cazt
I found that the burst duration is affected by the extracellular
concentration of Ca2+, shortening in high Ca2+ and lengthening in low
Ca2+ solutions. This is consistent with an increase and a decrease in C
current(calcium dependent potassium current) activation. The
mechanism behind the interburst interval, however, is still unclear.
The changes in its duration point to a homeostatic mechanism.
