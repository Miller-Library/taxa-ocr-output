found only between decreasing hematocrit and an increasing ratio of ketamine to
medetomidine (Figure 9). All other correlations and parameters in bonito were not
analyzed due to small sample size.
Discussion
Intramuscular Anesthesia
Distinct differences in anesthesia induction times were found between the three
scombrid species. This correlates with the differences in metabolic rate. The yellowfin,
with the highest metabolic rate, would be expected to respond to ketamine and
medetomidine most rapidly of the three species. The mackerel, conversely, with the
slowest metabolic rate would be expected to have the longest anesthetic induction period.
Bonito, with a metabolic rate similar to the yellowfin, but less red muscle capillarization,
would be expected to have intermediate induction times. This anticipated pattern is
reflected in the minimum induction time found in yellowfin and maximum induction
period in mackerel. However, induction time in bonito was not significantly different
from that in the yellowfin tuna. This result may be due to the small sample size of the
experiments. On the other hand, it is more likely that it reflects the importance of
metabolic rate rather than muscle capillarization in anesthetic induction.
Despite the differences in the three species' induction time, the data on average time
to release seem to contradict a metabolic explanation. The mackerel have an significantly
shorter time to release as compared to both bonito and yellowfin. Time to release was
defined as the time from injection of atipamezole until the release of the fish from the
sling. At this point, the fish showed a regular tailbeat and signs of righting itself, and was
also attempting to swim. Subjectivity of this measurement could have contributed to the
high variance and the lack of significant difference between time to release of yellowfin
