m diameter tank. Weights were estimated based on the relative size of the fish in the
tank, and doses were measured as in yellowfin tuna. A pre-determined volume of drug
was injected into the red muscle, as guided by the location of the pectoral fin, and the fish
was floy tagged. The fish was released and induction of anesthesia was observed. When
the fish was determined to be sufficiently anesthetized, the fish was returned to the sling,
or netted and then placed in the sling. At this point ventilation was started as before, and
a curved length of the fish was taken. Additionally, 3 bonito were weighed, in order to
obtain more accurate dosage information. The bonito underwent the same blood
sampling procedure as in the tuna; however, mackerel were neither weighed nor was their
blood sampled, due to their small size. The predetermined dosage of atipamezole was
then injected into the red muscle, and the fish was kept in the sling until an attempt to
swim or escape was made. We then released the fish and observed from the side of the
tank. Observations followed the same procedure as in yellowfin, but video was not
recorded due to lack of assistance.
Immersion Anesthesia
One yellowfin tuna and one bonito were anesthetized using MS-222. These
experiments began with the preparation of the anesthetic bath. A 1 g/L solution of MS-
222 in seawater was used, with a total volume of 30 L. As tricaine causes acidification of
seawater, which could lead to undesirable physiological effects in the fish, the drug was
buffered with 2 parts sodium bicarbonate per one part MS-222. 30 g of MS-222 and 60 g
of sodium bicarbonate were measured and placed in a container holding 30 L of filtered
seawater. The solution was then bubbled with an airstone for one hour. 10 L of the
bubbled solution were placed in a large cooler and another similarly sized cooler was
filled with pure seawater.
