technique. On the other hand, while viability of the anesthetic regimen in bonito and
mackerel seems reasonable, it too needs to be further investigated. Discrepancies in
procedural technique need to be eliminated, and an alternate handling method for
mackerel must be devised. Additionally, with further studies, the correlation between
bonito blood parameters and anesthetic drugs can be better elucidated. This could
perhaps add to the promise of this technique in blood sampling, as a baseline bonito
blood chemistry could be determined. In all, the limited results of this project should not
be viewed as the failure of intramuscular anesthesia in yellowfin tuna, nor should they be
regarded as the success of ketamine and medetomidine in bonito or mackerel.
