222 and behavioral and physiological effects were monitored, so that MS-222 could be
compared and contrasted with the intramuscular anesthesia regimen.

The initial dosage applied in the study was 4 mg/kg ketamine and 0.4 mg/kg
medetomidine, and was determined from the preliminary work performed by Williams
and Block (personal communication). Atipamezole was always applied in the same dose
as medetomidine. Commercial versions of ketamine hydrochloride (Ketasat - Fort Dodge
Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) and medetomidine (Domitor - Orion, Espoo, Finland) were
used, in concentrations of 100 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml in saline, respectively. An
experimental version of atipamezole (Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, CO) was
used, in a 5 mg /ml saline solution. Applied doses of the drugs varied from the ideal dose
depending on the actual weight of the fish, as well as human error.
A partial double dose study was performed (Figure 1). Experimental protocol varied
for the three species. For the 5 yellowfin tuna, the water level in the 10 m diameter tank
was lowered, and 5 to 7 people entered the tank via ladder. The ladder was then
removed. A fish was selected and separated from the school, using a vinyl crowder. The
fish was herded into a vinyl sling, filled with water. The curved length of the fish was
measured, an approximate weight determined using a length vs. weight chart, and the
appropriate volume for the dosage determined. The ketamine/medetomidine combination
was injected into the well-vascularized red muscle. A ridge running laterally along the
fish was used as a guide to the red muscle, and drugs were injected directly ventral to this
ridge, approximately 5 to 10 mm posterior to the pectoral fin. The passive, integrated
