Data Analysis
Behavioral data were compared to ketamine and medetomidine doses, as well as to
the ratio of the two drugs. Stages of anesthesia investigated in the data were:
1. Period of anesthetic induction: defined as time from injection of anesthesia to
observation of fish being taken into vinyl sling, as well as being either â€œout", "under" or
otherwise relaxed, with a minimum of movement.
2. Time until release: defined as time from atipamezole injection until release of the
fish from the sling.
3. Time until recovery: defined as time from atipamezole injection until fish
recovers its orientation and equilibrium skills, as observed by fish avoiding objects in its
path and not listing in any direction.
4. Percent survival: defined as number surviving at present; deaths include those
attributable directly to anesthesia as well as those due to handling.
All averages of anesthetic stages were analyzed as mean, + standard error. Means
were then compared using a two-tailed Student's t-test for two means. Averages of blood
chemistry values were determined as mean, + standard error. Means between the two
sampling methods were compared using a two-tailed Student's t-test for two means of
unequal sample sizes. Significance to p + 0.05 was determined by comparing a critical t-
value to a test statistic; If the test statistic was greater than the critical value, the means
were determined to be significantly different, while if it was less than the critical value,
the values were not significantly different.
