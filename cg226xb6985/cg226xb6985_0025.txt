Figure 6: This panel measures the amount of alanine aminotransferase (A), creatine
phosphokinase (B) and cholesterol (C) versus blood sampling method in yellowfin tuna.
Sampling methods are anesthesia (left) and sling technique (right), and run along the xÂ¬
axis.
Figure 7: This panel shows the level of calcium (A), chloride (B), potassium (C) and
sodium (D) versus sampling method in yellowfin tuna. Sampling methods are anesthesia
(left) and sling technique (right) along the x-axis.
Figure 8: This panel gives the relationship between yellowfin tuna hematocrit, and either
ratio of ketamine to medetomidine (A), ketamine dose (B) or medetomidine dose (C).
Ratios or drug dosages run along the x-axis, while hematocrit is on the y-axis. For Figure
8A, the regression line equation is y = -1.04x + 39.45 and R2 = 0.64. For Figure 8B, the
equation is y = -2.28x + 40.22 and R2 = 0.28. In Figure 8C, y = 52.67X + 8.65 and R2 =
0.83.
Figure 9: This panel gives the relationship of bonito hematocrit and either ratio of
ketamine to medetomidine (A), ketamine dose (B) or medetomidine dose (C). Ratios or
drug doses are on the x-axis, while hematocrit is on the y-axis. In Figure 9A, the
regression line equation is y =-0.94x + 32.4 with an R2 = 1. For Figure 9B, y =-4.50x +
38.61, and R2 = 0.50. In Figure 9C, y =-21.21x + 37.85 and R2 =0.44.
