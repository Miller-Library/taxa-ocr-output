Figure Legends
Figure 1: The figure shows the design of the double dose study that was only partially
completed due to mortality. Medetomidine doses are along the top and ketamine doses
are along the side. (B) indicates that the dose was applied to a bonito; (Y) indicates a
dose was applied to a yellowfin tuna; (M) indicates a dose was applied to a mackerel.
Figure 2: The panel shows averages of induction period (A), time to release (B), time to
recovery (C), as well as survivorship (D) for yellowfin tuna, bonito and mackerel.
Standard error bars are included in the three graphs of time vs. species.
Figure 3: The panel shows the time until recovery in yellowfin tuna, as compared to
ketamine dose (A), medetomidine dose (B) and the ratio of ketamine to medetomidine
(C. Standard error bars are included only where the value given is an average. Time is
along the y-axis, while drug or drug ratio is along the x-axis.
Figure 4: The panel gives the average of time of induction, time until release, time until
recovery and survivorship versus the ratio of ketamine to medetomidine for bonito.
Where the average is based on a sample size of greater than one, standard error bars are
included. Time is along the y-axis, and the drug ratio is along the x-axis.
Figure 5: This figure shows the average hematocrit of yellowfin tuna, versus which
sampling method was used. The sampling methods are along the x-axis, and are
anesthesia with ketamine and medetomidine, or the low-stress sling technique.
Hematocrit is measured along the y-axis. Values are presented as means, with standard
error bars. Sample size for anesthesia is 5, and is 24 for the sling method.
