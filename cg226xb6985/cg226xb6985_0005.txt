activity of adenylyl cyclase, thus reducing signal transduction in the central nervous
system (Jalanka 1991). It has strong sedative and analgesic properties, and can be
reversed with atipamezole, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and competitive inhibitor of
medetomidine (Jalanka 1991). However, used in isolation, medetomidine is not
sufficient for general anesthesia (Jalanka 1991).
Ketamine is an anesthetic that causes selective, rather than general depression of the
CNS (Ryall 1979). Its benefits include rapid induction of and recovery from anesthesia,
as well as stimulation of heart rate and cardiac output (Ryall 1979). It is a
noncompetitive antagonist of glutamate (NMDA) receptors (Moghaddam et al. 1997).
Ketamine also has been shown to have minimal hematological effects in mammals (Hall
and Clarke 1983). However, ketamine does not provide sufficient analgesia to allow
intrathoracic or visceral surgical procedures (Sawyer 1982). It often increases muscle
tension, and also causes hallucinations in humans (Ryall 1979). In combination,
ketamine and medetomidine induce a general, short-acting, reversible anesthesia with
good sedative and analgesic qualities. This drug combination was chosen partially for its
success in previous trials, as well as the benefits of its characteristics.
Though intramuscular anesthesia is not currently in use at the TRCC, MS-222 (3Â¬
amino benzoic acid ethyl ester), a widely used immersion anesthetic, has been used when
an anesthetic is required. MS-222, or tricaine, is a water soluble anesthetic agent that is
absorbed through the gill surface of a fish. It has been thoroughly studied in several
teleost species, including rainbow trout (Gingerich and Drottar 1989, Kebus et al., 1992,
Iwama et al., 1989), Atlantic salmon (Hunn and Greer 1991), blacknose dace (MacAvoy
and Zaepfel 1997) and red drum (Thomas and Robertson 1991). MS-222 acts by
depressing central autonomic functions, and is known to have an asphyxiant effect
(Houston et al., 1971) One yellowfin tuna and one bonito were anesthetized using MS-
