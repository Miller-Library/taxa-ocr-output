Abstract
This project focused on the development of an anesthetic regimen in yellowfin tuna
(Thunnus albacares), bonito (Sarda chiliensis), and Pacific mackerel (Scomber
japonicus), while monitoring effects on blood chemistry and hematology. Anesthesia
was induced with a combination of ketamine and medetomidine, and compared to MS-
222 (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester). Ketamine and medetomidine were injected into
the red muscle of fish, while MS-222 was applied by immersing a fish in a drug and
seawater solution. Effects of anesthesia were monitored and blood samples were taken.
Blood was then analyzed for hematocrit, hemoglobin, enzymes, metabolites and ions.
Survivorship between the species varied, with yellowfin tuna at 0% survival and bonito
the highest at 50% survival. A trend relating an increase in time of the anesthetic
induction period to decreasing metabolic rate was noted. Additionally. time until
recovery from anesthesia was found to increase with the ratio of ketamine to
medetomidine in yellowfin tuna, but was found to decrease with the ratio of the two
drugs in bonito. Anesthesia was found to have no effect on average yellowfin tuna
hematocrit (mean level = 33.4 +2.2). However, a positive relationship between
yellowfin tuna hematocrit and medetomidine dose was noted (r2-0.83). A negative
relationship between bonito hematocrit and the ratio of ketamine to medetomidine was
also present. A significant increase in ions (calcium, chloride, potassium and sodium)
and some enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase) was noted in
yellowfin and was most likely due to the high levels of activity associated with
anesthesia. Further studies into this form of intramuscular anesthesia are needed, both to
better determine the feasibility of usage of the drugs in yellowfin tuna, and to ascertain an
ideal anesthetic dose in bonito and mackerel.
