anesthesia data, as all anesthetized mackerel received the same 5:1 ratio of drugs (Table
All three species anesthetized with ketamine and medetomidine displayed the same
characteristic behavior patterns. Ã„fter injection of anesthesia, a fish would begin to
increase speed, and fold its pectoral fins against its sides. As the anesthesia took further
effect, the fish would lose its equilibrium and orientation ability. The fish then lost its
tailbeat and experienced a relaxation of muscle tone in the last stages of induction. Once
under anesthesia, the fish would undergo discoloration, which lasted anywhere from
several hours to more than a day. Immediately following release, the fish would not be
able to orient and equilibrate properly. These skills were regained within 10 to 15
minutes of release. A fish would then enter a hyperexcitable and agitated state,
characterized by abnormally high speed, pectoral fins folded against the body, and a
general failure to swim with the school. In yellowfin tuna, this state was especially
pronounced and the fish never recovered. The agitated state was less severe in bonito,
and while it often lasted for at least one day, some of the fish did recover. Mackerel
experienced the shortest period of agitation, often returning to a normal swimming
pattern within the span of a few hours.
Immersion Anesthesia
Comparisons of the single yellowfin anesthetized with MS-222 show little difference
in time to anesthesia induction; the value of 3.42 minutes (min) is well within the average
yellowfin tuna range (mean = 6.73 min; S.D. = 3.50 min; Table 1). Time to release of the
MS-222 treated yellowfin is greater than the range for intramuscularly anesthetized
yellowfin, with a value of 17.98 min vs. a mean of 6.46 min (S.D. of 6.54 min; Table 1).
However, MS-222 measurements of time to recovery give a value within the range of
intramuscular values (17.98 min vs. mean = 12.39 min, S.D. = 8.36 min; Table 1). The
