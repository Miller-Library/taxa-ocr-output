ACKNOWLELUEMENTS
I would like to thank the faculty, students and
staff of Hopkins Marine Station for a very enjoyable
experience. In particular, I express my great appre-
ciation to Dr. Donald Abbott, Robin Burnett, Jim Rote
and Judy Peters for their help throughout this project.
I would also like to thank Phil Murphy for his help with
the gas chromatograph. Finally I thank Marsh Youngbluth
for all his help on the volleyball court.
