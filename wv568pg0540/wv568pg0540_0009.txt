SUMMARY
Pagurus samuelis were collected from eight locations
on the California coast between San Francisco and Los
Angeles. It was found that DDT residue concentration
levels at six of the eight locations were relatively low,
ranging from .6 ppb to 6.9 ppb. While levels at Monterey
Harbor (mean value 36 ppb) and White's Point (mean value
840 ppb) were much higher. Some possible explanations
for this difference are given. There was no significant
difference between levels in males as compared to ovigerous
females of the same populations.
