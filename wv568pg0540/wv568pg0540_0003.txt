been reported by Eisler (1969) for Pagurus longicarpus
and by Poole and Williams (1970) for the larvae of two
species of Cancer. There are no previous reports of
T residue levels in the family Paguridae. Paguru
samuelis was chosen for study because it is abundant
along the Californian rocky coast, occurs high in the
intertidal zone and is therefore easy to collect (Bollay,
1964). Samples were taken from various areas and tested
to determine natural levels of DDT residues in Pagurus
amuelis.
