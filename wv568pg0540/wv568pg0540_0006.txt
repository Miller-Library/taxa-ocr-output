5% DC200 and 6% QFl on 80-100 mesh Chromasorb W (acid
washed and DMCS treated). The column temperature was
200° C and the inlet temperature 220° C. The carrier gas
was helium. The identity of the DDT, DDD and DDE peaks
was periodically checked using the partition coefficients
established by Bowman and Berzoa (Berzoa et. al., 1969).



RESUE
AND DISCUSBTON
DDT residues in Pagurus samuelis are shown in
Table 1 and Figure 2. The levels of DDT residues are
low in six of the eight study areas with combined means
for the two sexes ranging from .6 ppb (parts per billion)
wet weight to 6.9 ppb. The remaining two study areas
have much higher concentration levels: Monterey Harbor
has a mean value of 36 ppb total DDT residues and White's
Point has a mean value of 840 ppb total DDT residues.
Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using
the Student's t-test (Simpson, et. al., 1960). The
difference in levels of DDT and its metabolites between
males and ovigerous females in the same population was
not statistically significant in any of the eight popula-
tions. Thus I felt justified in combining the males and
females when computing the mean concentration values for
each area. The populations at Monterey Wharf and White's
