populations and from each other at the.Ol level. The
remaining six populations do not show statistically sig-
nificant differences at the.05 level using this test.
The mean pesticide residue values for the Monterey
Harbor and White's Point do have relatively large standard
deviations. This can be partially explained by the
feeding habits of Pagurus samuelis. These crabs are
scavengers on both plant and animal materials. As a
result their intake of DDT residues by assimil√•tion from
food may vary widely from individual to individual. This
may be particularly relevant at the Monterey Harbor. Here
fish are cleaned, and heads and viscera are often thrown
off the pier; fish parts were observed in the area when
Pagurus were collected. Also located in this area is a
large storm drain. The runoff from the drain spills out
approximately 10 meters from the rocks where half of the
Pagurus were collected. This drain accomodates runoff
from yards and gardens in the Monterey area and may be
another source of DDT input. Although the use of DDT
is now regulated by the state, homeowners may still be
using DDT that was purchased before regulations came into
effect.
