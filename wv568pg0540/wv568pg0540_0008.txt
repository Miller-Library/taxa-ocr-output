White's Point correlates to similarly high values found
by Burnett (1971) in the Emerita analoga of this area.
The effluent from the L.A. County sewage system is dis-
charged from a diffuser that begins approximately 1.6
kilometers offshore at White's Point and diffuses for
another 1.6 kilometers. The sole producer of DDT in the
United States is located in L.A. county and disposes of
its effluent into the L.A. county sewer system (Burnett.
1971). Although the amount of DDT residues in this eff-
luent has decreased considerably in the last year, the
levels are still high, approximately 36.5 metric tons
per year (Cox, 1971). This probably accounts for the
majority of the DDT residues in this area.
The effects of DDT residues on members of the
Paguridae family are not yet well documented. Eisler
(1969) has established toxicity levels for several pesti-
cides for Pagurus longicarpus. The subtle, chronic effects
of pestioide residues may, however, be more important than
such dramatic short term effects. The effects of these
residues on reproductive behavior and larval survival may
prove to be particularly significant. It is perhaps into
these areas that research should now be directed.
