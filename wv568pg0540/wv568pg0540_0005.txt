the crab out. When possible five pooled samples of males
and five pooled samples of females were tested from each
area. Among the females, only ovigerous individuals were
used, and the eggs borne externally were removed before
digestion to assure a more uniform population. Each
pooled sample consisted of from three to five whole in-
dividuals depending on weight. The wet weights of indi-
viduals ranged from.5 g to 1.5 g. Total sample weights
ranged from 1.88g to 4.26 g wet weight.
Crabs were placed in small glass vials, digested in
a 50-50 mixture of 60% perchloric and glacial acetic acids,
and extracted with hexane (Stanley and Le Favoure, 1965).
All glassware was cleaned by first washing, then rinsing
in distilled water and finally heating for eight hours
at 375Â° C. Cleanup was done on a silica gel micro-
column (Kadoum, 1967) with .05 g of Nuchar Attaclay added
to remove pigments. The column was eluted with approxi-
mately 8 ml of pesticide grade benzene. Approximately
958-99% of the pesticide residues originally present were
recovered after digestion and cleanup. Samples were then
evaporated down to desired concentrations and aliquots
were injected into a Beckman GC-4 gas chromatograph
fitted with two electron capture detectors. The column
was Pyrex glass, 6', packed with a l to 1 mixed bed of
