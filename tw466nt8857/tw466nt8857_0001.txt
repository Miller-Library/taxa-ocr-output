Zonation in isopods. page 2
INTRODUCTION
Preliminary investigation of one end of a sand beach
at Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey Bay, California,
indicated that there were at least four species of ter-
restrial isopods living very close to each other in
apparently similar habitats. As the area did not appear
divisible into more than two zones, sand and iceplant,
I became interested in attempting to delineate the
environmental and behavioral factors that separated the
species. In the course of this investigation I looked
at tolerances to several stresses as well as the animal√∂s
behavior in the field. Analysis of gut contents was
ttempted but proved largely inconclusive. As the study
was carried out over a limited period of time, replicate
sampling under similar conditions of moon, tide, and
weather were not possible.
The species studied were Alloniscus perconvexus
(Dana, 1054 ), A. cornutus (Budde-Lunde, 1885 ),
hiloscia richardsonae (Holmes and Gay, 1909),
Armadilloniscus lindahli (Richardson, 1905), A.
holmesi (Arcangeli, 1933 ), and Porcellio sp. The
later species was not studied extensively due to the
low numbers encountered. There remains some doubt as
to the identification of Armadilloniscus holmesi, as it
