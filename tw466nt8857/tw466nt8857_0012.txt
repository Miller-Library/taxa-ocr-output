GUT CONTENTS
Procedure: Ten to thirty individuals of each species
were collected at night from an assortement of areas
(sand, rocks, wrack, grass, and iceplant as well as
traps ) and preserved in 80% alcohol. When possible
the animals collected were ones that had appeared to
be feeding. The gut was then dissected out, rehydrated,
fixed in Karo syrup and mounted on microscope slides.
They were then examined by myself and by Dr. I. A.
Abbott and the contents identified to whatever extent
possible (generally no farther than algae - vascular
plant - animal ). The relative proportions of the
material was estimated on a relative scale designation:
some, half, or most.
Results: A. perconvexus - Almost exclusively brown
algae, some other algae and vascular plant material.
This was true even for animals taken in the beachgrass
and iceplant.
A. cornutus - Evenly divided between algae,
vascular plant, and arthropod skeletons. The animal
matter was largely made up of insect pupae cases, and
made up most of the contents of several individuals.
Philoscia - Contained both insect pupae and
plant material, but very finely ground and difficult to
