Zonation in isopods. page 6
84% R.H. - KCl
100% R.H. - distilled H,O
The animals were examined after sufficient
time had passed for a sizeable number of animals to
die. The experiment was done at a room temperature of
20 - 25c.
Results: The results are presented in fig.2b. Note that
in order of increasing tolerance to dessication the ani-
mals are A. holmesi, A. lindahli, Philoscia, A. cornutus,
and A. perconvexus; also significant is that Philoscia
were in the 12 hour group. Although I did not test
Porcellio, they have been found by others to do quite well
for over a day at 80% R.H. (Fiedler, pers. comm.) which
is significantly longer than any of the other isopods
dealt with.
3) Submersion
Procedure: Fourty individuals of each species (note:
for the two species of Armadilloniscus only twenty ind-
ividuals were used ) were placed in open finger bowls
of sea water at room temperature. They were kept untill
almost all had died; death was again defined as a lack
of response to probing.
Results: The results are shown in fig.3. Note Philoscia's
low tolerance to submersion.
