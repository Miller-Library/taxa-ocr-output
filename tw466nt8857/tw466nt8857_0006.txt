Zonation in isopods. page 7
FIELD STUDIES
1) Static Distribution
Procedure: A point was chosen which represented the lowest
rocks on the beach. This was at + 1.5 feet from the
0.O tidal level. Ten meter transects parrallel to the
water were then layed down at one meter intervals from
the base point to the upper beach, a horizontal distance
of 9m. All the rocks that were small enough to turn
over and were touching the line were examined and the
substrate sampled. The number of isopods present was
estimated in incremental units of 25 (ie. - 0, 25, 50...
etc. ). The total estimate for each level was then
corrected to represent a sample of ten rocks (actual
numbers of rocks ranged from 7 - 13 ). Finally, each
increment of 25 was assigned a value of 1; the final
result being a scale of relative abundance from 1 to 38.
At 2 - 5pm on the same day temperature and humidity
measurements were made under representative rocks along
the transects. These are illustrated in fig. 4.
Note that this distribution was measured several
days after an unnusually high tide, and it may not be
"typical".
Results: The results are illustrated in figure 45.
