IYSIOLOGY
1) Temperature
Procedure: Ten to twenty animals of each species were
placed in petri dishes with a piece of wet towelling
to insure 100% R.H. The dishes were then left in
constant temperature boxes for 12 hours; mortality
at the end of this period was established by a lack of
response to probing. Tempenatures tested were 10, 20,
30, 35, and 10c.
Results: The results are shown in fig. 2a. Note that
the ranges of all species were very similar, with
Philoscia showing the least tolerance to temperature stress.
2) Relative Humidity
Procedure: Thirty animals of each species were placed
in individual cups to prevent clumping, which is possibly
a factor in preventing water loss (Cloudsley-Thompson,
1956 ). These were then placed on supports in covered
bowls of saturated salt solutions each giving a constant
R.H. The solutions and humidities utilized were:
98% R.H. - K,Cr,0
92% R.H. - KNO,
90% R.H. - Bacl,.2H20
