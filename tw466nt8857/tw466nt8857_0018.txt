Zonation in isopods. page 19
Armadilloniscus holmesi
This is a low beach herbivore, often submerged
by the tide. Their range does not overlap that of
any isopod but A. lindahli. They are active at night
or early morning when the sand has recently been sub¬
merged, which is a good time to graze on the microalgae
that makes up a good part of their diet (when the algae
is wet it will not be as tough or shrunken ). They
respond less to light than to humidity; this is probably
because their small size protects them from predation by
birds.
A. lindahl
These are found slightly higher on the beach than
A. holmesi, but feed on essentially the same things.
They are active only rarely, however, due to the infrequency
of very high tides. As herbivores need to eat fairly
regularly, this implies that they find a large part of
their food in the algae that is caught beneath racks.
Indeed, there were obvious deposits of dead algae under
almost every rock sheltering A. lindahli. Like A. holmesi
reatly sensitive to light. They range
they are notg
farther than A. holmesi when they are active; this may
be a mechanism of population dispersal, preventing pop¬
ulations under a given rock from stagnating.
