Zonation in isopods. page 10
heavy fog obscured the moon totally. Due to the lack
of a consistently reliable light meter, light intensity
was not measured. Temperature and humidity were moniÂ¬
tored on most of the nights, but proved to be relatively
unimportant.

May 3-4 (fig. 5 ) - Alloniscus and Philoscia both appear
to be strongly cued by the absence of light.
Armadilloniscus do not show such a response to light
and are active well into the morning; this is correlated
with the first direct sun on the beach and hence pos-
sibly dessication. None of the isopods appear to move
any significant distance from the areas in which they
are found during the day.
The data from May 29-31 (figs. 6 & 7) show the
effect of high tide on the animals. Rather than simply
shift their activity up the beach (Hainsworth, 1972),
the high water kept all species but the two Armadilloniscus
from appearing. The submergence of the zone 1 to om
above the base point on May 30-31 brought out a large
number of A. lindahli that did not show up the preceding
night.
