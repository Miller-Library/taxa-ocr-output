Zonation in isopods. page 17
photoresponse of Alloniscus is a means of protecting
the animals from predators which they could not escape
otherwise. Although no large predators were observed
on the beach at night, flocks of birds foraged on the
beach allmost every morning as soon as it was light,
A. cornutus also seems to respond negatively to
heavy surf, but I have no explanation for this, as they
were not active even in areas where there was no physical
threat to them of being washed out.
They travel to some extent, but probably go less than
1 meter in an average night. This is indicated by the
fact that while the populations as a whole do not move
noticeably, the directional traps found some evidence
for a definite cycle of movement during the night, down
the beach (to forage ?) and later back up.
Their diet is omnivorous but it is not known if they
are active predators or scavengers.
A. cornutus has evidently replaced the sandy beach
A. perconvexus in this rocky area, possibly because of
their greater tolerance for water (which is held in the
sand by the rocks) and/or their increased utilization
of vascular plants as food, represented by the beachgrass
common at the upper beach.
