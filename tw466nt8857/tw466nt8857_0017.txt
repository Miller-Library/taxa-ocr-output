Zonation in isopods. page 18
Philoscia richardsonae
These animals are a puzzle. They are omnivores, as
are A.cornutus, but the appearance of the gut contents
is very different. They are active regardless of moon
phase but are highly inhibited by heavy surf. Although
tolerance tests found them the most delicate of the
animals studied, they have the widest physical range.
They are the fastest of the isopods studied.
A possible explanation for all this was first
proposed by Nat Howe (pers. comm. ). Simply, the
speed and mobility of Philoscia enables them to seek out
isolated microhabitats in an otherwise hostile environment.
This implies to some extent that they are existing on
this beach only marginally, and should be more common
elsewhere. A search of the neihboring coastline revealed
a very dense population of them underneath concrete rubble
on a beach near the Coast Guard pier in Monterey, about
one mile north of the study area. Although they were
not studied at this site, it should be noted that they
were in an extremely sheltered habitat, often beneath up
to two feet of loosely fitting rubble. From this evidence,
I believe that the study area on Cabrillo Pt. was not a
representative habitat for this animal.
