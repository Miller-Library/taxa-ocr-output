Zonation in isopods. pagel6
Alloniscus perconvexus
This animal is found between the high tide mark
and the iceplant, buried in sand near rocks. They
were not found in significant numbers here, and little
can be said about their activity. Other researchers
(Hainsworth, 1972 ) have found them to respond negaÂ¬
tively to light, including moonlight. They are entirely
herbivorous, feeding mostly on brown algae (usually
Macrocystis).
A. cornutus
Also found on the upper beach, this isopod is more
closely associated with rocks, which may provide the more
constant high humidity that they recquire relative to
A. perconvexus. They are active only at night and appear
to remain inactive when the moon is out. This negative
response to light is found in both Alloniscus and possibly
Porcellio, to some extent in Philoscia (which ignores
the moon but responds to daylight ), and is allmost
absent in Armadilloniscus. A possible explanation for
this is that while Alloniscus are large, slow isopods,
Philoscia is very fast and Armadilloniscus are extremely
small. Small size or great speed are both good defenses
against most predation, especially that which is vision-
dependant. Therefore it seems possible that the negative
