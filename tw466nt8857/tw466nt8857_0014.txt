CONC LUSION
Although there seems to be a relatively homogeneous
habitat, the isopods on the beach studied have all
adapted to particular physiological and behavioral niches.
Of the six species studied, only the two Armadilloniscus
have the same diet. Physically, the animals are distriÂ¬
buted from low to high beach in accordance with their
tolerances to submersion and dessication, with one
exception (Philoscia ). Activity patterns are roughly
similar, all being primarily nocturnal, but within this
similarity there is great variation, with Alloniscus,
liloscia, and probably Porcellio responding negatively
to daylight itself while Armadilloniscus appears to be
responding to some other cue, possibly desication.
Moonlight affects the activity of Alloniscus cornutus and
possibly A. perconvexus (Hainsworth, 1972 ) but does
cia or Armadilloniscus. The
not alter that of Philos
activity of both these animals does appear to be related
to high surf, Philoscia responding negatively and
Armadilloniscus positively.
For simplicity, I will deal with the animals one
species at a time.
