Zonation in isopods.

Fig. 1
Beach profile from base point (0) to top of rise. The
horizontal axis represents the horizontal distance up the
beach; the vertical axis, the vertical rise in height
above O tide level.
Fig. 2a
Survival after 12 hours at 10, 20, 30, 35, and loc (100g
R. H. ). N for each species equals 10 - 20.
Fig. 2b -
Survival at various degrees of dessication. Times chosen
on the basis of casual observation of respective tolerances
to dessication. N started at 30 per point, but because
of escape from the holding cups and subsequent drowning.
n actually ranged from 4 - 28.
Fig. 3
Tolerance to submersion in sea water. The lines represent
number of animals (n - 10) left alive after a given
time interval.
Fig. la -
Temperature and R. H. measured under rocks every meter
up the beach from the base point. Temperature is repÂ¬
resented by the solid line, R.H. by the dotted line.
Fig. lb -
Relative numbers of animals at each meter above the base
point during midafternoon, when they are not active.
See text for explanation of vertical scale.
Figs. 5 - 10 - These figures show the number of animals (scale
in lower right) at any time (horizontal scale) and
distance above the base point (left vertical scale).
