Zonation in isopods. page 9
2) Activity Patterns
Procedure: The activity patterns of the isopods were
studied using plastic cups Ã´cm accross sunk flush with
the surface of the sand, into which the isopods fell.
A total of 13 such traps were distributed at various
distances from the base point described earlier.
Several of these were in directional sets, in which
microscope slides set in the sand were used to block
approach from all but one direction. These were set in
pairs, one facing up the beach and the other toward the
water.
Traps were checked at two hour intervals and all the
isopods were identified and counted; the two species of
rmadilloniscus were usually treated together due to the
ficulty of accurate field identification.
di.
After counting the animals they were released about
Im away from the trap in order to minimize the effect of
trapping on the population. Experiments in which the
animals were marked with enamel paint showed that there
was no significant recapture of just - released individuals
using this method.
Observations were carried out during three nights
with a new moon, two with a full moon, and one with a
first quarter moon. On one of the full moon nights a
