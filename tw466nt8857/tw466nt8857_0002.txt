Zonation in isopods. page 3
apparently is very similar to A. coronacapitalis and
reference specimens were not available to allow concluÂ¬
sive identification.
There is almost no literature relevant to the
habitats of either these five species of isopod or
similar beach inhabiting forms. Hainsworth (1972)
has studied the behavior of A. perconvexus and Hayes
(1969 ) examined the ecology of the isopod Tylos
punctatus in Southern California. Miller (1930)
looked at comparative distributions of isopods relative
to water, but his results were rather general in nature.
Mulaik (1960 ) stated that Armadilloniscus and Philoscis
were commonly found together under wrack, although this
was not found in the present study.
THE HABITAT
The area studied was the rocky end of a sand beach
located on the SW corner of Cabrillo Pt., Monterey,
California. The beach was made up of unbroken sand to
a height of + 1.5 feet from O tide level; there followed
a narrow (about 3m) band of scattered rocks and finally
at the upper reaches of the beach, iceplant. (See fig.
1)
Wave action was moderately strong but waves reached
the iceplant only once during the study peiod. Such
