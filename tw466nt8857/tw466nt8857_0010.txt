between this night and that of May 3-4, which has a
comparable tide but no moon, is the relative absence
of Alloniscus cornutus, while Philoscia and A.
erconvexus seem unaffected by the moon. The absence
of Armadilloniscus is probably related to the lower
high tide of that night.
Full Moon
May 16-18 (figs. 9 & 10 ) - The tides on these nights
were roughly comparable to that on the new moon of May
3-4, so presumably the major difference between the two
sets of nights was the amount of ambient light. In
this regard, note that on May 17-10 the moon was obscured
by fog, which seems to have made little difference.
The primary thing to note is the general similarity
between these two nights and the night of quarter moon,
as well as the close agreement between May 16-17 and 17-
18, in spite of the fact that the moon was not visible
on the second night. Note also that with a slightly
higher tide, Armadilloniscus have appeared in relatively
large numbers.
Directional Sampling
The results of the directional sampling are ambiguous,
and only selected data are presented (fig. 11 ). There
appears to be a tendency for Alloniscus cornutus to move
