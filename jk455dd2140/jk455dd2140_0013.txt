FIGURE LEGEND
Fig. 1. Maximum low tide temperatures in control, moderate, and drained pools. Times of low
tides shift from the middle of the day on May 16 to evening on May 22. May 24 is an
early morning low tide.
Fig. 2. Density changes were substantial: 5-47-fold increases in number of fish per liter.
Fig. 3. Density vs. Homing. Slopes of both lines are near-zero; at survey 2(day 3) y = 0.0009x
+0.3932. At survey 3 (day 7) y = 0.0149x + 0.3014 (P22.05 in both cases).
Fig. 4. Rugosity measurements are qualitative, based on a scale from one to five-five being
the most rugose (pools which were covered entirely in uneven rocky shelter) and one
being the least rugose (pools with entirely smooth sand or rock bottoms and sides). For
moderate and drained pools, filled bars are pre-treatment and shaded bars are post-
treatment.
