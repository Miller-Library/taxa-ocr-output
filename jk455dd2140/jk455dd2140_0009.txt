both time and space—may not have allowed me to observed actual changes in homing resulting
from the experimental conditions introduced. The clarity of the experiment would have
benefited from the addition of pools to the three treatment groups. With degrees of freedom
being as low as one for the drained group, the power of statistical tests was considerably
compromised. And it is highly possible that the limited time-scale of the experiment—one
week—may have been too short to reveal any changes in homing behavior.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1 am grateful to the many people at Hopkins who make undergraduate research possible,
worthwhile and fun. I would especially like to thank Jim Watanabe for guidance in all aspects of
this project; for helping me to understand the value of and challenging me to use good
experimental design, statistics, and critical thinking. Thank you to Joanna Nelson for
encouragement and help in the field, and Luke Hunt for help with statistics and field surveying
Thank you to Eric Sanford and Michael Webster for providing the materials and methods for
effective marking; and to Freya Sommer for helping me refine my species identification in the
first weeks. Finally I would like to express my gratitude to all 175H professors for providing an
intense and amusing introduction to real research.
