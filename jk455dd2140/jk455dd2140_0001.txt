Abstract
Previous studies of the woolly sculpin, Clinocottus analis, have revealed homing behavior and
site fidelity in this wide-ranging intertidal fish. The purpose of such behavior has been attributed
to the increased chance of survival for fishes that can recognize and relocate suitable habitat
during the daily fluctuations of submersion within intertidal zone. It should be equally important
to the survivorship of fishes to be able to respond to adverse conditions in tidepools to which
they home. The purpose of this study was to determine whether C. analis would continue to
home under experimental conditions that were expected to be unfavorable, i.e. the periodic
draining of the majority of water in tidepools. A field experiment was conducted at Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, during May 2001. Eleven pools between 0.430 m
and 1.002 m above MLLW in the moderately-protected region of the intertidal zone were
selected and assigned to three treatment groups: an unmanipulated control group, a group that
was drained by 78-98% on a daily basis for one week, and a group that was drained by the same
amount on three of the seven days of the experimental period. Fish in all pools were marked
with subcutaneous paint spots. Pools were surveyed twice during the experiment. Draining was
expected to increase maximum pool temperatures, density of fish and other tidepool organisms
and decrease rugosity of pools; and all of these changes were observed. Contrary to expectations
however, fish in all treatments maintained - 34% site fidelity/homing and did not respond in any
statistically significant way to experimental treatment. These results imply either that fish were
not adversely affected by the increased maximum temperatures, densities, and decreased
rugosities introduced, or that fish were affected, but homing behavior was not sufficiently plastic
within the time-scale of the experiment to show significant treatment effects between pools.
