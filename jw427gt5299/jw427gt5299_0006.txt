Stimulation of photosynthate release by E. hedgepethi homogenate
A homogenate made of the parapodial tissues of fed specimens of
E. hedgepethi stimulates an increase in the release of photosynthate from
isolated pre-loaded chloroplasts. (Table 1) The time course of release of
photosynthate in the presence of animal homogenate varies from that of
normal assay solution. (Figure 1) A fairly logarithmic curve reflects this
release. However, the release of a chloroplast suspension in assay medium
alone reaches a maximum in 15 minutes and remains constant up to 5
hours. (Milkowski, personal comunication)
lo insure that this result is not an artifact of an increase in the
osmolarity of the solution, l incubated the chloroplasts in 1.0 oSM
solutions. The solutions used in the isolation and resuspension of the
chloroplasts are normally 0.65-0.7 osM. (Shephard et al, 1968) There was
no significant difference between the 0.6 osMand 1.0 osM incubations.
