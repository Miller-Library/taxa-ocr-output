pre-incubated the suspension in the homogenate. Following this the
suspension was spun down, wached, and incubated in H'4CO»“. (Table 3)
Although the percentage release results varied in the two experiments, the
total fixed "C following the incubation were nearly the same, indicating
ono permanent damage to the photosynthetic capacity of the chloroplasts,
This was also reflected in the findings that no chlorophyll had leaked into
the assay medium of animal homogenate solution following incubations.
(Milkowski, personal communication)
Stability of the translocating factor
As reported by Gallop (1974), the effect of the E. hedgepethi
homogenate on the chloroplast suspension is greatly diminished by a 10
minute, 100 degree Celcius incubation in a boiling water bath. In fact.
found that the releasing activity of the homogenate was reduced to the
level of assay solution alone. (Table 4)
