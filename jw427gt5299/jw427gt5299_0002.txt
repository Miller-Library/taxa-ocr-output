photosynthetically active five days following isolation, although the
activity shows a marked decrease (Trench et al., 1973a).
Trench et al. (1973a) showed that the chloroplasts in E. hedgepethi
release a number of photosyntetic products, primarily galactose, to their
host cells. They estimated that at least 36% of the total carbon fixed by
the chloroplasts is released to the animal. Although different figures have
been reported, up to 10% of photosynthetic products are released from
isolated chloroplasts in a simple mannitol plus salts solution.
It was hypothesized that a factor exists in the homogenate of Elysja
viridis which stimulates this leakage of photosynthetic products (Gallop.
1974). Gallop found that the factor primarily exists in the
chloroplast-bearing tissues of the digestive diverticulum of E. viridis.
The factor is present in the clear supernatent of the homogenate and was
found to be thermolabile, non-particulate, and water soluble. No such
factor is present in a homogenate of C. fragile (Gallop, 1974; Milkowski.

My experiments investigated the properties of this factor which
seems to cause a permanent change in the activity of the chloroplasts
(Trench, 1973). Its thermolability, kinetics of action, reactivity with
