to lower the freezing point of the homogenate, leaving the homogenate
partially active. Finally, the time that the homogenate spends out of the
freezer should be minimized. Further experiments, including the addition
of protease inhibitors, could include forcing the homogenate through a
dialysis membrane to determine the size of the factor. This may be
difficult due to the presence of mucus, which may clog the dialysis pores
or make the factor stick to the membrane.

Iwould like to thank Rob Swezey and Denis Larochelle for their time and
advice, without which this project would not have been possible.
