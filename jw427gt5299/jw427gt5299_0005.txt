hours at 16 degrees Celcius. Two flourescent light bulbs at 10 cm were
judged to be sufficient light to stimulate photosynthesis (R. Zimmerman.
personal communication), and a preliminary experiment showed that this
system increased photosynthesis 6.8 x over isolated chloroplasts
incubated in the dark. The suspensions were centrifuged 12,000 x g for 1
minute and washed 2 times.
The various incubations (60 minutes at 16 degrees Celcius) were
under indirect room light. At the end of the incubation, the suspension
was centrifuged, the supernatent removed, and the pellet washed in fresh
medium. Fixed "C was assessed by resuspending the pellet in absulute
methanol and incubating this suspension at 50-60 degrees Celcius for 10
minutes; solids remaining in the extract were removed by centrifugation
before counting radioactivity.
Sample analysis
Excess H'â€œCOg was driven from the supernatents, washings, and
pellet extractions by adding 10% TCA and shaking the samples for 15
minutes. This was found to drive off 99.8% of unfixed 140. Acidified
samples were transferred to scintillation vials containing 5 ml Ecolume
