Abstract
A factor exists in the tissues of Elysia hedgepethi that stimulates
the release of photosynthetically fixed carbon from isolated Codium
fragile chloroplasts. The factor is labile at high and low temperatures.
non-particular, and predominantly present in the chloroplast-bearing
parapodia of E. hedgepethi. It may have a permanent effect on the release
of photosynthates without damaging the chloroplasts' photosynthetic
capabilities.
Introduction
E. hedgepethi is a saccoglossan mollusc which bores into
siphonaceous algae, extracts its chloroplasts, and incorporates them into
the cells lining its digestive diverticulum. These chloroplasts have been
shown by Trench et al (1973a) to remain photosynthetically active in the
slug. Hinde and Smith (1972) have shown that the chloroplasts may remain
functional more than two months after acquisition. Isolated chloroplasts
of C. fragile, one food source of E. hedgepethi, have been shown to remain
