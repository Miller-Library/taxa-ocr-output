Determination of the chloroplast concentration
A portion of the chloroplast suspension was added to 90% cold
acetone and centrifuged at high speed 12,000 x g for 10 minutes. Optical
densities were read at 663 nm and the following formula was used:
o.d. 775.05 = schlorophyll al (mMol) (Dawson et al, 1986)
Preparation of E. hedgepethi homogenates
Parapodial tissue of E. hedgepethi was gently blotted, weighed, and
disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer in the chloroplast suspension
mediumf of Shephard et al. (1968). The crude homogenate was
ultracentrifuged at 41000 x g for 60 minutes at 4 degrees Celcjus.
Approximately 70-80 mg fresh weight animal/mi was used in the crude
homogenate.
Experimental conditions and procedure
Chloroplast suspensions containing approximately 40mg
chlorophylliml were incubated with 10 microCuries Nah14co,/mi for 2
+ hereafter referred to as "assay medium"
