chloroplast. This reason, in addition to its thermolability, it was difficult
to characterize the factor. The factor may be a proteolytic enzyme itself.
lo investigate this possibility, addition of a variety of enxyme inhibitors
to the homogenization medium may be informative,
The hypothesis that this factor may be an enzyme was stressed in
my series of experiments. This is because the parapodial tissue used to
obtain these data contains a large amount of the digestive diverticulum of
the animal. The factor may be a variation of an enzyme used by other
saccoglossums to digest chloroplasts. That the factor is present in the
digestive tissues may explain its thermolability. When the lysosomes
rupt√ºre during homogination, the digestive enzymes they release may
destroy the translocating factor.
In order to expand upon and improve these experiments, a few points
should be considered. Increasing the number of times that a chloroplast
suspension is pelleted and resuspended seems to lower the activity of the
chloroplasts. The chloroplasts should be harvested from C. fragile
gathered the day of the experiment in order to maximize the retention of
their photosynthetic capacity. Also, E. hedgepethi homogenate should be
stored in a -80 degree Celcius freezer because the mucus and solutes tend
