not reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the chloroplasts, yet it may have
a permanent effect on the permeability of their membrane for certain
forms of fixed carbon, as was evidenced in the pre-incubation
experiments.
The time course of photosynthate release is interesting in its
comparison to the findings of Milkowski (personal communication) that
release in normal asay solution reached a maximum within 15 minutes,
The curve l obtained may reflect two different hypotheses. First, it may
indicate that an upper level of release exists, past which the homogenate
has no effect. Ã–therwise, it may be yet another reflection of the
thermolability of the factor. In my 1.5 hour, room temperature incubation.
the reactivity of the factor was greatly diminished. My logarithmic curve
could indicate that as the factor breaks down, the rate of reactivity
decreases. The 100 degree Celcius incubation of the E. hedgpethi
homogenate also supports this hypothesis. The factor appears
thermolabile at high and low temperatures in very short periods of time.
Although it is not conclusive whether pronase has an effect on the
stability of this factor, it is clear that pronase reduces the selective
permeability of the envelope of the extremely hearty C. fragile
