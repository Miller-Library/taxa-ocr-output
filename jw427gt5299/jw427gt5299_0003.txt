various enzymes, and permanent effects on isolated C. fragile
chloroplasts were investigated.
Materials and Methods
Collection and maintenance of material
Elysia hedgepethi were obtained feeding on Bryopsis corticulans at
the Moss Landing Harbor (California), and on C. fragile off the coast of
Santa Barbara, California. The animals were maintained in 9 degree
Celcius running sea-water tanks under normal daily illumination. They
were fed a mixed diet of B. corticulans and C. fragile,
Experimental and dietary C. fragile was obtained daily from Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California.
Isolation of C. fragile chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts were obtained from C. fragile fronds by the procedure
of Shephard et al. (1968), as modified by Trench et al. (1973a).
