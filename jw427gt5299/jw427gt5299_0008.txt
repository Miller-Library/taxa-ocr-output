incubated the homogenate at room temperature for 1.5 hours. This
produced a marked decrease in the translocation-enhancing ability of the
homogenate. (Table 5) In addition, an 8.5 hour, 4 degree Celcius incubation
produced similar results. (Table 6)
In an attempt to characterize this releasing factor, I incubated the
E. hedgepethi homogenate for one hour at room temperature in 0.1 ma/ml
pronase to determine whether the factor is a protein. As a control,
incubated the tissue homogenate and pronase against tissue homogenate,
assay soution, and assay solution and pronase. (Table 7) All four groups
showed greater than normal counts. In fact, assay solution containing
pronase showed greater release than assay solution.
Discussion
My experiments have shown interesting characteristics of the
translocating factor described by Gallop (1974). This factor is
water-soluble, present in the high-speed supernatent of E. hedgepethi
homogenates, and exctremely thermolabile. It causes a reproducable
increase in photosynthate release from pre-loaded chloroplasts. It does
