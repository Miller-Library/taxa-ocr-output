RESULTS
Video Footage
When viewed by video with the ROV, Atolla generally seemed
to pulse rapidly, often actively swimming away from the ROV. Atolla
was also documented to stop pumping, and would roll over into what
is designated as the "belly-up position. In this position the jellyfish
rarely pumps, but rather drifts with the current and allows its
tentacles to pile on top of its belly (Figure 1).
Collections
Out of the thirteen Atolla captured, seven were red and six
were white. The red jellyfish tended to be more active and to react
more vigorously to different stimuli. In captivity, the red jellyfish
lived longer than the white jellyfish (Figure 2). Also, the red jellyfish
tended to lose their pigment gradually from the moment of capture
until death.

White Light
When viewed in constant white light, Atolla consistently cycles
around the kriesel in the belly-up position (Figure 3). If kept in the
full white light long enough (about twenty minutes) Atolla may
partially spread out its tentacles (Figure 4).
Red Light
When viewed in red light Atolla tend to stay upright,
alternating between actively swimming and drifting in circles around
the tank (Figure 5). Only animals in extremely poor condition, which
have been in captivity many days (over seven days), drift in the
belly-up position when viewed in red light.
