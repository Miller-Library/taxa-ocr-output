Feeding Experiments
A variety of potential prey items were introduced into the
plankton-kriesel and any interactions were recorded over two to
seven hour intervals spanned over one to four days. Adult and
larval Artemia, Beroe, Aurelia, Nanomia, Pleurobrachia and gelatin
were all items used.
For nearly all the feeding experiments, only one type of
possible food was offered at a time. However, one experiment was
conducted on four Atolla in which both Pleurobrachia and larval
Artemia were allowed in the kriesel simultaneously. Twelve hours
later a tiny Beroe was added. Twenty-seven hours after the Beroe
entered, clear gelatin was added to the kriesel. Nearly another day
passed, and then more larval Artemia were added. After a few
hours, ten adult Artemia were added. Live animals were used as
prey and they were placed in the kriesel at least seven hours after
Atolla were caught. In some cases, Atolla would remain in captivity
many days before ever having an opportunity to feed.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Preparation of tentacle for SEM:
Small portions of
tentacles (about 1 cm long) were cut from a live, newly captured
Atolla. These specimens were preserved in three percent
gluteraldehyde and kept refrigerated. Further processing took place
within thirty-six hours. The tentacles were then washed with
seawater for five minutes, after which they were placed in 1%
osmium tetroxide for one hour. No buffers were used. Dehydration
