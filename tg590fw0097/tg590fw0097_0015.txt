ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First and foremost I must thank George Matsumoto for taking
me under his wing: spending hours of his time guiding me in lab
techniques, loaning source material, and advising me on my
presentation. Warm thanks to Annie Reese, my jelly-twin, who
shivered by me as we observed our animals in the coldroom and
kept me up when Raison and Pickle were getting me down. My
advisors Chuck Baxter and Bruce Robison, have been a tremendous
support and source of inspiration. Hey, Robie, what more must I do
to go down in Deep Rover? I also need to thank Kim Reisenbichler
for putting up with us in the coldroom he designed. Thanks to Chris
Patton and Tom Schroeder for help with SEM. Gil VanDykheusen and
Fraya Sommer, I appreciate your gelatinous gifts. Thanks to Lynn
Lewis and the entire staff at MBARI. Additional thanks to Alan
Baldridge, Mark Denny and the entire Hopkins staff. This project
could not have happened without the help and humor of Brian

Ackerman, Dave Bracher, Jon Consiglio, Craig "1.C. Darve, Steve
Etchemendy, Chris Grech, Roger Hayes, Greg Maudlin, Jim McFarlane,
Mark VandenBerg and Bill Wardle. Moral support from my
housemates (all six of them) was fuel for this project.
