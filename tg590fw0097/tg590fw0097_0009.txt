Full Flashlight
When Atolla were flashed with bright white light for a few
seconds, they would often perform the light reflex; either turn bellyÂ¬
up or dart away from the light source and then turn belly-up (Figure
8). This response was recorded so often and was so predictable that
Atolla could be "steered" to any specific area in the kriesel by
"chasing" it with the beam.
Moving Shadows
When Atolla was subjected to shadows created by white light,
it nearly always responded by performing the "light reflex" (Figure
9).
Sudden "Lights Out'
Many of the times that Atolla did not react to the flashlight
shining on them, they would react when the white flashlight was
turned off again. The animals would portray the characteristic "light
reflex," when the light turned off rather than when it was turned on
(Figure 10). Three out of the thirteen stimulations resulted in Atolla
bioluminescing around its margin.
Manipulations Once Animal Is Belly-up
If Atolla was already in the belly-up position it would not alter
its behavior unless stimulated to an unusually high degree. Stirring
the water in the kriesel was almost invariably followed by more
active swimming unless Atolla was already belly-up before the
disturbance began. Sometimes the jellyfish would turn belly-up in
response to stirred waters. Blowing bubbles through thin tubing also
resulted in more active swimming and pumping by Atolla, but was
