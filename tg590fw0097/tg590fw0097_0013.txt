reaction, more active pumping was involved; however, only a small
percent of the reactions involved the belly-up position. This
response to rapidly diminishing light intensity suggests that deepÂ¬
sea scyphomedusae, such as Atolla, share a similar reflex with many
shallow water hydromedusae, such as Polyorchis penicillatus , which
have a predictable "off-response" (Singla 1974). This "off-response
consists of an initial swimming contraction, followed by a series of
rapid successive tentacle contractions, finishing with several more
swimming contractions (Arkett and Spencer 1986). Such behavior in
shallow water medusae can be interpretted as a shadow reflex.
These medusae are normally exposed to sunlight but when an animal
swims above them a shadow is created. This type of shadow could
be caused by approaching predators and may be why the shallow
water jellyfish respond to rapidly diminishing light intensity.
However, this behavior is not so easily explained for deep-sea
medusae. Generally, only minimal amounts of light penetrate to 500
meters. Still, that may be enough light for the ocelli of Atolla to
detect. In that case, Atolla would be sensitive to very subtle changes
in light intensity. Possibly, the reasons for an off-response in deep-
sea jellyfish is based on different principals than the shallow water
jellyfish. Atolla may be reacting to alarm signals given by other
bioluminescent animals. Further research on this topic could lead to
a better understanding of the off-response in deep-sea medusae.
All these experiments combined, reveal that once in the belly
up position, Atolla rarely reacts with any further stimulus. This
suggests that the belly-up position may be a stress or alarm
response. By tucking in its tentacles and pulsing very infrequently,
