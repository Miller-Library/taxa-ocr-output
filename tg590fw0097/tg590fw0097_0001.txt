ABSTRACT
Few observations have been made on Atolla, a bioluminescent
deep-sea coronate scyphomedusa. With the use of a remotely
operated vehicle and a specially designed plankton-kriesel, Atolla in
the Monterey Bay have been videoed in situ, captured, and observed
in lab to learn more about their behavior. A characteristic response
to stimulation with light is described called the light reflex. The light
reflex consists of a number of quick pulses and/or the medusa
turning belly-up. Once in the belly-up position, Atolla rarely reacts
to any further stimulus. In addition, scanning electron microscopy
and light microscopy were used to take a preliminary look at the
nematocyst composition of the trailer tentacle compared to the many
short tentacles.
