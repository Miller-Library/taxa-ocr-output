Unlit Room
When viewing the jellyfish in an unlit room with a night-vision
monocular, Atolla behaved in the same way as it did under the red
light.
Thin White Beam
Shining a thin white beam on different parts of Atolla produced
varying responses. When the thin beam was directed at the bell
margin and tentacle-base region of an up-right Atolla, the jellyfish
would tend to turn belly-up (Figure 6) . Prior to assuming this belly
up position, Atolla would perform a series of actions such as rapidly
pumping, swimming away from the light source, darting all over the
kriesel, and finally rolling over. I have referred to this series as "the
light reflex, and have summarized it as "a number of quick pulses
and/or turns belly-up." Two out of the twenty-nine times
stimulated, a ring around the margin of Atolla bioluminesced before
turning belly-up. The light reflex occurs at different intensities for
different individuals. The red Atolla was more vigorous in all its
responses compared to the white. The white jellyfish was never
observed to bioluminesce and rarely darted around the kriesel.
When the beam was directed at the tentacles, the tentacles
were pulled in towards the bell and/or Atolla turned belly-up,
twelve out of twenty-four times (Figure 7). A number of quick
pulses were never associated with the thin beam directed at the
tentacles. The red Atolla reacted in this way more than twice as
often as the white Atolla. Shining the thin beam on any of the other
body parts did not seem to result in any consistent reactions.
