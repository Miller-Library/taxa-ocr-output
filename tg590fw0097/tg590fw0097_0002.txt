INTRODUCTION
In the past, because Atolla have generally been found between
500 and 800 meters depth, they have been relatively inaccessible for
behavioral studies. Even early anatomical descriptions of Atolla
were incomplete because the animals were caught in trawl nets
which ripped off their tentacles. In more recent studies of the
bioluminescent responses of Atolla, Herring noted that:
the observed physiological responses of oceanic animals
that have been caught in trawl nets rarely reflect the
true capabilities of these animals in situ. Better methods
of capture, maintenance and in situ observation are
needed in order to appreciate the full range of responses
which oceanic animals can employ and the circumstances
in which they are normally elicited. (Herring 1990)
Therefore, this study was conducted with a remotely operated
vehicle (Etchemendy and Davis 1991) both to view Atolla of
Monterey Bay in situ and to carefully capture it alive and intact for
further lab studies. These live animals were maintained in a
plankton-kriesel. This study has revealed that Atolla behave
differently in different types of light and that they share a similar
reflex, described as the "off-response" (Singla 1974; Arkett and
Spencer 1986), with many hydromedusa.
