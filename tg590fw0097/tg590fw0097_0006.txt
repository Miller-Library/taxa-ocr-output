with progressively increasing concentrations of ethanol began by
doing two rinses at 30% for five minutes each and then continuing
with washes of 40%, 50%, 60%, up to 70% at which point the
specimens could be refrigerated for up to twenty-four hours.
Dehydration continued at 80%, 90%, 95% and ending with two 100%
washes. The tentacle samples were mounted on stubs, coated with
gold, and then viewed with the Scanning Electron Microscope (Hitachi
S450, 15,000 volts).
Nematocyst Isolation
Protocol (derived from Weber 1987): Whole tentacles or large
portions of tentacles were severed from live jellyfish and washed in
cold distilled water. Keeping each tentacle in separate containers,
excess water was removed from them before they were frozen.
Further processing occurred within thirty-six hours. Each tentacle
was then thawed and homogenized with a pasteur pipette in a cold
solution of distilled water containing fifty percent Percoll. These
homogenates were placed on ice for thirty minutes and then
centrifuged for ten minutes at 5,000 rpm. The liquid, debris and
fragments were removed from each container and the nematocyst
pellets (which were often too small to see with the naked eye) were
frozen for less than thirty-six hours before being resuspended with a
drop or two of distilled water.
Light Microscopy
Squash preparations of the tentacles, nematocyst isolations, and
debris from the isolations were examined with an inverted
compound microscope (Axiovert 10) at 100, 200, and 400 times
magnification.
