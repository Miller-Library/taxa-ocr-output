never associated with the belly-up position. Touching the animal
often produced no noticeable response, unless the rod was touching
the area at the base of the tentacles by the bell margin. In this case,
three out of three times the jellyfish would pump away quickly and
turn belly-up. Furthermore, using the rod to move Atolla through
the water ended with the jellyfish turning belly-up. None of these
mechanical experiments resulted in bioluminesence. Recovery back
to active, up-right swimming took a variable amount of time and
required an end to all extra stimuli. This recovery occurred more
rapidly for Atolla in good condition than for Atolla in poor condition.
In fact, once these jellyfish have been in captivity for five or six days
and are beginning to appear unhealthy, they tend to remain in the
belly-up position more often than the up-right position.
Feeding
Atolla was never seen definitely using its tentacles to feed.
Two adult Artemia did drift into the mouth of one Atolla who
proceeded to swallow them. Additionally, at least three different
Atolla were seen putting one to four tentacles in their mouths when
larval Artemia were also in the kriesel. It could not be determined,
however, whether there were any larval Artemia on the tentacles
being used. Atolla were never seen placing their tentacles in their
mouths when larval Artemia were not in the kriesel. Other than
these observations, the jellyfish did not react noticeably to contact
with the other items offered.
