MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's remotely
operated vehicle (ROV) was used to view Atolla in situ. The ROV
provided video footage of Atolla under bright white lights and in
turbulent waters.
Thirteen Atolla wyvillei Haekel, 1880 and Atolla vanhoeffeni,
Russell, 1957 were brought back. One was collected with the suction
sampler on the ROV, the other twelve were collected in detritus
samplers on the ROV. These animals were collected at depths
ranging from 350 meters to 595 meters. Because of the delicate
structure of these creatures, species identification was difficult and
all specimens were referred to as Atolla. All specimens were kept in
à specially designed plankton-kriesel with a constant current, at 6.5
dégrees Celsius (+ 5 degrees), and with a salinity concentration
maintained at 34.5 parts per thousand (+- 1 part per thousand)
Red Verses White Light
The first two specimens were observed and studied in white
light. The remaining eleven were observed in a room lit with six
one-hundred watt red lightbulbs. The red light was adjusted with a
rheostat and all observations were recorded under two different red-
light conditions; either full intensity or half intensity. When not
being studied, these animals were kept in darkness except when
other people were working in the coldroom. The last eight Atolla
were kept in the same conditions except black plastic was used to
prevent any white light from reaching them unless it was an
intentional part of an experiment.
