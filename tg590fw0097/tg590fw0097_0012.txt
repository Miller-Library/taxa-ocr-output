DISCUSSION
These results demonstrate that Atolla has a stereotypical
response to both light and mechanical stimulation, namely pulsing
quickly a number of times and/or turning belly-up. Possible
reasons for behaving this way may be associated with interactions
between other deep-sea bioluminescing animals. For instance,
pushing a non-bioluminescing Beroe into the tentacles of Atolla
produced no response in Atolla three out of three times. However,
on the fourth manipulation, Beroe bioluminesced as it contacted
Atolla, and Atolla responded very vigorously with the entire series of
the characteristic light reflex, which included bioluminescing. It is
possible that mechanical manipulation of Beroe induced its
bioluminescent response as an alarm reflex, which in turn caused
Atolla to also perform an alarm reflex. Thus, the bioluminescence of
one creature may serve as a signal or warning to other light-
sensitive creatures that danger may be near. Further studies in this
area are needed before any solid conclusions can be drawn.
Results from the thin beam experiment show that the bellÂ¬
margin region and the tentacles were the most sensitive to light.
This correlates well with Arkett and Spencer's study on
hydromedusae which suggests that the ocelli, structures located near
the bell margin at the base of each tentacle, are the primary
photoreceptors (Arkett and Spencer 1986).
The results from the sudden "lights off" experiments
demonstrate that Atolla responds predictably by quickly pulsing a
number of times and/or turning belly-up. Whenever there was a
