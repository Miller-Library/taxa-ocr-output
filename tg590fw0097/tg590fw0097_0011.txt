Scanning Electron Microscopy
Differences could be discerned between the trailer tentacle and
the short tentacles when viewed under 400 to 10,000 times
magnification. A fine connective net tissue covered both types of
tentacle. Nematocysts were intertwined within that tissue, one of
which was found to have discharged (Figure 11). The connective
tissue and nematocysts on the trailer tentacle were finer and smaller
than the short tentacles, requiring more magnification to discern the
same amount of detail
Nematocyst Isolation
Both discharged and non-discharged nematocysts were
examined after isolation. Nematocysts averaging 10.5 to 11.0
microns diameter occurred in the long tentacle (Figure 12). In
contrast, nematocysts from the short tentacle were in much higher
concentration and consisted of both the 10.5 to 11.0 micron size
range and the 23 micron size range (Figure 13). They can be
identified as anacrophores and holotrichous isorhizas, respectively
(Purcell 1984).
