Thin White Beam With Red Background
To observe reactions of Atolla to white light, specific body parts
were stimulated. These include the trailer tentacle, short tentacles,
bell, and bell margin. This beam originated from two different
flashlights; one averaging 8.86 mE/m2/s and the other averaging
9.48 mE/m2/s when measured twelve centimeters away from the
light source. Each was taped up with many layers of duct tape,
allowing only a pinhole of light to shine through the tape.
Full Flashlight With Red Background
A full white flashlight was sometimes used both directly and
indirectly to observe the behavior of Atolla when moving shadows
were created in the kriesel and to observe how Atolla react to a
sudden, full beam of white light.
Unlit Room
A night vision monocular (Litton M982) was used to gather
information on Atolla kept in the darkness.
Mechanical Stimulation
Mechanical stimulation was used to catalog reactions of Atolla
to stimuli other than light.
Indirect mechanical stimulation: involved altering water conditions
around Atolla. Eddies were created by stirring up the water in the
kriesel. More subtle current changes were generated by using thin
rubber tubing to gently blow bubbles near an animal.
Direct mechanical stimulation; involved using a glass rod to
manipulate Atolla directly. Observations were recorded for all
experiments.
