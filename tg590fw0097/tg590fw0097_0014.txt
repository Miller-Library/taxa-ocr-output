Atolla avoids disturbing the surrounding waters, thus supplying
near-by creatures with fewer clues of its location. Additionally, dead
animals and debris are constantly drifting down through the water
column. Atolla may appear more like a dead animal or sinking
debris when assuming the belly-up position. This could deter
possible predators from choosing to eat Atolla.
The condition of the animal has been shown to be important in
that unhealthy animals or animals stressed by remaining in captivity
too long respond less often and less predictably than animals in good
condition. Because red Atolla respond more often and more
predictably to stimuli than the white Atolla, there may be a
correlation between the color of the jellyfish and its health. Atolla
which were red upon capture were noted to gradually lose their
pigment while in captivity. Further research in this area would be
very helpful.
Closer studies of the tentacles and of isolated nematocysts with
SEM and light microscopy revealed differences in the nematocyst
populations of the trailing tentacle as compared to the short
tentacles. Further research distinguishing differences between the
two tentacles and the significance of the trailer are much needed.
Though special care was taken to minimize stress to these
animals and to simulate a deep-sea environment as well as possible
methods could still be improved. When observing and collecting
Atolla with an ROV, red lights should be tried. Their sensitivity to
white light and their fragility suggest the importance of transfering
jellyfish into their kriesel with as little handling and disturbance as
possible.
