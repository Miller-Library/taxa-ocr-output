glycogen to a comprable degree, midgut extracts were found to release
greater amounts of reducing sugar from glycogen than starch over a
given time interval. This observation suggests a difference in the
specificity of the enzymes in these two tissues. The release of greater
amounts of reducing sugar from glycogen could be due to the action of
an alpha amylase in conjunction with a beta amylase. Combined activity
could degrade up to 80-90% of the substrate (Baldwin, 1957). Although
there may be inhibition of the enzyme near the branch points in glycogen,
an amylo 1,6 glucosidase may be breaking these branch linkages. This
ability would appear specific to alpha 1,6 glucose glucose linkages
since midgut extracts were found incapable of hydrolyzing the alpha
1,6 glucose galactose linkages in melibiose.
Amylase activity at pH 5.5 on starch and glycogen in the esophagus
of L. scutulata wasweak compared to that in L. planaxis. See figures 2
and 3. At plI 7.5 the esophagus of L. scutulata showed greatly increased
hydrolysis, while esophagus extracts of L. planaxis at this pl failed
to break down either polysaccaride.
Both the disaccarides maltose and sucrose contain alpha glucosidic
linkages. Snail enzymes hydrolyzed maltose quickly, but sucrose only
after an extended time. This indicates that probably two enzymes are
present. It is possible that the sucrase was studied not at its pl
optimum. Since beta fructosidase activity on inulin was limited to
the hindgut of L. scutulata, the sucrase is probably not a beta
fructosidase but rather an alpha glucosidase.
It is concluded that the carbohydrases in the littorines are
produced by the snails themselves; little reliance is placed upon inÂ¬
testinal bacteria during digestion. Vo attempt was made to characterize
