method, quantitative interpretation of experimental results is limited.
Although sugar increase by hydrolysis was always considered in respect
to the structural components of the polysaccarides and disaccarides
being tested, the exact proportions of different reducing sugars
present in the extractcontrols could not be determined. It is probable
that in this case hydrolysis of snail glycogen is occuring with glucose
the principle sugar.
Bacteria were isolated from the snail gut on a medium composed
of 500 ml. sea water, 500 ml. distilled water, 15 grams agar, 1 gram
peptone and 10 grams starch. A medium without starch but containing
filter paper was used to detect bacteria with cellulase activity.
Results
Active amylases capable of breaking down both starch and glycogen
were found in the midgut of both L. planaxis and L. scutulata, with
lesser activity per milligram of tissue in the esophagus. See figures
2 and 3. However, extracts of both tissues show an equal ability to
hydrolyze maltose, a disaccaride with the same alpha 1,4 linkage
present in starch and glycogen. This maltase was present in both
species. See figures 4 and 5. Alpha glucosidase activity for sucrose,
though positive for both tissues in both littorines, was weak compared
to the rate of hydrolysis of maltose. The alpha 1,3 fructose linkage
in turanose was split by the midgut of both species.
Cellulase activity was determined qualitatively by mixing enzyme
extracts with buffer and strips of Whatman #l filter paper, layering
with toluene and checking for increase in amount of reducing sugar
over the controls. Filter paper was dissolved overnight by mdgut
extracts from both species. Differences in ability to digest cell
walls of Porphyra and Ulva though not of Enteromorpha, Cladophora,
