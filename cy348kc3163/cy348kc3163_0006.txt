The only tissue containing activity for the 1,2 fructose linkages
of inulin was the hindgut of L. scutulata.
These results are summarized in figure 1.
Bacteria were cultured from the esophagus, stomach and digestive
gland of both L. planaxis and L. scutulata. Groups of both starved
and actively feeding snails were studied. Plates innoculated from these
different sources showed no significant differences after one week
of incubation.
Although a variety of bacteria grew, only the most common type,
one forming large white colonies, was positive for starch consumption
when tested with iodine. Vo bacteria capable of digesting either
cellulose or agar were detected after five weeks of incubation.
Discussion
Although at least one strain of bacteria capable of digesting
starch was detected, the presence of an active amylase in both eso-
phagus and midgut essentially discounts the possibility that intestinal
microflora are necessary for starch digestion. The lack of cellulose
digesting bacteria is also significant since coupled with the presence
of a very active cellulase in the midgut of both species and active
cellobiases in both tissues of both species, the cellulose digestion
of these herbivorous snails can be considered independent of the enzyme
contribution of bacterial simbionts.
Amylase activity on starch and glycogen appeared more active per
milligram of tissue in the midgut than in the esophagus in both L. planaxis
and L. scutulata. To the contrary, activity on the same alpha 1,4
linkage in maltose was comprable in both tissues. This would suggest
that the amylase and maltase are separate enzymes.
Although esophageal extracts of both species split starch and
