enzymes found in the gut of the littorines for pH and temperature
optima, specificity, or change in activity with change in diet. Yet
it is clear that whether by many specific carbohydrases or by a number
of general enzymes, both L. planaxis and L. scutulata are capable
of breaking down structural and reaerve polysaccarides and disaccar-
ides of the marine enviornment to monosaccarides which can in turn be
absorbed to provide energy to these snails
Summary
1. Enzyme extrots of the esophagus and midgut of Littorina
planaxis and Littorina scutulata were found to contain amylases
capable of splitting starch and glycogen. Only one strain of bacteria
isolated from these organs could digest starch.
2. Alpha glucosidase activity was detected on maltose and
sucrose. The alpha 1,3 glucose galactose linkage in turanose was
split by the esophagus of both species.
3. Esophagus extracts showed galactosidase activity on agar
and melibiose.
4. No cellulose digesting bacteria were detected. However,
cellulase activity was found in the midgut extracts and cellobiase
activity in both tissues of both species.
