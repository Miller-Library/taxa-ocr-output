content and the bacterial infestation of the gut. Both esophagus and
midgut (stomach and digestive gland) were tested. Midgut extracts also
included gonadal tissue which probably contributed a large amount of
inert protein. Thus, enzyme activity on the stomach and digestive
gland is probably higher per milligram of tissue than experimental results
indicate.
For L. planaxis siail weight ranged from one to two grams, average
1.4; esophagus wet weight range .0046-.0028, average .0037; midgut
wet weight range .032-.059, average .045 grams. Snail weight in L. scutulata
averaged .4018 grams; esophagus wet weight range .0018-.0021, average
.0020 grams; midgut wet weight range .015-.021, average .018 grams.
Substrates of the polysaccarides starch, glycogen, agar and inulin were
prepared in one per cent solutions. For cellobiose, turanose and maltose
60 micrograms were present in the test solution; with melibiose and
sucrose this amount was increased to 100 micrograms.
The enzyme extracts were prepared by homogenization in five
milliliters of buffer with subsequent centrifugation for fifteen minutes.
One ml. of supernatant was added to one ml. of substrate and eight ml.
of buffer. This reaction mixture, layered with toluene, was incubated
at room temperature. Deproteinization with sodium tungstate in dilute
HÃ¸so (Haden, 1923) was used to stop the reaction. The mixture was
sampled at 0, 4. 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours and reducing sugar determined
by the Somogyi method (Somogyi, 1952; Velson, 1944). Measurements
were made with a Klett-Summerson Photoelectric Colorimeter using a
standard curve from 10 to 100 micrograms specific to the reducing sugar
being tested. Controls of buffer and substrate and buffer and enzyme
were run simultaneously with the reaction mixture.
Since various sugars give differing amounts of color by the Somogvi
