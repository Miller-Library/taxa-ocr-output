In the field both Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata are
observed feeding by radular action on substrates containing a variety
of microscopic blue green and green algae. Macroscopic algae are
known to be a natural component of the diet of L. scutulata; L. planaxis
only feeds on the large marine algal types when starved under laboratory
conditions. In addition, large quantities of bacteria and detritus
are revealed on examination of stomach contents. Feeding does not
appear to be highly selective. Extracts of the gut of both species
could, therefore, be expected to contain a variety of carbohydrases
capable of splitting linkages in the structural and reserve polysaccarides
of the marine enviornment. The bacterial contribution to snail digestion
must also be considered.
The following survey is not a characterization of the carbohydrases
of the littorines, but rather an examination of the digestive potential-
ities of these snails. Although the pH of the littorine gut was not
determined experimentally, a value of 5-6 or 6.5-7.5 is reported for the
digestive tract of many marine molluscs. (Freter and Graham, 1962).
Initial tests on L. planaxis showed activity to be considerably greater
at 5.5 than 7.5; therefore, subsequent tests were run at the lower
value. It cannot be assumed that the pH optimum of a particular enzyme
is the level at which it is functioning in the intact animal. By test-
ing at a pH calculated to be that of the alimentary tract one can
qualitatively analyze the enzymes of ecological significance to the
test organism.
Procedure and Metho
Snails were collected daily and starved for a period of twelve
hours. This procedure allowed time for a reduction of both the algal
