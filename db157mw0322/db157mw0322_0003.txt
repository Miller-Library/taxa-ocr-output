INTRODUCTION
Fluid dynamics dictate that the smaller an object is and the slower it
moves the harder it is to move through a fluid. A dimensionless coeificient
called the Reynolds number (Re) quantitatively describes the effective
stickiness of the fluid -ie how difficult it is to push the fluid out of the
way
Re =ul/y
Uis the velocity of the fluid flowing by the object, 1 is some characteristic
length, andvis the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (Vogel, 1980). The
Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial to viscous forces of a fluid
moving steadily past some object. For low velocity and small size, the
viscosity dominates and a low Reynolds number results, the opposite is true
for larger objects and objects traveling at high velocity
These properties present interesting problems for marine organisms
Medusae are particularly interesting in that, unlike many other organisms
that have various developmental stages with different methods of
locomotion, they maintain the same general shape and use the same method
of locomotion, even though they may undergo volume changes of four or
more orders of magnitude over their life. The subject of this study, Eutenin=
Igeans has typical volumes of less than 1 mm3 for the young and on the
order of 1 to 22103 mm3 for adulte. The adults have an inherent locomotive
advantage simply because their size allows them to operate at much higher
Reynolds numbers. The objective of this study is twofold: first to look at
general locomotion in the juveniles and aduits and see how and wy they
differ; second to look at the specific forces affecting a swimming medusa and
