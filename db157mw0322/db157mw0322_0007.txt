Note that G depends on volume rather than area, as for drag. Alpha is the
added mass coefficient -a term which reflects the effect of shape on the
acceleration of the surrounding fluid. It can be estimated by instantaneous
bell height, h, and radius, r:
a/h)l
(7)
Prolate (cigar-shaped) shapes have lower than do oblate (Mal) shaped
objects. Du/dt is the acceleration of the animal relative to the surrounding
fluid
Inertia is closely related to acceleration reaction, in fact G can pe
viewed as the effective inertia of the surrounding fluid. The sum of the
accel√©ration reaction and inertia is the total force required to accelerate the
animal in the absence of drag:
F= (1)V du/dt
(8)
As opposed to drag, which always resists the motion of objects, these forces
resist changes in velocity
RESULTS
The distance vs time data shows that adults always maintain forward
motion while the young fall back between phases(figs 3&4). The velocity of
the adult and of the young both oscillate in the expected manner -reaching
maximum relative velocities durng the contraction phases. The adult data
show a net increase in velocity over the three cycles. The young accelerate
rapidly to a peak and then decelerate and actually attain a small negative
velocity between contractions. There is no accumulation of velocity as with
the aduits (fig 5). The drag coefficient for the adults is very stable in the
range of 0-1. For the young, Ca changes dramatically, often reaching values
o1 50 to 100. Negative values simply mean that the animal was moving in
the opposite direction(fig. 6).
