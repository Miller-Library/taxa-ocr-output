ABSTRACT
The properties of fluid dynamics present interesting problems for
marine lise, dictating that the socomotion of slow moving animals are
controlled by the viscous forces in their environment. This study looked at
medu
an locomotion in adult and young Eutonina indicans. Medusae, unlike
many other emall marine organieme, maintain the same relative shape and
method of locomotion as their size spans 44 orders of magnitude during thei
growth phase. It was found that the locomotion oi the young medusae
dominated by drag These juvenie accelerate rapidy to overcome the
viscous forces inhibiting their motion, but decelerate just as rapidiy as thrust
tapers off. Medusae swim by a jet propulsion mechanism, in which they
produce thrust by ejecting fluid backwards. The aduits contract and
accelerate slower, but move more efficiently and further than the voung due
to their larger size. Over a similar time span and number of swimming
cycles the young onsy managed to move 1/3 the relative distance of the
adulte
