the young only move about 1.2 bodylengths and the adults move about 3
(fig. 23).
DISCUSSION
The continuous increase in the adult velocity reflects the reduced drag
effects the animals experience. The reduced drag is a result of two factors;
the lower Reynolds number at which the adults exist because of their size
and the fact that their greater mass allows them to maintain some forward
inertia during the expansion phase The young, on the other hand, due to
their smaller size and much larger drag coefficient, are dominated by drag
They have very littie inertia to carry them forward, and stop all forward
motion within a third of a second of the end of the contraction phase. In
terms of energetics, these conditions greatiy favor the adults. Energy
expenditure translates into acceleration due to the dependence of
acceleration on velocity change. Since the adult animals maintain some
forward velocity from prior contractions they can accelerate slower as they
approach some target velocity. In other words, adults can use a series of
contractions with smaller accelerations to gather speed. The advantage in
thie is that they donâ€™t need large accelerations which would produce large
inetilforces acting against them. The young, however, face each
contraction with the same situation -to propel forward from a net negative
velocity. The jellyfish does a number of things to try to deal with this
situation:
Firstly the young accelerate themselves with a thrust force that peaks
four times sooner than the adust's and gives them four time greater
acceleration(figs. 13814). They accomplish this by throwing back 3 times
more of their total volume through an opening that closes to a relative size
1/3 times smaser that of the adult in 1/4 of the time.
