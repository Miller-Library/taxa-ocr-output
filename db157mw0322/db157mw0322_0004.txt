compare the strategies adopted by individuals of each size in dealing with
their respective situations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1 collected data by video recording captive medusae and then
performing a frame by frame analysis on the recorded information. Adults
were recorded in a display tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. These
animale were o-weeks old, and were the largest available specimens.
According to aquarist Freya Sommer, animals in the wild get much larger
due to their more varied diet. Because of their emaller size, recording the
juveniles which were less than 4 days of age, required the preparation of a
special tank Iconstructed a tant that was only 3/4 trom front to pack to
try to keep the animals in focus. The tank was lit irom above. The pack of
the tank was blackened and the front covered with polarizing film. All
animals were at 13°0.
The the first step in the analysis consisted of deciding which animals
of each size would be the subjects of the study. I watched the filmed
spécimens several times and also observed live animals to determine vnat !
will refer to as a typical jellyfish of each size -one that had no physical
abnormalities, and showed no aberrant swimming behavior. Once I found
appropriate specimens I traced the animal from a video monitor for each
trame three consecutive swim cycles. A swim cycle consists of a contraction
and an expansion. I traced each sequence 3 times as a means of estimating
tracing and measurement error. I also traced the distance the anterior
margin of the medusa traveled in each frame. The VCR records 30 frames
pe second soeach frame l traced represented 1/30 s. The spatial scaling
trom monitor to real life was 2:1 for aduits and 13:1 for the young
