m√©an radius and a height measurement of each slice, calculated the volume
of each slice, and then added the slices. The calculation of dV/dt was a
simple matter of taking a derivative of the volume with respect to time. For
simplicity of comparison volume, velar aperture, and the subsequent
measurements of projected surface area and the radius to height ratio were
graphed in the following way -since each animal was filmed for a sequence
of three cycles the three contraction phases were plotted together and the
three expansion phases were plotted together. Linear regressions were then
performed on each parameter for each size, so that rates of change could be
easily illustrated for young and adult.
Drag D, force always resists motion of the animal and is dependent on
the shape and speed of the animal.
D=C4005 S u?

Cais the drag coefficient, a dimensionless term which is estimated by the
equation (Daniel 1982)
Ca = 24/Ren
Re is the Reynolds number, the power n'is 1.0 for Recl and 7 for 1eRe6500.
Figure 2 shows Re versus time for both specimens, and they both fall in this
range.
S in Eq. 4 is the projected surface area (PSA) in the direction of motion
and uisthe instantaneous velocity of the animal with respect to ite
surroundings. I measured the PSA by taking a maximum radius of the
medusa and calculating area as for velar aperture. The instantanequs
velocity was calculated as described earlier.
The acceleration reaction(Eq. 1), like drag, is a shape-dependent force:
G =V du/dt
