The four fold time difference is a common theme in the time course of
all the time varying factors between young and adult, it reflects the
advantage the adults have in their low drag and larger mass. They can
afford to do things slower to avoid the negative influences of inertia and the
acceleration reaction, and thereby spend less energy swimming.
The dramatic changes the young undergo in shape and velocity
during contraction have several important consequences. The rapid
acceleration allows them to achieve their maximum forward velocity quickly,
First and most importantly this increases the Reynolds number at which the
ansmals are functioning assowing them to overcome the viscous forces of
drag. Unfortunately, velocity is a two edged sword, while increased velocity
inceases Re and lowers Ca drag itself is proportional to the square of the
velocity. As speed grows, so does the drag force which begins to dominate as
thrust tapers off. This seems contradictory, in that as speed increases the
drag situation becomes better and worse at the same time. The clarification
lies in the magnitude of the components that affect drag. Caand PSA both
decrease in time over the contraction phase, while velocity increases, so it
comes down to a question of dominance. Cq varies roughly lineariy with
velocity whereas overall drag varies with velocity squared,
The overall greater added mass coefficient of the adults (fig 19) is not
that great a burden to them due to the fact that they need not accelerate
that rapidly to increase their velocity -they combat inertial forces by using
small accelerations. The much lower, values for the young are crucial to
them as they must accelerate rapidly to try to get the most out of each
thrust.
Figures 22a;23 sum up the overall situation of the young medusae as
compared to the adu√Æt animals. Despite their ability to accelerate to much
