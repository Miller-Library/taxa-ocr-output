lused the distance data to construct plots of distance ys time. From
these data I casculated the velocity by taking a running average of the slope
of the distance data for any three points the slope at the middle one was
calulated by averaging the slopes of the lines to the points on either side
The forces involved in medusan locomotion can be summarized by the
following equation:

17
THRUSI - DRAG + ACCELERATION RXN + INERTIA (1)
Each of these forces can be broken down into simple physical parameters
which can be easily measured from the type of frame by frame analysis
described above (Daniel 1982).
Thrust T, the propulsive force in a jet locomotion system, is dependent
on the rate of momentum efflux from the animal(figure 1):
T - u. (dm/dt)
(2)
where u. is the velocity of the ejected fluid relative to the animal and
dm/dt is the rate at which mass is ejected from the medusa. Stated in other
terms thrust depends on the magnitude of the volume change, the rate of
volume change, and the size of the opening through which the fluid leaves,
For medusae this opening called the velar aperture(fig. 1). Equation 2 can be
rewritten as
T=/Ay)(dV/dt)2
(3)
in which is the density of seawater, 1025 kg/m3 Ay is the velar aperture,
and dV/dt is the rate of volume change. Velar aperture and the rate of
volume change are both potentially time varying. Velar aperture was
determined by taking diameter measurements from the video record, then
calculating the area by assuming the aperture to be circular. Volume
calculations were made by hand integration -l.e. I divided each tracing into
horizontal slices each of which reasonably approximated a cylinder, took a
