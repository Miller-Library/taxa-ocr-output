Aduits onsy change their volume by twenty percent during contraction
as opposed to the seventy to eighty percent change in the young(fig. 7) The
young animals reach minimum volume in about 1/4 the time of the adults
and reexpand in 1/4 to 1/5 the time(figs 8 &9).
The differences in the change in velar aperture between juveniles and
adults are not as dramatic as those for volume. Adults undergo a 608
reduction as opposed to the young animal's 808 reduction(fig. 10). Once
again the time course for contraction and expansion in the young is about
1/4 that for the adult(figs. 1 1& 12). The absolute numbers for the thrust
calculations are not important as the calculations were made from linear
approximations of dV/dt and Ay In fact, these values actually taper as the
end of a contraction approaches, but the relative time course and the relative
accel√©rations are significant. Once again we see a factor of four difierence in
time course and also a maximum acceleration attained by the juveniles 4x
greater than that of the adult(figs. 138 14).
The young change their projected surface area by eighty percent
during contraction while the adults change by only 258 (fig 15). The
fourfold difference in time is evident once again (figs. 168p; 17). The drag
force resembles the velocity data in time and relative magnitude, it peaks
when velocity peaks and the difference between the maximum and
minimum values is the same. This indicates that velocity is the governing
parameter influencing drag (fig. 18). The adult added mass coefficient is
always greater than that of the young, while the two fluctuate by the same
amount (figs. 19,20&a;2 1).
The adult velocity (in bodylengths/s) is constant relative to the
immense fluctuation in the young (fig. 22). Over the course of three cycles
