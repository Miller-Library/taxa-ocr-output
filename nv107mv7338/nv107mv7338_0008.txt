results, but replication of data makes this explanation unlikely.
Our limited one-day chemical analysis of the outfall area shous
the significant daily fluctuations of physical parameters prevalent
at Stations 1 & 2. These fluctuations, no doubt, influence the numbers
and types of bacteria and diatoms that can tolerate this environment.
The stations established at Pt. Pinos will be left throughout the
summer months in an attempt to study the long term effects of the outÂ¬
fall on invertebrate larvae.
Acknouledgements
I would like to thank Doug Muchmore and Craig Blencoue for their
kind help and muscle power in establishing my stations at Pt. Pinos.
I would also like to exprass my appreciation to Dr. Epel of Hopkins
Marine Station for his help and counsel throughout this project.
