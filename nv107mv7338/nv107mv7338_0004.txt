An overall one month picture of early settlement was obtained by
this method.
Collected plates were transported in individual containers kept
in fresh seawater in a styrofoam bucket. Plates were examined imm-
ediately uhen possible. Studies on STS-1 & 2 concentrated on enum¬
eration of bacteria. Studies on plates collected on day 4 & 5 con-
centrated on counting andidentification of diatoms, and any other
microscopic organisms found on the plates. The recovered slides used
for bacterial investigation were allowed to air dry, after which time
bacteria were heat fixed. The standard Gram stain was employed as
a means of seperating gram-negative and gram-positive species.
A Zeiss light microscope with phase objectives and occular magnifier
uas used throughout the investigation. The area of a standard cover¬
slip (484mm), was traced on the backs of collected plates and bac-
teria wera counted at 2000x, by observing 10 random fields within this
area. Diatoms were counted at 200x along the diagonals of quadrants
traced on the backs of slides as shn in the pattern below. (Fig. 3).

Slime scrapings were taken from the wooden slide holders and
from rocks adjacent to Stations 4 & 5. (see Fig. 1-x).
A cursory one day chemical analysis was carried out on May 22
using standard seawater analysis methods, (Strickland and Parsons, 1968).
Station 5 was "lost at sea" on May 25, consequently, there are
minor gaps in some graphs and tables.
Results
The results of this study will be described in three parts, the
first presenting bacterial trends and the second presenting diatom
and other microscopic form data. The third phase of this study provides
physical data for the Point Pinos area.
Bacteria-
After many hours of preliminary observation of various morphologic
types eight definite morphologic forms were chosen as test 'species".
The forms and pertinent information are given below in Fig. 4.
