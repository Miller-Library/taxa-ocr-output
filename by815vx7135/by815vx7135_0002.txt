Abstract
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) begin reacting to visual stimuli barely after hatching; by seven days,
their saccade reflex (quickly flicking the head and eyes towards a stimulus) is fully developed.
Therefore, the brain region responsible for these activities - the optic tectum - must undergo
enormous transformation within this time period. In order to observe the morphology of this
transformation, I examined 3-day old, 5-day old, and 7-day old larvae, accessing a variety of
techniques. Specifically, I looked at: stained serial sections of whole fish using a conventional light
microscope; confocal images of whole and dissected fish after injection with lipophilic FM 1-43FX dye;
and scanning electron microscope images of FM 1-43FX-injected fish, which were produced on a
recently-invented, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscope. Qualitative analysis reveals that
structural change in the tectum is subtle but apparent, with cells proliferating most rapidly along the
bilateral axis of the tectal lobes, and along the outermost tips of the distal ventricular branches.
