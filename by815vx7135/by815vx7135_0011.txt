Figure 1. In-plane comparison of cell proliferation and migration between 3-day and 7-day fish.
Figure 1a. Three days after hatching, the cell bodies are evenly spread along the ventricular zone of tectum
with a slight outward flare at both edges of each lobe
Figure 1b. Seven days after hatching, the difference in cell volume between the proximal and distal sides of
each lobe is pronounced, with a much greater increase in cell volume along the bilateral axis. In addition, the
flare" of cells on either side of each lobe is larger, especially along the distal edges.
