It is assumed that the two very large circles are cell bodies, that the stringy masses below them are processes,
and that the oblong grey-and-black "pills" - such as the one just to the left of the cell bodies - are
mitochondria. Further research, however, must be done to establish the location and appearance of synapses,
and the exact connectivity behind them.
