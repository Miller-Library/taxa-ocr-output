DISCUSSION
From table 2, one can see that the major variables, PAR, In(integrated
chlorophyll, and In(surface chlorophyll+ surface phaeopigments), explain
comparable amounts of variance throughout the table. This observation, along with
the significance levels, implies that the MBARI data set may be representative even
at the smaller sample size.
A thorough analysis of the regression models yields far more information
than the regression equations. With large sample sizes and r* values over 0.60, the
first three regression models include PAR, a measure of daylength and available
light levels, and pigment concentrations. These appear in each model as the most
significant variables. Because the amount of available light can be a limiting factor
in production, the inclusion of PAR as a major variable in all the models is
understandable. Chlorophyll measurements, which are also significant in every
model, are a measure of biomass via the chlorophyll pigments present in all
photosynthesizing organisms. Clearly, a correlation between production and
phytoplankton biomass is expected. Not only are both PAR and pigments the most
significant variables in these models, they are also measurable by satellites.
Although phaeopigments are only associated with chlorophyll molecules and
do not play a role in photosynthesis, both molecules have almost the same
absorption spectrum and thus a satellite senses the sum of both pigments(Smith
and Baker, 1982). To create For an equation comprised of variables measurable by
satellite, this combined term is useful. Further, model 2, with surface chlorophyll
plus phaeopigments and PAR, explains 9% more variance than model 1 which uses
only surface chlorophyll.
Model 3, using integrated chlorophyll, yields a slightly higher r2 than either
model 2 or model 1. Photosynthesizing phytoplankton are distributed throughout
the euphotic zone; because integrated chlorophyll measurements provide a value
