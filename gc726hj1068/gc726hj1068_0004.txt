MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data set used for this analysis was collected by the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute(MBARI) in Monterey Bay from 5 April 1989 to 2
May 1990. The data set, part of an ongoing project at MBARI, includes 31 single¬
day cruises, with 109 stations. MBARI had four stations per cruise where primary
productivity measurements were taken consistently: two offshore and two oceanic
stations. (see figure 1)
To determine which biological factors play a role in explaining the variance
between primary productivity and surface chlorophyll in the Monterey Bay system,
the analysis includes ten variables and seven groups of phytoplankton. The
variables used are not necessarily measurable by current satellite technology.
Temperature and salinity measurements were taken on a Seabird CTD
system at several depths. For this analysis, only the surface temperature and salinity
levels were used. To give an estimate of the mixed layer depth, the change in
temperature between 0-40 meters is also included as a variable.
Water samples for the productivity measurements taken at depths which
were shown, by a secchi disk reading and calculation, to receive 100, 50, 30, 15, 5, 1,
and 0.1% of the light. Those depths throughout the euphotic zone were sampled by
collecting water in Niskin bottles, putting the samples into polycarbonate bottles,
adding a known amount of 1C, and incubating the bottles on deck in mesh
cylinders that allowed only the prescribed percent light for that depth. Äfter 24
hours, the amount of carbon uptake was measured by the radioactive tracer,1C.
Using trapezoidal integration, production was calculated for the entire euphotic
zone. This integrated carbon measurement value, measured in mg C/m2/day is
used in this analysis as the value for primary productivity.
Water samples for the chlorophyll and nutrient levels were also collected in
Niskin bottles at several depths throughout the euphotic zone. The chlorophyll
