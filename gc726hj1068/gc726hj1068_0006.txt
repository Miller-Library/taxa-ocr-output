irradiance data, measured in watts/m2/day. I use this to generate the regression
equation:
watts= -5.12 +0.47'PAR
Using this equation and solar irradiance data from MBA, PAR levels for those four
days are calculated.
The phytoplankton for the group analysis variables were collected in Niskin
bottles at those stations where productivity measurements were taken. The
organisms were counted by taxonomic group, classified according to shape and size,
and run through an algorithm to calculate the actual ugC/liter/group. The groups
included separate classifications for the following: picoplankton, ultraplankton,
nanoplankton, heterotrophs, centric diatoms, pennate diatoms, both centric and
pennate diatoms, and all groups as a single variable.
A correlation matrix with all the variables is used to identify those variables
which correlate well with primary production. Stepwise multiple regressions on
several models determine which variables explain the most variance in primary
production. Because both carbon and chlorophyll measurements follow a log-
normal distribution, these variables are used in the regression after a logarithmic
transformation (Campbell, 1987). I test the most significant models by comparing
the observed primary production from another regional data set with the expected
production generated by the regression equations. The data set used in this test
was collected by MBARI in Monterey Bay and the waters of the adjacent California
Current following the same methods described above. Figure 2 shows the stations
used in this second data set. PAR data collected by MBA was also used in this
second data set.
