Table Legend
Table 1. Correlation coefficients mentioned in the text. Primary productivity, which is
the integrated carbon value, is abbreviated "pp". The significance levels and the
sample size are also given.
Table 2. Lists the ten multiple regression model discussed. Only the independent
variables are shown. Integrated carbon is the dependent variable in each model. The
partial re indicates how much variance is explained by each variable and the model r
shows a cumulative total, with an asterisk denoting the total r2. The r* values can also
be read as percentages of the variance in primary productivity explained.
