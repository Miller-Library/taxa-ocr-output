INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, there has been increased interest in estimating
primary production from satellite imagery. On a global scale, primary productivity
and other oceanic processes have a very significant effect on the entire carbon cycle
(Barber, 1990); our understanding of the entire carbon cycle would improve by
quantifying global production. On a regional scale, estimates of primary
productivity would be useful because phytoplankton crops are often patchy and can
have large spatial and temporal variability. Current estimates of primary production
over regional areas are generated from measurements taken by sampling at a few
stations and extrapolating for the larger unknown area. Thus, estimates of primary
production using satellite data could increase the accuracy of assessing the total
productivity of on a larger scale.
Two kinds of satellites would be used to collect the data for the estimates
the Coastal Zone Color Scanner(CZCS), which measures surface pigments, and the
Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer(AVHRR), which senses sea surface
temperature. Although satellite imagery provides some relevant data and appears
to be a feasible method for remotely sensing primary productivity, the current
technology does not provide methods for measuring all the biologically important
variables that affect the rate of carbon uptake. For example, satellites can provide
data on surface pigment levels, but much of the chlorophyll, representing the
photosynthesizing phytoplankton, is below the surface and distributed throughout
the euphotic zone. Ã–ther biological factors that help determine the amount of
primary productivity include nutrient levels and species composition of the
phytoplankton crop, neither of which can be measured using existing satellite
technology.
Despite the difficulties in using satellites, other data sets have been
examined and equations have been created that can explain some of the variance
