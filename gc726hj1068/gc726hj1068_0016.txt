Figure Legend
Figure 1. A map of Monterey Bay showing the distribution of stations used by MBARI
in the first data set. Data from these stations is used to create the regression equations.
Figure 2. A map showing the distribution of stations used by MBARI in the second data
set. Data from these stations is used to test the equations created by the multiple
regression techniques. An 'X" shows stations included in the test data set. An "O"
shows those stations where additional data is available, yet not included in this study.
Figure 3. Plot of observed versus expected primary productivity.. Observed values are
from the second MBARI data set and the expected values are generated using the
model 2 regression equation,
int carbon= 5.72 + 0.00029'PAR + 0.33'In(surface chl + surface phaeo)
The correlation coefficient, r=0.54 is significant at the 1% level.
Figure 4. Plot of observed versus expected primary productivity. Observed values are
from the second MBARI data set and the expected values are generated using the
model 4 regression equation,
int carbon= 3.54 + 0.00024*PAR + 0.65*In (int chl) + ).063'surface phaeo
The correlation coefficient, r=0.77, is significant at the 1% level.
Figure 5. Plot of primary production in Monterey Bay and the composite variable, PAR
multiplied by integrated chlorophyll. The numbers in parentheses by certain data
points, indicate the Julian day on which the data was collected and the station at which
the measurements were made. Only the data from summer cruises at stations HI and
CI are labelled.
Figure 6. Plot of primary production in Monterey Bay and the composite variable, PAR
multiplied by integrated chlorophyll. The labelled points shown in figure 5 are edited
out, increasing the correlation coefficient from 0.81 to 0.83. For clarity, a logarithmic
scale is used to spread out the clustered points and to show the relationship more
clearly.
