between production and surface chlorophyll levels. These equations have
explained up to 60% of the variance in primary production. Eppley et al. (1985), for
example, was able to explain 58% of the variance in the Southern California Bight
after regressing production against daylength, pier temperature anomaly(a measure
of interannual ocean temperature variability), and pigments.
This study attempts to report whether a significant amount of the variance
in Monterey Bay primary production can be explained by analyzing the Monterey
Bay Aquarium Research Institute data set using multiple regression techniques. In
the hopes of learning more about the Monterey Bay ecosystem, selection of the
variables was not constrained by satellite measurement capabilities, but rather by
the data that was available.
