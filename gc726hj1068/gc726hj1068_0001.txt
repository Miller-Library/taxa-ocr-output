ABSTRACT
Using data collected by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute(MBARI) in
Monterey Bay and employing stepwise multiple regression techniques, this study
develops several equations that estimate primary productivity for Monterey Bay.
The most significant equation, using integrated chlorophyll, photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR), and surface phaeopigments as variables, explains 77% of
the variance in primary productivity measurements. Another equation explains
70% of the variance, using the two variables, PAR and surface chlorophyll +
surface phaeopigments, which are both measurable by remote sensing. Tests of
these equations on another MBARI data set, which includes oceanic sampling,
demonstrates the possible applicability of these equations on a regional scale.
