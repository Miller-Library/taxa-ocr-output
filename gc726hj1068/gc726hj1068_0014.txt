Another advantage of these models, developed using only Monterey Bay
data, is that they generate reasonable estimates of primary production in the nearby
ocean area as well. The larger area an equation represents, the more useful it will
be when applied to satellite data. Figure 4 shows how well the model 4 equation,
when applied to the second MBARI data set, calculates expected primary
production. Increasing the data set and incorporating wind data may improve these
models even further. Even without these improvements, estimating primary
productivity in Monterey Bay appears possible.
Acknowledgements- I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Francisco Chavez, for his
helpfulness and patience, and everyone else at MBARI who contributed
programming time, answers to silly questions, and general moral support to me and
my project throughout the quarter.
