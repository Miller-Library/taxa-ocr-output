In addition to explaining large amounts of the variance, model 2 and model
4 also incorporate variables that are available in the second MBARI data set. To
test the applicability of these models, I compare observed primary production from
the second data set with expected primary productivity measurements generated by
model 2. This yields an r=0.54, significant at the 1% level(see figure 3). Using the
model 4 regression equation, the correlation between observed and expected
increases to r= 0.77, pÂ«0.01 (see figure 4).
