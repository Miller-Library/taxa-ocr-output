RESULTS
The correlation matrices indicate which variables correlate well with
primary productivity (see table 1: all correlation coefficients mentioned are in this
table). All of the well-correlated variables, however, cannot be used in the same
model because some of them represent the same variance of primary production.
For example, surface chlorophyll and integrated chlorophyll correlate well with
each other; if used in the same model, the variance of primary production they
explain would overlap and one could incorrectly conclude that one of the variables
was not important.
Delta temperature, a variable with a relatively high r when correlated with
primary production, is a significant variable in this system. Because of incomplete
temperature data on several cruises, data points for delta temperature do not span
the entire data set. To maintain the largest possible sample size, delta temperature,
along with other variables with small sample sizes are not entered all the models.
Even though these variables are important, a larger sample size increases the
significance of the models To allow for the missing data, I analyze several multiple
regression models, all shown in table 2.
Ten models are presented in table 2. Of the ten, Model 10, which includes
In(surface chlorophyll+ surface phaeopigments), PAR, nanoplankton, and pennate
diatoms as the significant independent variables, explains the highest amount of
variance, with rÂ°= 0.875. Although this regression is significant at the 0.0001 level,
the small n'of the plankton group data may make this model less reliable. Model 5,
with an r== 0.772, explains about 10% less of the variance than model 9, yet has a
much larger sample size(n= 94). Note that model 2, using only PAR and In
(surface chlorophyll + surface phaeopigments), still explains over 70% of the
variance and, more importantly, both variables are obtainable directly from a
satellite data set.
