30 s, and 72’C for 1 min; final extension of 2 min at 72°C, and then left at 14’C) to get my PCR
product (Braby and Somero, 2006a). Then, 0.2 ul Hhal enzyme, 1.5 ul 1Ox buffer, and 0.15 ul
bovine serum albumin (100 ug ml") were added to 15 ul PCR amplicon, and digested for 4
hours at 37°
PCR products for both loci were visualized using gel electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel, stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain. For the Glu-5 locus, I added 5 ul PCR amplicon
into each well, and for the ITS locus after digestion, I added 15 ul digest solution with 3 ul
Blue/Orange 6x loading dye to each ladder. Glu-5 was run at 150V for 45 min, while the I7S
digest was run at 120V for 50 min. To arrive at the final genotype designation, individuals were
scored at each locus separately, and then compared: if either locus indicated a hybrid, then that
individual was classified as a hybrid.
I selected individuals within a 30-50 mm shell length range, to attempt to minimize size
as a variable in enzyme activity. Äfter doing this, my sample size was reduced to 9 M.
galloprovincialis, 13 hybrids, and 12 M. trossulus individuals.
MDH enzyme assay
The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme assay cocktail contained 50 ml of 0.20 M
imidazole/Cl buffer, 0.0054 g of NADH (final concentration of O.15 mM) and 0.0014 g
oxaloacetate (final concentration of 0.2 mM). The assay cocktail was prepared fresh each day
and stored on ice in a conical plastic tube covered by foil.
To conduct the MDH assay, cuvettes were filled with 2.00 ml of assay cocktail and
placed in a 20'C water bath for at least 5 min. Next, the spectrophotometer was calibrated using
a cuvette with 2.00 ml of assay buffer, 0.20 M imidazole/Cl buffer. The spectrophotometer was
