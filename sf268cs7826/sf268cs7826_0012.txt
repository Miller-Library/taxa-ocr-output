However, when the relationship between shell length and enzymatic activity for each
enzyme was compared for individual species, different results occurred. The P-values for the
regressions of MDH activities versus body length for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M.
trossulus were 0.10, 0.14, and 0.77, respectively, with r’ values of 0.3347, 0.1835, and 0.009,
respectively. Thus, none of the single-genotype regressions for MDH was significant (Fig. 4).
The P-values for CS of M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M. trossulus were 0.62, 0.08, and 0.01,
respectively, with r’ values of 0.0363, 0.2460, and 0.5024, respectively. Thus, in only one case,
CS for M. trossulus was a significant relationship between enzymatic activity and size observed
(Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION:
This study found significant differences among the Mytilus congeners and their hybrids in
enzymatic activities in the posterior adductor muscle. Most prominent was the difference
between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. The higher enzymatic activity in M. trossulus
relative to M. galloprovincialis is consistent with the former species being better adapted to low
temperatures. Thus, relative to M. galloprovincialis, M. trossulus would be better able to
maintain ATP production at low temperatures. This possibly would confer a competitive
advantage on M. trossulus at lower temperatures.
The fact that the hybrids exhibit an intermediate enzyme activity level is also notable.
The hybrids are not able to span the entire coastline as the parental species do, but are instead
confined to a narrow range of temperatures, where their parental species currently coexist.
