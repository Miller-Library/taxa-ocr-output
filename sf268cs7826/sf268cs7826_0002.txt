congener being more cold-adapted (able to sustain a high metabolic rate at low temperatures)
than the Mediterranean invasive. Furthermore, the hybrids are adapted to both warm and cold
water, and can survive in a middle climate range. These data correlate to the mapped
distributions of the genotypes along the California coast and to the previous knowledge of the
physiological differences between the species.
