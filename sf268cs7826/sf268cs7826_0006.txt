immediately put on dry ice and brought back to Hopkins Marine Station, where they were stored
at -80’C until used for experimentation.
Preparation of the tissues
For the enzyme assays, only the adductor muscle was used, as it provided abundant tissue
for homogenate preparation. For genotyping, the foot was used. The mussels were removed
from the freezer, put on an iced dissection tray, measured (height, length, and width), and then
cut open. The two tissues were scraped free from contamination with other tissues, and then cut
out. The tissues were put in foil on ice, and the foot was placed back in the freezer for later
genotyping. The adductor muscle was used immediately to produce tissue homogenates for the
enzyme assays.
In preparation of the tissue homogenates, the adductor muscle samples were weighed,
and then placed back into the foil on ice. Using the masses, I determined the amount of
homogenization buffer (5OmM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8) needed to produce a 10-fold
diluted homogenate for each sample. If the total volume of homogenization buffer was under 0.5
ml, however, a 20-fold dilution of the tissue was used.
The appropriate volume of chilled buffer was put in a homogenizer. The tissue sample
was first minced with a sterilized scalpel, and then added to the homogenizer. The pestle was
then inserted and the sample was homogenized for several minutes, until the suspension was
sufficiently homogenous.
Next, the homogenate was transferred into a 2 ml microfuge tube and centrifuged for 5
min at 14,000 rpm at 4’C. The supernatant was then pipetted off and placed in a new microfuge
tube, which was kept on ice until it was used for the enzyme assays.
