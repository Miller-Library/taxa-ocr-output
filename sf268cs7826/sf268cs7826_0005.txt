trossulus had a significantly lower temperature at which heat-shock proteins were synthesized,
and these data, too, are consistent with M. trossulus being a more cold-adapted species.
More recently, research has been conducted on the enzyme biochemistry of the two
species. Both Fields et al. (2006) and an acclimation study by Lockwood (unpublished) show
higher enzyme activities in M. trossulus. This suggests that they are more cold-adapted than M.
galloprovincialis because they are able to maintain normal enzymatic function even at low
temperatures. While results of these laboratory acclimation studies agree with previous research
and conclusions, data obtained from in-lab acclimation studies may not necessarily resemble data
obtained from the field.
This uncertainty is what prompted the overall question for my study: Do enzymatic
activity rates in field-acclimatized M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis from a common habitat
exhibit the same type of variation found in laboratory acclimation experiments? Because these
two species are able to hybridize, I also examined hybrids to determine how their enzymatic
activities compared with those of the pure species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of specimens
Blue mussel specimens were obtained from an intertidal beach located on the outer
region of Bodega Bay, CA (38°19’28"N, 123°2'19"W). Bodega Bay was selected as the
collection point due to a 2006 survey that revealed a fairly equal abundance of M. trossulus and
M. galloprovincialis and the presence of hybrids (Braby and Somero, 2006a). Specimens were
collected during a midday low tide on April 16, 2008. Samples were obtained from crevices in
rocks and from mud burrows. A wide size range of specimens was collected. The mussels were
