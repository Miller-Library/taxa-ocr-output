INTRODUCTION:
Coastal marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to introduced, invasive species which
can compete with native species. This is due to the constant movement of water and organisms
between habitats, ranging far along the coastline, as well as the high rates of translocation -
frequently due to the ballast water of ocean vessels (Fields et al., 2006). This constant travel of
ocean vessels allows repeated opportunities for colonization; many times, the introduced species
is able to successfully compete with the native species in the area. There are many reasons why
some introduced organisms have the ability to successfully compete with native species
(Dahlhoff, 2004). Here, we explore pre-existing physiological suitability as the cause for
successful invasion, through temperature adaptations. The mechanism of invasive success was
examined through comparing enzyme activities of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate
synthase (CS) from two mussel congeners and their hybrids. The mussels studied were Mytilus
trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis.
Both Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis are part of the ’blue mussel’
complex, which, along with Mytilus edulis, comprises three quarters of the Mytilus genus. The
four congeners of the Mytilus genus are the three blue mussels, and one ribbed mussel, Mytilus
californianus (McDonald and Koehn, 1988). The three blue mussels are morphologically
similar, and the species cannot be distinguished without genetic analysis.
Before 1988, it was thought that the only Mytilus mussels that were present on the west
coast of North America were M. edulis and M. californianus (Braby and Somero, 2006b).
However, it was then determined in 1988 that there in fact was no M. edulis and instead there
were M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis, and M. californianus. This discovery was made through
allozyme analysis and then later confirmed with mitochondrial DNA haplotyping (McDonald
