enzyme activities show the same trend as those measured in laboratory-acclimated specimens.
For MDH, the differences in specific activity may be largely the result of intrinsic differences in
catalytic efficiency (Fields et al. 2006).
Lastly, there are many opportunities in this field for research on the hybrids. This study
didnâ€™t look at generational hybrids, but instead only if a specimen was a hybrid or not. Hybrids
currently are limited to their narrow, intermediate temperature range, but there is a possibility
that with more back-crossed hybrids being formed, their temperature adaptation range may
change. Research looking more at the differences in hybrid adaptation could also reveal if they
will play a larger role in this competitive interaction in the future.
CONCLUSION:
Overall, this study yielded valuable information regarding the competitive interaction
between the native Mytilus trossulus, the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis, and their hybrids.
This study indicates that M. trossulus is more cold adapted, M. galloprovincialis is warm
adapted, and that their hybrids may be adapted for intermediate temperatures. This correlates to
previous research looking at the physiological differences between these species, and also relates
to the current distribution maps of the species along the coast of California. Lastly, this study
confirms the findings made with laboratory-acclimated blue mussels by showing that laboratory-
acclimated and field-acclimatized specimens exhibit the same genotypic-specific differences.
This study provides insights into the role of temperature in governing the spread of the invasive
species, M. galloprovincialis, northwards along the Pacific Coast. The future of this invasion
may depend on rising temperatures, but more research on other factors like salinity that are
