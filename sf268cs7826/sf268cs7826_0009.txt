set for 60 sec running time, and a 340 nm wavelength. Then, I put a cuvette (with assay cocktail)
in the spectrophotometer's cell holder, and let it reach thermal equilibrium for 2 min. Then,
using a glass micro-pipette, 25 ul of homogenate was added into the cuvette and briskly stirred to
distribute the enzyme evenly. The lid was closed, the recorder was activated, and the enzyme
output was visualized on the screen.
Using the computer software, a slope of the line was calculated, to show the change in
absorbance per min. The slope was calculated from where the line initially became linear. Two
replicates were run unless the difference between them exceeded 5%, in which case a third
replicate was run. Replicates were averaged to obtain a single activity value for the specimen.
CS enzyme assay
The CS cocktail contained 25.5 ml of assay buffer (50 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 8.2 at
20°C), 3.0 ml of 15 mM MgCl, 8 mg of DTNB (dissolved in 10 ml of assay buffer before being
added to the cocktail) and 3 mg of acetyl CoA. The tube containing the cocktail was wrapped in
foil and stored on ice.
53 mg of the substrate oxaloacetate were dissolved in 10 ml of assay buffer and stored on
ice in a foil-wrapped tube.
To conduct the CS assay, cuvettes were prepared with 2.00 ml of assay cocktail and
placed in a 20'C water bath for at least 5 min. The spectrophotometer was calibrated using a
cuvette with 2.00 ml of assay buffer, 50 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 8.2 at 20’C. The
spectrophotometer was set for a 400 second running time, and a 412 nm wavelength. Then, I put
a cuvette in the spectrophotometer’s cell holder, and let it reach thermal equilibrium for 2 min.
Then, using a glass micro-pipette, 25 ul of homogenate were added into the cuvette, and briskly
