FIGURE LEGEND
Fig. 1. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity presented in international units per gram fresh
weight (I.U./gfw). Average enzyme activities are shown for each species, and error bars are
standard errors of the mean (n = 9 for M. galloprovincialis, n = 13 for hybrid, and n = 12 for M.
trossulus). Bars with different letters are significantly different.
Fig. 2. Citrate synthase (CS) activities (I.U./gfw). Average enzyme activities are shown for each
species, and error bars are standard errors of the mean (n = 9 for M. galloprovincialis, n = 13 for
hybrid, and n = 12 for M. trossulus). Bars with different letters are significantly different.
Fig. 3. Comparison between enzyme activity (I.U./gfw) and shell length (mm) for all
individuals. MDH activities are shown in A, and CS activities are shown in B, both with trendÂ¬
lines included.
Fig. 4. Comparison between MDH activity (I.U./gfw) and shell length (mm) for individual
species. M. galloprovincialis is shown in A, hybrids are shown in B, and M. trossulus is shown
in C, all with trend-lines included.
Fig. 5. Comparison between CS activity (I.U./gfw) and shell length (mm) for individual species.
M. galloprovincialis is shown in A, hybrids are shown in B, and M. trossulus is shown in C, all
with trend-lines included.
