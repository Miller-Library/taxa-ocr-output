Genotyping
The procedure used for determining the genotype of each specimen followed the protocol
of Braby and Somero (2006a). First, DNA was isolated using membrane spin columns
(Macherey-Nagel, Nucleospin^ DNA extraction kit). Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
methods were used with 1 ul of template DNA, to amplify two nuclear loci. Both Glu-5, a
byssal thread protein locus, and ITS, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region were used,
as each species has a different sized fragment at each of these loci.
At the Glu-5 locus, M. galloprovincialis has a fragment size of 300 bp, while M.
trossulus has a fragment size of 240 bp. A hybrid between these species contains both
fragments. I used the published primers, slightly modified PCR chemistry (25 ul reaction
volume with 16.40 ul H2O, 2.5 ul Coral Load Buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1.25 ul each of
10 uM primer 1 (FWR) and 10 uM primer 2 (REV), 2.5 ul dNTP mix (mM), 0.1 ul Taq
polymerase, and 1.0 ul template DNA), and slightly modified cycling conditions (initial
denaturation of 1.5 min at 94°C; 25 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 53°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s;
final extension of 2 min at 72'C, and then left at 14'C) to get my PCR product (Braby and
Somero, 2006a).
The ITS locus amplifies a-950 bp sized fragment for both species, but after a restriction
digest using Hhal restriction enzyme, M. galloprovincialis has a fragment length of 450 bp,
while M. trossulus has a fragment length of 280 bp; the hybrid exhibits both fragments. Tused
the published primers, slightly modified PCR chemistry (50 ul reaction volume with 33.8 ul
H2O, 5.0 ul 1Ox buffer, 2.5 ul each of 10 uM primer 1 (FWR) and 10 uM primer 2 (REV), 5 ul
dNTP mix (mM), 0.2 ul Taq polymerase, and 1.0 ul template DNA), and slightly modified
cycling conditions (initial denaturation of 1.5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for
