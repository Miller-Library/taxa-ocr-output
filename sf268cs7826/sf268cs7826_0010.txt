stirred to distribute the enzyme evenly. The background rate recorded in the absence of
oxaloacetate was visualized on the screen. Ã„fter 200 sec, 25 ul of oxaloacetate solution was
added into the cuvette, the solution briskly stirred and CS activity was recorded. The
background rate was subtracted from the oxaloacetate-dependent rate to get the final change in
absorbance per min that reflected CS activity.
Two replicates were run unless the difference between them exceeded 5%, in which case
a third replicate was run. Replicates were averaged to obtain a single activity value for the
specimen.
Data Analysis
Enzyme activity was calculated as change in absorbance per min, and then converted into
International Units/gram fresh weight (I.U./gfw) by using this equation: I. U./gfw -
(AAbsorbance/min x a conversion factor based on the molar extinction coefficient) - g tissue
added to cuvette. With these data, I averaged the trials for each individual and then performed
one-way ANOVA to determine statistical significance between the different species for each
enzyme.
To determine if any size-dependence in enzymatic activity existed in the specimens, 1
plotted shell length against enzymatic activity. I did this two times for each enzyme, once with
all species combined on one graph, and then again with individual species for each enzyme. I
used linear regression analysis to look for significant trends in both cases.
