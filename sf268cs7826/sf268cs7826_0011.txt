RESULTS:
For both enzymes, the overall trend in activities was: M. trossulus 3 hybrids 3 M.
galloprovincialis (Figs. 1 and 2). The average MDH activities for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids,
and M. trossulus were 72.943.8 I.U./gfw, 95.347.5 I.U./gfw, and 104.347.4 I.U./gfw,
respectively (Fig. 1). The ANOVA on MDH enzyme activity indicated significant differences
(P-value = 0.0165) among genotypes. However, not all differences between genotypes were
statistically significant. Using a Tukey post hoc test to determine which genotypes showed
statistical significance, it was shown that only M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus were
significantly different; the intermediate activities in hybrids did not differ from those of the
parental species.
The average CS activities for M. galloprovincialis, hybrids, and M. trossulus were
1.08+0.13 I.U./gfw, 2.18-0.24 I.U./gfw, and 2.6340.19 I.U./gfw, respectively (Fig. 2).
The ANOVA test on CS activity indicated significant differences (P-value «0.0001). However,
similarly to MDH, not all genotypes were significantly different from each other. From the
Tukey post hoc test, it was shown that M. galloprovincialis was significantly different from M.
trossulus, as well as the hybrids. However, the hybrids were not significantly different from M.
trossulus.
When comparing shell length to enzyme activities using linear regression, a significant
trend was shown for each enzyme when all the species were combined onto one graph.
Activities of MDH and CS versus body size had r’ values of 0.2347 and 0.3850, and P-values of
0.0037 and « 0.0001, respectively. Thus, when all specimens of all genotypes were analyzed
together, a significant negative correlation between size and enzymatic activity was found (Fig.
3).
