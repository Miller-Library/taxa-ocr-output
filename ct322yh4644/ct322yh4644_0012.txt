Table 4. Analysis of variance of the means of biomass of granite and sandstone in the protected site. The
p-value in the "Rock" row indicates the probability that the difference in biomass between rocks
was due to statistical error. The p-value in the "Type of Biomass" row indicates the probability
that the difference in biomass between the types of biomass was due to statistical error. The p-
value =0.000 in the "Rock"Type" row indicates that the difference in biomass between rocks
depended on which type of biomass was analyzed.
