ABSTRACT
The utility of fractal geometry as a descriptive tool in the natural sciences has increased as more and
more naturally occurring fractal patterns have emerged. Fractals have been used to describe the shape of
plants, the length of coastlines and
the porous nature of rocks. This study focuses on determining if three rock types--granite, basalt and
sandstone-in the Monterey Bay region have a fractal nature and if so, how that nature may affect the
standing biomass.
Basalt was found to have a higher fractal dimension than either granite or sandstone on the scale of
10 cm. On the scale of 1 m, both granite and sandstone have a higher fractal dimension than that measured
on the 10 cm scale. In the protected site, plant biomass on granite was significantly greater than that on
sandstone. There was no correlation between the fractal dimension of substratum and the animal, plant or
total biomass. Fractal dimension did not, in this case, prove to be a useful technique for describing substrata
in the rocky intertidal zone.
