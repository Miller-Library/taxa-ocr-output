Table 1. Analysis of variance of the means of fractal dimensions of basalt, granite and sandstone on the 10
cm scale. The p-value =O.019 in the upper table indicates the probability that the difference in
fractal dimesnion among the rocks was due to statistical error. A p-value Â«O.O5 indicates a
significant rock effect.
