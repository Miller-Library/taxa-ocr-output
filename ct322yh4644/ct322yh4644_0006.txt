There was no significant difference in biomass between the rock types in the exposed site. Howeyer.
again there was a significant difference between the mean plant and animal biomasses. Plants were more
abundant then animals
At the exposed site, basalt was dominated by Mastocarpus and Cthamalus with a substantial amount
of Pelvetia and gooseneck barnacles. The biomass of granite was mostly Mastocarpus, Cthamalus and various
limpets.
No correlation was found between the fractal dimension of the substrate and the weight of the
animal, plant or total biomass present.
DISCUSSION
The significant difference between basalt and sandstone on the 10 cm scale and the ranges of fractal
dimension for each rock on the 10 cm scale (see fig. 1) and on the 1 m scale (see fig. 1) show trends
(granite has the highest range of fractal dimension, basalt falls in the middle and sandstone has the lowest
range) that suggest an overall range of fractal dimension for a rock type. How useful this tool may be is not
certain because none of the trends in this study were significant
lwo aspects of this study may be affecting the lack of a statistically significant patteren in the data
regarding fractal dimension: Ismall sample size and 2)only one rock formation for each rock type. The
trends found at the three outcroppings in this experiment-sandstone at Stillwater Cove in Pebble Beach,
granite at Hopkins Marine Reserve and at Carmel Point and basalt at Carmel Point--may or may not be
reflective of the total range of fractal dimension for each rock type. It would be enlightening to make more
measurements at these sites as well as at other formations to establish if there is a definitive range of fractal
dimension for either of these three rock types. Further study should also include more rock types; ones that
are commonly found as substrata in the rocky intertidal and other ecosystems and even ones that do not
serve as substrate at all.
