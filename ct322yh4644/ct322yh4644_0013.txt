Table 5. Analysis of variance between means of biomass of granite and basalt in the exposed site.
The P-value in the "Rock" row indicates the probability that the difference in biomass between
rocks is due to statistical error. The p-value in the "Type of Biomass" row indicates the
probability that the difference in biomass between the types of biomass depends on statistical
error. The p-value =O.460 indicates that there was not a siginificant interaction effect.
