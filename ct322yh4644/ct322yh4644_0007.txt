The other result that suggests that fractal dimension could possibly be useful for describing an
ecosystem's physical environment is that there is a higher fractal dimension at the larger scale measured.
The lower fractal dimension at the smaller scale suggests that fractal dimension may approach one as the
scale length decreases. The next step would be to take more measurements at both larger and smaller scales
to develop Ã  complete picture how fractal dimension changes with scale for one rock type.
The extremely high amount of plant biomass on the granite in the protected area as compared to
that on the sandstone is unexplained by fractal dimension as there was no correlation between biomass and
fractal dimension. Further study should focus on why there is a greater abundance of Mastocarpus on granite
as it contributed greatly to the overall weight of plant biomass on granite and was not present on sandstone.
There may also be a correlation between fractal dimension and some other aspect of plant type such as
holdfast size or size of the total plant.
It is probable that other aspects of the substrate could be the cause of differences in biomass,
Hardness of rock, rate of erosion and porosity may all have an effect. For instance, it may be more difficult
for a plant to establish itself on sandstone because of the rock's softness and fast rate of erosion. The higher
porosity of sandstone may allow better water retention and thus have effect on the water available to the
plants and on the temperature of the microhabitat.
