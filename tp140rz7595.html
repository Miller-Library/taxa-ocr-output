Of the 21 species found in the cores, 7 are not native to Elkhorn Slough. Average
number of native individuals per core was approximately the same in F. enigmaticus
(21.6) and O. lurida (19.5) but F. engimaticus harbored, on average, 4 times more
invasive individuals than O. lurida. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and analysis of
similarity showed significant dissimilarity (P =.006) in the invasive assemblage between
microhabitats but no significant dissimilarity among sites (P = 083). The same analysis
showed significant dissimilarity among sites (P=.001) and no significant dissimilarity (I
—.253) between microhabitats in the native community structure. Dissimilarity between
microhabitat types was shown to be driven primarily by the abundances of four invasive

Introduction
Biological invasions represent one of the most challenging, and fastest growing,
environmental problems faced today. The spread of non-native species is responsible for
§138 billion annually in recovery and management costs in the U.S. alone (EPA 2003).
Invasive species threaten ecosystems through their rapid spread, competition with native
species, consumption of limited resources, and often severe alteration of habitat (Byers
2000, Vitousek and Walker 1989, Crooks 1996, Grosholz et al. 2000, Stachowicz 2001).
Like many other habitats, the aquatic ecosystems of central California, including
Monterey Bay are threatened by biological invasions. In recent years, Monterey Bay and
its associated ecosystems have seen the introduction of many non-native species with
potential for great impact including <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Undaria pinnatifida : Exact'>Undaria pinnatifida</span> in Monterey Harbor, and the
invasive tubeworm, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, in Elkhorn Slough.
Elkhorn Slough is a coastal wetland located due east of Moss Landing, California
in the center of Monterey Bay. It contains the second largest area of estuarine habitat in
California, comprising dunes, marsh, oak woodlands, maritime chaparral, and mudflats,
but generally lacking significant amounts of native aquatic hard substrates (ESNERR
website 2003). Freshwater is supplied primarily near the mouth of the slough by the
Salinas River channel and from runoff from nearby agricultural lands, so the upper
slough tends to experience high salinity (Wasson et al. 2001). Its ecological significance,
physical characteristics, and species composition have been thoroughly investigated
(Wasson et al. 2001; Carlton 1979). Approximately 500 native marine invertebrates are
known from Elkhorn Slough (Caffrey et al. in Wasson et al. 2001); Wasson et al. (2001)
documented the presence of 56 exotic species.
Ficopomatus enigmaticus is an invasive reef-building tubeworm that originated in
Australia and was first discovered on the West Coast of the U.S. in the 1920's (Carlton
1979). This cosmopolitan organism can be found in abundances up to 80,000
individuals m (Bianchi et al. 1995) in reefs that grow to 20 m* and occupy up to 80% of
the available hard substrate (Schwindt and Iribarne 2000). F. enigmaticus was
discovered in Elkhorn Slough in 1994 and nine years later, it has spread throughout the
slough, greatly increasing the amount of hard substrate available in the system (Wasson
et al. 2001). It is likely a successful invader because it possesses traits that are different
from most of Elkhorn Slough's native species. Davis et al. (2000) argued that this was a
necessary factor in the success of an invader because native species are expected to
already occupy all niches.
Simberloff and Von Holle (1999) proposed an invasional meltdown hypothesis
whereby a group of exotic species interact with each other in ways that facilitate and
mutually improve the success of each other's invasions. This results in greater overall
success and increased impact of the invasive species. Facilitative interactions such as this
are at “least as common as detrimental ones" (Simberloff and Von Holle 1999). Many
invasive species possess a life history dependent at least in part on the use of hard
substrates and/or interstitial spaces (Wasson et al. 2001), which <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>F. enigmaticus may</span>
provide. Furthermore, the majority of animals found on non-biogenic hard substrate in
Elkhorn Slough are invasive (Heiman pers. comm.). The introduction of large amounts
of hard, three-dimensional microhabitat may have significant positive effects on the
abundance, spread, and impact of other invasive species within Elkhorn Slough. Because
of the characteristic mudflat environment in Elkhor Slough, F. enigmaticus may
facilitate interactions with species that utilize complex hard substrate in the slough
Invasive species may be much better suited to exploit F. enigmaticus reefs than the
majority of natives that are mostly adapted to soft sediment environments. Furthermore,
F. enigmaticus may actually increase the number of non-native species establishing in
Elkhorn Slough by creating microhabitat that invasive species are better adapted to utilize
than native infaunal species.
The native microhabitats most analogous to the invasive reefs of F. enigmaticus
are aggregations of the oyster <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ostrea lurida : Exact'>Ostrea lurida,</span> which occur sporadically throughout
Elkhor Slough. The infaunal assemblages within reefs of F. enigmaticus reefs are
significantly different from assemblages living outside of the reefs in the soft sediment
(Heiman unpubl. data). However, it is not known whether the same, predominantly
invasive, assemblage that is found in F. enigmaticus reefs structure is present in other
hard biogenic hard substrate such as O. lurida.
To evaluate the impacts of F. enigmaticus on native community structure, the
present study examined differences between assemblages found living in the biogenic
microhabitats of F. enigmaticus and O. lurida. This comparison will be vital in
determining whether F. enigmaticus is altering community structure by increasing the
distribution and impact of invasive species. The results may be utilized in conjunction
with other work to aid in the management of F. enigmaticus in Elkhorn Slough.
Methods and Materials
-Collection and Processing
The study was performed in Elkhorn Slough from April to May 2003. Three sites
were involved: one each where only F. enigmaticus (Hudson Landing (HL)) or O. lurida
(Bat Ray Lagoon (BRL)) were present, and one with both species present (Kirby Park
Railroad Bridge (KPRR)). The three study sites were all in the upper Slough where F.
enigmaticus occurs at the most sites (Fig. 1). Criteria for collection were to obtain equal
numbers of samples, to collect nearly complete vertical profiles of the microhabitats, and
to sample sites with significant populations of O. lurida or F. enigmaticus.
At HL and for the O. lurida samples at KPRR, 3 cores were chosen from each
reef. A standard starting point of reference and a random numbers table that gave us three
numbers (x, y, z) were utilized to decide what location in the reef to core (x feet in, y steps
to the left [z even) or right [z odd). For the F. enigmaticus samples at KPRR and O.
lurida samples at BRL, no extensive reefs are present, and so entire isolated clumps of
each were taken, using two random numbers (x, y) to decide where to sample (x steps to
the north Ly odd) or south sy even).
Once locations of cores were decided, a 10 cm diameter auger was used to isolate
a core down to the primary substrate. This method was only used for the F. enigmaticus
samples at HL, all other samples were taken using a 10 cm diameter coffee can and a
spade to dig them out. At all sites except the KPRR F. enigmaticus samples, the cores
were also split into top and bottom halves. The KPRR F. enigmaticus samples didn't
penetrate deep enough into the substrate to be divided. For the samples using the auger
(HL F. enigmaticus), depth of the core was measured while still in the auger and each
half was then processed separately. At all other locations, "top" was considered the
entire part of the sample that was erect and standing above the mud while "bottom" was
everything down to the primary hard substrate.
Each half of the cores or clumps was then placed in a 500 um sieve and washed in
situ to remove mud and clay. Samples were then placed in plastic bags and stored in a
cooler. Samples were processed further upon return to Hopkins Marine Station.
Clove oil was added to samples to relax the organisms and minimize breakage
during processing. After twenty minutes exposure to clove oil, samples were transferred
to one liter glass jars and filled with a ten percent formalin solution for fixing. After
three days in formalin, samples were rinsed and transferred to ethyl alcohol. Organisms
were stained with Rose Bengal added to the ethanol to facilitate sorting. Once transferred
to ethanol, samples were ready to be sorted.
For sorting, samples were first purged of their ethanol and washed in freshwater
through a 500 um sieve. Washing removed any remaining mud and flushed any
interstitial invertebrates out of the crevices and interstices. Larger pieces of oyster shell
or F. enigmaticus tubes were removed once rinsed and saved later weighing. Once
samples were washed, the sieve was gently placed in a still water bath which allowed
amphipods to float to the surface where they were skimmed off and counted. The
remaining portion of each sample was systematically examined under a dissecting
microscope at 9x power (some identification was done at higher power, up to 55x) and all
individuals except F. enigmaticus and O. lurida were identified, counted and removed.
Identification was done using Smith and Carlton (1975), Morris, Abbot, and Haderlie
(1980), Fauchald (1977), Hartman (1968), Light (1978), and an Elkhorn Slough infaunal
photographic key prepared by K. Heiman (pers. comm.). Unidentifiable amphipods were
identified by Peter Slattery at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Moss Landing, CA.
and Freya Sommer at Hopkins Marine Station identified <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Runcina macfarlandi : Exact'>Runcina macfarlandi.</span>
Once a sample was sorted, the ethanol was discarded and the reef fragments were
placed in the fume hood to dry. Dried samples were then weighed with the previously
removed larger segments and their volume measured by water displacement.
Because F. enigmaticus samples were characteristically heavier and more
voluminous than O. lurida samples, the raw counts were standardized by mass and
volume. The standardization factors were determined by taking the lowest mass among
the samples and dividing the mass of each sample by it. Each species' abundance in a
sample was then divided by this number to obtain a standardized data set. This method
was repeated for volume.
-Analysis
The site-by-species matrix of abundances was analyzed using PRIMERS
(Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research, Plymouth Marine Laboratory,
United Kingdom). Separate comparisons were performed on the invasive and native
components of the samples for both sites and microhabitats. This allowed for a
meaningful comparison of the invasive assemblage in relation to the native assemblage
species with in the two biogenic microhabitats.
Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was performed on the Bray-Curtis
similarity matrices calculated among both sites and microhabitat (F. engimaticus vs. O.
lurida). MDS uses the similarity values in the Bray-Curtis to plot relative distances
between samples on a dimensionless grid. It begins randomly with one value that relates
two samples, plots them as a function of their similarity, and continues through the entire
matrix so that distances between all samples on the plot are proportional to their
similarity in the Bray-Curtis.
In addition to MDS, a second element of Primers, the ANOSIM test, was used to
measure the similarity between samples according to site and microhabitat. ANÖSIM
uses the Bray-Curtis matrix and compares the similarities of samples within groups with
those among groups. It then returns an r value from 0 to 1, with 1 denoting that all
replicates within groups are more similar to each other than any replicates from other
groups. AP-value is also returned indicating the significance of the results.
Finally, the SIMPER test was used to determine which species contributed most
to differences among sites and among microhabitats.
A more detailed discussion of MDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER, and the rest of
PRIMER is available in Clarke and Warwick (1994).
Results
Species composition and abundance varied significantly both among sites and
among microhabitats (F. enigmaticus vs. O. lurida) (Table 1, Appendix 1). Of the 21
species found in the samples, 7 are invasive. Approximately 11 times as many
individuals (334.1 vs. 30.56) were found in the top of the cores than in the bottoms.
Because there were so few animals in the bottoms of the cores, the bottoms were pooled
with the tops to give total abundance per core. The pooled data were used for the rest of
the analysis.
An MDS plot of all species (Fig. 2) shows that there are differences in the
assemblages associated with the two microhabitats and among sites. ANÖSIM found
significant dissimilarities among sites (P =.001) and between microhabitat (P =.041).
Standardizing by volume or weight yields the same results: there are significant
differences in the assemblages among sites (P -.001 and .002) and between habitats (P -
041 and .026)
To investigate these results further, MDS (Figs. 3, 4) and ANOSIM (Table 3)
were performed on the invasive and native components of the samples separately. The
MDS plot of invasive species (Fig. 3) shows more overlap among sites (P =.08,
ANOSIM) and more consistent separation between microhabitats (P =.006, ANOSIM).
Thus, for the invasive assemblage, there are significant differences in structure between
microhabitats, but not among sites. The MDS plot of native species (Fig. 4) shows clear
grouping of sites (P =.001, ANOSIM), but not microhabitats (P=. 25, ANOSIM).
Comparisons of species abundance (standardized by weight) between
microhabitats show that F. enigmaticus harbors a greater abundance and proportion of
invasive species per gram of sample than O. lurida (Fig. 5). However, the two
microhabitats have approximately the same abundance of native species.
Differences between microhabitats are driven in part by a predominantly invasive
group of species (Table 4, Fig. 6). The seven invasive species account for 52.54% of the
difference between F. enigmaticus and O. lurida microhabitats.
Discussion
Ficopomatus enigmaticus creates biogenic microhabitat that houses an
assemblage significantly different than that housed within the microhabitat created by O.
lurida. The community differences are found only in the invasive component of the
assemblage, however. Invasive species are found in greater abundance and in a higher
percentage within F. enigmaticus than in O. lurida while native species are distributed
evenly among the two habitats.
Different sites in the estuary have clearly distinguishable assemblages of native
species, probably due to heterogeneity of regions in the slough. The species that are
driving these differences are two native crabs, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hemigrapsis oregonensis : Exact'>Hemigrapsis oregonensis</span> and
<span style='background-color:grey' title='Pachygrapsus crassipes : Fuzzy'>Pachygrapsis crassipes,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cirratulus cirratus : Exact'>Cirratulus cirratus,</span> a native polychaete. <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>C. cirratus</span> was
found only at KPRR while <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>H. oregonensis</span> was never found at BRL, and only rarely at
KPRR, while <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. crassipes</span> was found at both BRL and KPRR in similar abundances, but
never at HL. Öther species such as the two <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Boccardia : Exact'>Boccardia</span> sp. and <span style='background-color:grey' title='Phoxichilidium femoratum : Fuzzy'>Phoxichilidium femoratus</span>
contributed less to the differences.
Due to the distribution of these species, and possible artifacts of the analysis.
these differences were inadvertently driven mostly by the presence/absence of species,
which is not a good indicator of community structure because it ignores other species that
are distributed between all sites in significantly different abundances. Because native
organisms seem to be distributed differently at different sites throughout the slough, it
may be the case that the distribution of native organisms is dominated by site
characteristics other than the microhabitats in which they are found. The physical
differences between these sites are not apparent, though they may be related to
disturbance regimes at the sites, distance from the mouth of the slough, or flow dynamics.
The invasive assemblage shows the opposite pattern found for the native
assemblage. There is significant dissimilarity in the invasive assemblage only between
microhabitats, but no significant dissimilarity among sites. Invasive species are wide¬
spread throughout Elkhorn Slough, but occur with F. enigmaticus to a greater degree than
with O. lurida.
Reefs of F. enigmaticus around the world host assemblages similar to the one
represented by invasive species in Elkhorn Slough. The two invasive species <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>(M.
insidiosum</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>M. nitida)</span> responsible for a large portion of the differences (29%
between these two microhabitats are seen in the same habitat in England, Argentina, and
Italy. Thomas and Thorp (1994) also found <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Streblospio : Exact'>Streblospio</span> sp., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tubificoides : Exact'>Tubificoides</span> sp., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polydora : Exact'>Polydora</span>
sp., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Eteone : Exact'>Eteone</span> sp., and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Capitella : Exact'>Capitella</span> sp. in F. enigmaticus reefs in England while Schwindt and
Irirbarne (1998) found <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Heteromastus : Exact'>Heteromastus</span> sp., Polydora sp., and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>B. hamata</span> in Argentina.
At the genus level, all of the invasive species found in this study were found in
other studies of interstitial assemblages associated with F. enigmaticus around the world
except <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Grandidierella japonica : Exact'>Grandidierella japonica</span> (Bianchi et al. 1996; Thomas and Thorp 1994; Schwindt
et al. 1998, 2001). Two were found at the species level. Monocorophium insidiosum, the
invasive amphipod that dominates F. enigmaticus assemblages in Elkhorn Slough, is
responsible for the most (15.6%) difference between F. enigmaticus and O. lurida
assemblages. It is a native of the east coast of North America, but has also established
itself as a prominent global invader of estuarine systems. (Bianchi et al. 1996; Thomas
and Thorp 1994; Schwindt et al. 1998, 2001). The amphipod is part of the interstitial
community of F. enigmaticus in England (Thomas and Thorp 1994), Argentina
(Schwindt and Irirbarne 1998), Italy (Bianchi et al. 1996), and San Francisco Bay
(Carlton 1979). The other invasive species from Elkhorn Slough found elsewhere was
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Boccardia hamata : Exact'>Boccardia hamata</span> in Argentina (Schwindt and Irirbarne 1998)
F. enigmaticus microhabitat comprises a very dense grouping of individual tubes
creating complex, branching interstices that eventually fill with mud and sediment.
Compared to the more open interstices of O. lurida microhabitat, those of F. enigmaticus
are much smaller, narrower and more abundant. This fundamental difference may be the
reason that this group of invasive species appears in such a great abundance in the reefs
of F. enigmaticus. Further investigation is needed.
Schwindt and Iribarne (2000) showed that F. enigmaticus changes the community
structure in a soft sediment lagoon in Argentina by providing habitat for the carnivorous
crab <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyrtograpsus angulatus : Exact'>Cyrtograpsus angulatus.</span> These crabs then changed the abundance and species
distribution of soft sediment species through predation. Future work could investigate
similar effects of trophic interactions on the community within F. enigmaticus
microhabitat. By providing habitat for carnivorous or omnivorous animals such as
Pachygrapsis crassipes or any of a number of errant polychaetes, F. enigmaticus could
be indirectly changing the community structure in Elkhorn Slough. A driving factor of
the community structure in F. enigmaticus may be how certain species are interacting,
not which ones are present or absent. The characteristics of F. enigmaticus may be
important only in attracting a group of carnivorous species which subsequently shape the
infaunal community through ecological interactions.
Despite differences in the invasive assemblages within these two microhabitats,
no previously undocumented invasive species were found within F. enigmaticus.
However, Wasson et al. (2001) showed that despite distance from the international port
of San Francisco Bay, great numbers of invasive species are capable of invading Elkhor
Slough. F. enigmaticus appears to provide suitable habitat for species that do well
globally in complex, hard substrate. It is therefore possible that F. enigmaticus could act
as an attractor for new invasive species that might not otherwise become established in
Elkhor Slough.

Conclusion
My results show that F. enigmaticus creates biogenic microhabitat that harbors a
significantly different assemblage of species than that found in the microhabitat created
by the native oyster O. lurida. These differences are due primarily to patterns among
invasive species; native species found in these two microhabitats are distributed similarly
However, there are significant differences in the native community among sites,
suggesting that native organisms have more localized patterns of distribution and
abundance that rely less on the nature of the substrate and more on undefined physical
characteristics of the sites. Invasive species occur more frequently with F. enigmaticus
over O. lurida. These patterns merit further detailed investigation.
