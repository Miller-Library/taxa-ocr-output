Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
INTRODUCTION
In the kelp beds off Mussel Point, Pacific Grove,
California, the chiton Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815)
is abundant on subtidal Lithophyllum encrusted rocks.
While colors and patterns make them inconspicuous on
a background of coralline algae, they appear vulnerable
to predation by nonvisual predators such as starfish.
Mauzey et al. (1968) state that, on occasion, the
sea stars Dermasterias imbricata (Grube, 1857),
Evasterias troschellii (Stimpson, 1862), and Orthasterias
koehleri (deLoriol,1897) eat subtidal individuals of
Tonicella in the Pacific Northwest. No published
information is available on predation of subtidal
Tonicella in Californian waters. I herein report on
laboratory experiments and subtidal observations
pertaining to the discrimination of nonvisual predators
against Tonicella and the possible reasons for the lack
of predation.
