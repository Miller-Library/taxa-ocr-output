Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
10

6. In determining whether the texture of Tonicella
valves alon√© is sufficient to repel starfish and other
predators, the valves of 5 Tonicella were epoxyed to the
backs of 5 Cyanoplax. These were placed in a tank with
5 normal Cyanoplax, i Pisaster brevispinus, 1 P. giganteus,
1 P. ochraceus, 1 Orthasterias koehleri, and 1 Patiria
miniata. Within 2 days, P. brevispinus had eaten 2
Cyanoplax with Tonicella valves, and Orthasterias koehleri
had eaten 2 with valves and 2 without. Thus, 4 of the 5
Cyanoplax with Tonicella valves were consumed. It appears
that for the Tonicella valves to be effective against
predation, the Tonicella must be alive.
DISCUSSION
Pisaster brevispinus appears to be the dominant
nonvisual, subtidal predator of Tonicella, and its
rate of predation is low. According to Nakashima (1974),
only .25% of the diet of P. brevispinus in the Mussel
