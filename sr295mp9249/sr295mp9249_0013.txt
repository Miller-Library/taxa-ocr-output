Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
Pacific Northwest could account for the difference in the
predation.
Explanations for the low predation on the Mussel Point
Tonicella, which appear to be easy prey, may include
difficulties encountered by starfish when removing
Tonicella from various substrates, lack of a chemical
attractant, possession of a chemical repellent, or
some form of a tactile inhibitor of predation. Cryptic
coloration, however, is not a possibility here as starfish
are not visual predators.
That both inverted Tonicella and Cyanoplax with
Tonicella plates attached to their backs were eaten
suggests that Tonicella's protection is dependent on
its being alive and upright. Thus, a living dorsal
surface may be the site of protection. Whatever the
protection, it is not 100% effective as indicated by
the 4 apparently healthy Tonicella that were eaten.
