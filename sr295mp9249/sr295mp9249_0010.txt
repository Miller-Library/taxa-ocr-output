Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
a chemical attractant.
4. As chemical properties alone do not appear to account
for the low rate of predation on Tonicella, the function
of the valves was more closely investigated. Four Tonicella
were inverted and affixed to glass slides using Devcon "Zip-
(oevee corp., Danvers Mass.)
Grip 10". They were placed in a tray with 1 Orthasterias
koehleri, 1 Pisaster brevispinus, and 1 P. ochraceus.
Within 3 days, 2 Tonicella were consumed, 1 by P. brevispinus
and 1 by P. ochraceus. It thus appears that inverted
Tonicella are very susceptible to predation by sea stars.
5. When Tonicella are not inverted, the valves are
the first part of the chiton that a predator comes in
contact with. Microscopically, the valves of Tonicella
appear smooth and shiny, unlike most other chitons. To
test whether or not a starfish's fube feet could hold onto
the smooth valves of a Tonicella, one was placed under
a starfish. When removal of the chiton was attempted, the
tube feet held on. Therefore, the protection seems due
to a nonmechanical property of the valves,
