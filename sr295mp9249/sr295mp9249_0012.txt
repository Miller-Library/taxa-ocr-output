Predation Upon Tonicella lineata

Point kelp bed is composed of Tonicella.
In the Pacific Northwest, Dermasterias, Evasterias,
and Orthasterias consume small amounts of Tonicella
(Mauzey et al., 1968). Additionally, Pisaster
ochraceus primarily eats chitons, including Tonicella,
during the winter when the starfish mass together in
groups and become rather sessile. The grazing movements
of the chitons bring them into contact with the starfish
(Mauzey, 1966). The diet of Leptasterias hexactis (Stimpson,1862)
has been reported to be composed of 45% Tonicella in
intertidal areas where there is little else to eat
(Mauzey et al., 1968). In contrast, local Tonicella
were not consummed by these starfish when in aquaria,
yet these starfish did consume other chitons.
The concept of 2 species, one intertidal and one
subtidal, has been advanced by Barnes (1972). Perhaps
a taxonomic distinction between the Tonicella collected
from Mussel Point and those studied by Mauzey in the
