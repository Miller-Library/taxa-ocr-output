Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
13
Stuart R. Seiff
SUMMARY
Starfish predation on Tonicella lineata in the
Pacific Northwest has been reported as common. However,
subtidal Tonicella from Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California,
are rarely consumed in aquaria by starfish which will
consume other species of chiton. A chemical repellent,
or some kind of tactile inhibitor of predation are
deemed possible explanations. The mechanism of the
protection of the local population from predation is not
known but appears to be associated with the dorsal surface
of living animals.
