In order to further investigate the lack of predation,
several laboratory experiments were performed. During the
course of study, a total of 92 Tonicella were exposed to
48 starfish in test aquaria. This resulted in 4,300
starfish hours of exposure during which time only
3 apparently healthy Tonicella were eaten. These were
all consumed by Pisaster brevispinus.
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857) ate
a Tonicella when the tank temperature rose above 14°0 as
a result of a running seawater system' malfunction. The
phenomenon of temperature affecting predation on Tonicella
is discussed by Barnes (1972, pp 17-18).
However, none of the following potential predators
consumed Tonicella in aquaria during at least 48 hours
exposure: the seastars Pisaster giganteus, Orthasterias
