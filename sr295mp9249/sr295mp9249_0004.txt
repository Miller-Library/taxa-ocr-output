Predation Ã¼pon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
METHODS AND RESULTS
Tonicella seem quite vulnerable to predation by non-
visual predators while situated on the Lithophyllum
covered rocks in the Mussel Point kelp bed. However,
their abundance implies that they are not heavily preyed
upon.
A 24 hour subtidal observation period was under-
taken to observe, in a natural setting, the activities of
subtidal Tonicella and associated fauna. The area
selected was a coralline encrusted rock in the Mussel
Point kelp bed measuring 1.2 x.6 x.25 meters. There
were 16 Tonicella present at the site, along with 2
Pisaster brevispinus (Stimpson, 1857), 1 P. giganteus
(Stimpson, 1857), 5 Patiria miniata (Brandt, 1835), and
1 Mitra idae (Melvill, 1893), Observations were made
every four hours. During this time no Tonicella were
consumed, though starfish were observed on top of the
