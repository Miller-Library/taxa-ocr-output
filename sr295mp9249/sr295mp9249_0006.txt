koehleri, and Leptasterias spp., and the carnivorous
gastropods Mitra idae and Conus californicus (Hinds, 1844).
During the various tests, starfish were often observed with
Tonicella beneath them. Thus, lack of contact between the
starfish and chitons was not a factor in the low predation
levels.
In more specific studies, 15 subtidal Tonicella, 15
Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847), and 15 Cyanoplax spp.,
all between 1.9 and 3.0 cm. in length, were allowed to
cm
attach to the bottom of a 43 x 27 x 25Aaquarium. The
potential nonvisual predators Pisaster ochraceus
(Brandt, 1835), P. giganteus, P. brevispinus, Patiria
miniata, and Orthasterias koehleri were introduced. The
seawater temperature was 14Â°0. The results, (Table 1),
after 3 days' exposure, show that no Tonicella were
eaten while the other chitons were. This differential
predation was significant using the chi square test (p(.01).
