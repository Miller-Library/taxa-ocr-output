Predation Upon Subtidal Tonicella lineata of
Mussel Point, California (Mollusca: Polyplacophora)

ABSTRAC.
There appears to be relatively little predation
upon subtidal Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point,
California, and there is significant discrimination
against feeding on them in the laboratory. A chemical
repellent, or some kind of tactile inhibitor of predation
are deemed possible explanations. The mechanism of the
protection against predation is not known, but appears
to be associated with the dorsal surface of living
animals.
