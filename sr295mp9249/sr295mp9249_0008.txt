Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
1. To determine whether contact between a starfish
and a Tonicella would produce a repellent in the form
of a pH change, the valves and feet of 5 Tonicella, not
exposed to starfish, were tested with pH paper. The
paper was placed on the wet back and foot of each chiton
and readings of 7.57.1 were obtained. After contact with
the starfish, Orthasterias koehleri, the pH readings of
both the valves and feet remained 7.5f.1. Thus, no
indication was found that an altered pH was the means by
which Tonicella avoid predation.
2. The presence of a chemical repellent within
Tonicella was tested for by use of a suspension of whole
ver hou-
Tonicella. ,Ywo live Tonicella (approximately 1.25-2 cm.)
everyheur
were ground upsusing a mortar and pestle.

The tissue and fluid were added to a tray containing
5 Cyanoplax spp. and the predators Pisaster brevispinus,
P. giganteus, P. ochraceus, and Orthasterias koehleri.
