Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
In order to be certain that the Tonicella in the
previous experiment were of the proper size for con¬
sumption by the starfish, 15 Tonicella, ranging in
size from 3.1 to 1.2 cm., were placed in another
aquarium with the same individual predators for 3 days.
None were eaten. These results indicate that starfish
preferentially consumed other chitons, and did not
eat Tonicella even when they were the only available
food source and a wide size range existed.
A series of laboratory experiments was conducted
to examine several possible reasons for this lack of
predation. All of the experiments were conducted either
in 43 x 27 x 25 cm. aquaria or 33x28 x13 cm. plastic
trays filled with running seawater at 14t1°0. The
number and size of Tonicella varied with the individual
experiment, as did the species, size and nuiber of the
predators.
