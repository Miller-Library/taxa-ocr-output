Predation Upon Tonicella lineata
Stuart R. Seiff
A control tray containing the same numbers of animals was
also set up, but no suspension of Tonicella was added.
In this experiment the running seawater was turned off
so as not to dilute the suspension. Fresh seawater was
added every hour with the new suspension. After 3 hours,
a Cyanoplax spp. was eaten by the Orthasterias koehleri
in the tray containing the Tonicella suspension. There
is thus no evidence for an active chemical repellent.
3. Cellulose sponge impregnated with suspension
of Cyanoplax spp. was attached to the backs of 5 Tonicella
in an attempt to determine if Cyanoplax possèss à chemical,
attractive to starfish, which Tonicella might lack. The
sponge was affixed using Devcon "Zip-Grip 10". The Tonicella
were placed in a tray with 1 Pisaster brevispinus, 1 P.
Ochraceus, and 1 Orthasterias koehleri. After 96 hours
of exposure, none of the Tonicella with the sponge were
eaten. It would thus seem that Cyanoplax does not have
