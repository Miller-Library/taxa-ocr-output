Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 4
removed from the rocks using a small spatula and placed in
containers of seawater for immediate transportation to a running
seawater table. Three clones were sampled to ensure genetic
variation. Two clones were from vertical rock faces, the third from a
horizontal surface. The animals were identified by threading tags
through the column signifying clone and treatment. Experimental
animals were kept in aerated seawater at ambient salinity (35 ppt)
and temperature (13.5Â°C) in a 12:12 (L:D)h photoperiod. The animals
were not fed during the experiment.
Experimental Treatment:
Baseline assessments of zooxanthellae populations were
obtained as described below. Seawater was diluted using deionized
water to achieve the experimental salinities of 10 ppt, 17 ppt, and 25
ppt as measured with a conductivity meter. Control salinity was 35
ppt. Two 2 liter containers were prepared for each salinity
treatment and the control. The containers rested in a water bath to
maintain ambient seawater temperatures throughout the stress, and
the containers were aerated with an aquarium bubbler. Evaporation
guards were placed over the containers to maintain the salinity
Three animals, one from each clone, were placed in each container,
The treatment period lasted four days. Salinity was monitored
throughout the treatment period. On Day 2 of the stress one
container of 17 ppt had an elevated salinity of 20 ppt for an
estimated period of 4 hours. It was adjusted. After the stress all
animals were returned to running seawater.
