Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 5
Tentacle samples were taken 0, 1, 7, 12, 16, and 20 days after
initiation of treatment. The samples were placed in filter sterilized
seawater (FSW), frozen at -20°C, and subsequently analyzed for
zooxanthellae content as described below. If the animals were
tightly closed magnesium chloride was used as a sedative to facilitate
sampling.
Estimation of Zooxanthellae populations:
To quantify the number of algae in the tissue, previously
frozen tentacle clips were thawed and homogenized in a 1.5 ml tube
with a micro pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes
at 5000 rpm in a microfuge to separate the algae from the animal
supernatant. The supernatant was removed and frozen at -20°C for
subsequent protein assays. The pellet was then resuspended in FSW,
vortexed and spun again at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The resulting
pellet was resuspended in a known volume of FSW. The
zooxanthellae were counted using a hemacytometer and protein
concentrations of the animal supernatant were determined
colorimetrically (Sedmark and Grossberg 1977). Algal cell numbers
were normalized to mg animal protein.
Data Analysis:
Data were analyzed using a 3 factor ANOVA with Salinity and
Time as orthogonal fixed factors and Containers nested within
Salinity and orthogonal to Time (Table 1).
