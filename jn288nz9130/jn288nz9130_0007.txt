Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima
There was very little change in color through the stress and
sampling periods. However, significant changes in algal populations
of experimental anemones were detected with cell counts. Control
animals had an average population of 3.8 X 106 cells/ mg protein.
Despite some variation, this number remained fairly constant
throughout the sampling regime.
A. elegantissima placed in 10 ppt salinity did not survive
longer than three days post-stress. During the initial three days, the
animals did exhibit some loss of algal cells. This treatment was
excluded from statistical analysis, since no data could be obtained
after Day 3.
Animals placed in 17 ppt and 25 ppt salinity showed a steady
decrease in cell number during the 20 day sampling period
compared to control animals, and both exhibited similar rates of
decline (Fig. 1). Algal counts declined more quickly in 25 ppt, but
significant differences between groups were not significant until Day
16. The populations in 17 ppt and 25 ppt decreased to an average
symbiont density of 1.5 x 10° cells/mg protein after 20 days post-
stress. The zooxanthellae populations in these treatments both were
significantly different from control populations by Day 16 and Day
20 (p««0.001).
There was also a significant difference between the 2
containers in the 17 ppt treatments (pe«0.001). This difference may
be explained by an increase in the salinity in one container for a 4
hour time period due to accidental removal of the splash guard. This
change in salinity in the container was detected and corrected, but it
may have caused the 2 containers to differ from each other.
