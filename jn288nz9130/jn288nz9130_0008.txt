Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 8
Epifluorescence microscopy:
Coelenteron contents collected from the animals in the 25 ppt
treatment and stained with fluorescein diacetate appeared as single
red spheres (Fig. 2A) due to autofluorescence of the algal chloroplast
with a green halo and green inside of the red spheres (Fig. 2B). The
presence of green stain indicated that these algae are viable. Product
stained with Hoescht again appeared as red spheres containing a
single blue nuclei within the cell (Fig. 20). Additional nuclei on the
outside of the cell were never detected suggesting that the released
products were single algal cells and not host cells containing algae.
Discussion
Bleaching, or the loss of algal symbionts, is not a phenomenon
unique to A. elegantissima. It occurs on a large scale in tropical coral
reefs due to various stresses. For example, corals are able to survive
at salinities 25-40 ppt. However, if salinity drops below 20 ppt for a
time period longer than 24 hrs it is lethal. One example of the fragile
nature of the coral-symbiont relationship is the bleachin
documented in Jamaica and Easter Island after decreases in salinity
(Goreau 1964, Egana and DiSalvo 1892). With global warming and
other environmental changes a large scale change in salinity is not
expected, however, there will be local changes in areas with
increased run-off patterns due to human land use, and changes in
weather patterns. Unlike corals, anemones are easily maintained in
the laboratory. Therefore, anemones are an excellent model for
