Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 3
documented in tropical cnidarians as a result of heat stress, no
investigations have been undertaken to determine the mechanism of
release due to other environmental stresses.
Anemones such as A. elegantissima have adapted to thrive in
harsh conditions. They are found on the West coast of North America
at varied vertical intertidal heights over a 2m range (Hand 1955).
The environment A. elegantissima inhabits subjects these animals to
many stresses. Included among these stresses is patchy, periodic
exposure to low salinity, occurring due to fresh water runoff during
rains and floods. Despite these disturbances, these anemones are
able to maintain a stable relationship with their algal symbionts.
Heavy rains in March caused flooding in the Carmel area.
Samples were taken to detect a possible bleaching event due to the
influx of fresh water. Experimental salinities were also tested in a
controlled laboratory environment in efforts to reproduce such an
event. The mechanism active in bleaching due to salinity stress was
investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Maintenance of the animals:
To investigate bleaching in the field, on April 19th tentacles
from animals were collected at Carmel Point and Carmel River. The
tentacles were frozen at -20Â°C. Carmel Point animals were used as a
control for the samples taken at Carmel River where heavy flooding
had occurred.
Experimental animals were collected in the mid intertidal from
Aggassiz beach at Hopkins Marine Station. The individuals were
