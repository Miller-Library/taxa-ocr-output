Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 10
The mechanism by which A. elegantissima releases its
symbiotic algae after salinity stress is not known. It has been shown
that algal cells are released in intact host cells under temperature
stress (Gates et al., 1992). Is this mechanism of release uniform
under all stresses, or is the animal reacting differently to different
stresses on a cellular level? The results presented here provide
evidence for the probable release of free algal cells. Under
epifluorescence microscopy the algal cells were viable and appeared
to be free of a host cell. Only the nucleus of the algal cell could be
detected. It is possible that host cells degraded prior to collection, or
that they were missed due to a gradual release. Baring experimental
or sampling error, however, there are 3 possible mechanisms for
release of free algae: exocytosis, apoptosis, or necrosis of the host cell.
Presently I have no evidence for which of the 3 is most likely
occurring.
Anemones are osmoconformers. They quickly equilibrate to
ambient salinities. Few species are naturally found in brackish water
[15-20 ppt.], normal sea water being at a salinity of 35 ppt.. The
coelenteron is ventilated facilitating the periodic flow of fresh sea
water into the coelenteric cavity. This mechanism causes the salinity
of the coelenteric fluid to reach that of the water in approx. 3-6
hours. Cells must regulate their volume so as not to burst and are
able to do so at a range of salinities (Shick 1991).
Cell volume regulation is achieved through the use of the
intercellular free amino acid (FAA) pool. As salinity decreases, the
free amino acid pool decreases. The pool size increases with
increases in salinity (Shick 1991). Recent work has shown that
