Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima
ABSTRACT
The cnidarian Anthopleura elegantissima is subject to a wide
variety of external stresses. The effects of decreased salinity were
examined in the field and in a laboratory environment. Animals
were experimentally subjected to decreased salinities of 10 ppt, 17
ppt, and 25 ppt over a period of 4 days. Laboratory results suggest
that salinity stress induces algal cell loss, however, cell loss was not
observed in the field. Mechanisms of release active in bleaching
under salinity stress appear to result in the release of free algae.
