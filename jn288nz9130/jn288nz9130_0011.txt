Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 11
animals and algal symbionts may communicate through the use of
amino acid signaling (Gates et al., 1992). With a decrease in the free
amino acid pool this signaling may be disrupted. The host may not
be stimulating the algae to return it's photoassimilates to the host.
The host may then consider the algae to be parasitic or too much of a
drain on the host's metabolism to be kept. Therefore, the expulsion
of the algae may bean indirect response to salinity stress indicated
through the process of cell osmoregulation. Further work is needed
to confirm this hypothesis.
