Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 6
Staining and epifluorescence microscopy:
In order to assess the state of algal cells released upon salinity
stress, released cells were collected, prepared, and viewed using
pifluorescence microscopy. Coelenteron contents released after
salinity stress at 25 ppt were collected by placing poly-L-lysine (1%
in distilled water) coated coverslips at the base of an animal in FSW,
The animal was agitated causing contraction of its oral disk and
expulsion of coelenteron contents. For 10 minutes the cells were
allowed to settle onto the coverslips. The coverslips were then
removed and treated with fluorescein diacetate, a vital stain showing
general cytoplasmic esterase activity (stock solution 15 mg/ml in
acetone; working solution 0.004 ml in 10 ml 0.1 M Tris buffer, 3%
sodium chloride, 0.004% calcium chloride, pH 7.4) according to the
methods of Gates et al., (1992). The coverslips were washed in the
Tris buffer, mounted on slides and viewed under epifluorescence
with an Olympus microscope. Additional coverslips were treated
with Hoescht 33258 which stains nuclei blue by binding to
chromatids (stock solution 5 mg/ml; working solution 0.004 ml in 10
ml 0.1 M Tris buffer, 3% sodium chloride, 0.004% calcium chloride,
pH 7.4) for 30 minutes. The coverslips were washed with the Tris
buffer, mounted, and viewed under epifluorescence The fluorescein
diacetate was viewed with a blue filter, wavelength 480 um, the
Hoescht used ultra violet light, wavelength 380 um.
