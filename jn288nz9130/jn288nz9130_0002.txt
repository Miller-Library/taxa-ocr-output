Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 9
A. Pisani
INTRODUCTION
Symbiotic relationships between photosynthetic unicellular
algae and cnidarians are common. The host supplies phosphorus and
nitrogen to the algae, as well as carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
In return, the symbiotic algae generally referred to as zooxanthellae
reduce nitrogen and supply the host with soluble photoassimilates
(Shick 1991). The algae are housed in membrane-bound vacuoles of
the endodermal cells in the tentacles and oral disc of the host givin,
a greenish-brown color to the animal. The sea anemone Anthopleura
elegantissima has such a relationship with the dinoflagellate
Symbiodinuim californium.
The symbiotic relationship between zooxanthellae and some
tropical cnidarian hosts has been shown to break down with various
environmental stresses including changes in water temperature
(Buchsbaum 1968, Steen and Muscatine 1987, Muscatine let al 1991).
intense levels of ultraviolet radiation in sunlight (Lesser and Shick
1989), and changes in salinity (Reimer 1971). The breakdown of the
association, referred to as bleaching, is accompanied by a reduction
in chlorophyll a within the algae (Szmant and Gassman 1990) or by
a loss of the algae themselves (Fisk and Done 1985). During
bleaching the host expels the algal symbiont by gathering the algae
in the coelenteron and egesting them upon contraction of its body
wall. There are five possible mechanisms of algal cell release in
bleaching: a) exocytosis; b) apoptosis; c) necrosis; d) pinching off of
the host cell containing the symbiont: and e) host cell detachment
(Gates et al. 1992). Although host cell detachment has been
