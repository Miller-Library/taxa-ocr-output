Salinity Stress in A. elegantissima 9
studying bleaching.
Understanding the effects of different
environmental stresses, such as decrease in ambient salinity, on
symbiotic relationships will help in the development of hypotheses
about future global change and its consequences.
Anthopleura elegantissima reacts to low salinity stress by
gradual, but significant release of its symbionts. This was found to
happen over a 20 day period in laboratory manipulations after a 4
day stress in 17 ppt and 25 ppt water. After 16 days post-stress the
numbers of algae in experimental animals were significantly lower
than those from unstressed animals. A salinity 10 ppt was too low
for survival.
Samples collected from the field did not show signs of a
bleaching event. This component of the experiment was parallel to
an investigation by Engebretson and Martin, 1994, examining
bleaching in A. elegantissima found in LA County, March 1992.
Bleaching occurred in the field, but only 5 months after the heavy
rains (Engebretson pers. com.). It would be interesting to return to
Carmel Point in mid August to further investigate the effects of the
March flooding. Perhaps by that time effect of the flooding, if any,
would be detectable.
Engebretson and Martin also experimented with salinity stress
in a controlled lab environment, however their treatments were less
environmentally applicable. They kept their animals immersed in
hyposaline water (8 ppt, 16 ppt, and 24 ppt) for 21 days which is
unlikely length of stress in the field. This strong treatment resulted
in a bleaching event. My treatments which were 1/5 the length of
this stress, still induced cell loss, but at a slower rate.
