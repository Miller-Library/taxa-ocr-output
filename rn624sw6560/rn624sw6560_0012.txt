DDT is toxic because of its tendency to accumulate
in tissues and hence cause an effect over a longer period
of time. This long range effect is probably responsible
for the lower calcification rates of regenerating spines
of the White's Point urchin. Longer time studies of the
effect of pesticide residues should be done - and ideally
on more animals than analyzed here. Trace metal effects
should also be studied. Cadmium especially has been
known to effect calcium metabolism (Nilsson, 1970) and
should be examined in the animals at White's Point. In
conclusion, it is not certain whether DDT is the major
cause of the abnormal spination of the sea urchins at
White's Point; however it probably is at least partly
responsible because there are high DDT residue concenÂ¬
trations in the spine tissues, and high DDT concentrations
do seem to inhibit calcification rates.
