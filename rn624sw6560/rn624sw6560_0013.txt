SUMMARY
.
1. Sea urchins found at White's Point, Los Angeles County,
were missing many of their major spines and appeared
to be in an unhealthy condition. Very high levels of
DDT residues (mainly DDE) were found in animals collect¬
ed around the White's Point area, especially in the
spines which had more than 200 ppb. In contrast, DDT
residues were barely detectable in healthy appearing
animals from Pigeon Point, San Mateo County.
2. Uptake studies using C-DDT showed that non-regener¬
ating spines incubated in vivo tended to lose initially
absorbed levels of DDT and equilibrate at about O.5
ppb after 1 hour. Regenerating spines incubated in
vitro showed the opposite trend, concentrating DDT
with time; levels of 419 ppb were reached in 48 hours,
Calcium uptake by regenerating spines in vitro from
animals collected at Pigeon Point was not affected
significantly by DDT concentrations less than 1 g/ml
but was affected by concentrations greater than 1 ug/ml,
when the drug precipitated from the sea-water.
4. Calcium uptake rates by spines of one specimen of S.
purpuratus collected at White's Point was lower than
that in the specimens collected at Pigeon Point and,
although they were not affected by external DDT con¬
centrations up to 10 g/ml, levels already present
in the spines may have suppressed calcification.
5. It is suggested that the stunted spination of the sea
