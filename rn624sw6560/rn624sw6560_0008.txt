C
showed a comparable DDT content to the levels found in
White's Point urchins (see Fig. 3).
DDT Effect on Calcification:
There was no effect on Ca uptake by DDT on the
spines of animals from Pigeon Point tested at concentra¬
tions of DDT up to 1 ug/ml. However, when the concentra¬
tion was raised above the saturation concentration of
1.2 ug/ml (Salk, 1969), there was a striking decrease
(32% at 10 ug DDT/ml) in calcium absorbed between spines
exposed to DDT and controls not exposed to DDT (Fig. 5).
DDT, even at concentrations of 10 jg/ml, had no ef-
fect on calcium uptake in spines of the White's Point
S. purpuratus (6A - Fig. 6). However, the amount of Ca
taken up by this specimen, even without DDT in the incu¬
bation medium, was relatively low in comparison to amounts
of Ca taken up by the spines of urchins from Pigeon
Point (see Fig. 5). Indeed, amounts of Ca taken up by
spines of the spines of the White's Point animal incubated
without DDT was most similar to that amount of Ca taken
up by spines of the Pigeon Point animal incubated in 10
ng DDT/ml (Fig. 7). The uptake of Ca45 in regenerating
spines of a 10 gram animal from White's Point was also
measured without exposure to DDT; the value of Cat ab-
sorbed was 9.6 ng f 1 ng (compared to 16.24 for the 30
gram specimen shown in Table 1 and Figs. 6A and 7).
