DISCUSSION
C1DDT Uptake by Spines:
The results of the uptake study (see Fig. 4) show
that spines regenerating in vitro do take up DDT at con-
centrations of 5 ng DDT/ml and hence probably do so at
the higher concentrations used during the calcification
experiments. The in vivo curve of non-regenerating spines
is interesting in that it shows that DDT taken up in the
first 5 minutes, probably by adsorption, is somehow lost
until equilibrium is reached after about 1 hour. The fate
of the lost DDT is unknown. Perhaps the DDT is translocat¬
ed into the urchin until it reaches equilibrium. Another
possible explanation is mucous secretion of the spines
and subsequent loss of mucus containing high concentra¬
tions of DDT.
DDT Effect on Calcification:
The high levels of pesticide residues found in the
White's Point specimens are in accordance with the high
pesticide residue concentrations in the water and sedi¬
ments around the sewer outfall (Carry and Redner, 1970)
Moreover, because the spines are almost 99% inert calcium
carbonate by weight, the actual DDT content per weight
of organic tissue is much higher than indicated in Figs.
3 and 4. Marian (1971), Burnett (1971), and Swarbrick
(1971) also found very high DDT residue concentrations
in other animals in the White's Point area. However,
whether these high levels of DDT residues are responsi¬
