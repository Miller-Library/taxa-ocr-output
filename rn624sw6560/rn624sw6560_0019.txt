1. Map of California showing collection sites of Pigeon
Point and White's Point.
2. Effect of ethanol of Calcium-45 uptake by regenerating
spines of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus;the means and
standard deviations are shown.
3. Measured DDT residue levels found in Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus collected at White's Point. T-DDT, D-DDD.
E-DDE,
4. Carbon-14 DDT uptake rates by spines of Strongylocen¬
trotus purpuratus in vivo (not regenerating) and in
vitro (regenerating).
5. Effect of DDT on Calcium-45 uptake by in vitro regen¬
erating spines of 3 specimens of Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus (A,B,C) collected at Pigeon Point; the means
and standard deviations are shown.
6. Effect of DDT on Calcium-45 uptake of in vitro regen¬
erating spines of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (A)
and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus (B) collected at
White's Point; the means and standard deviations are
shown.
Comparison of Calcium-45 uptake of in vitro regener¬
ating spines of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus from
White's Point and Pigeon Point exposed to the same
concentrations of DDT; the means and standard devia¬
