actually 1500 to 3600 meters offshore) discharged an aver¬
age of 1.44 million cubic meters (380 million gallons) of
primary treated sewage per day with an average concentra¬
tion of 34 ppb of chlorinated hydrocarbons (105 lbs. per
day) almost all of which were DDT metabolites. Therefore,
there may be a correlation between high DDT residue con¬
centrations in the area, and the abnormal spination of
sea urchins from White's Point; this is examined in the
present paper by studying calcification rates of spines
of S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus regenerating in vitro.
Heatfield (1970) studied calcification of regenerat-
ing spines of S. purpuratus using calcium-45 as a radio¬
active tracer. He examined the effects of time, tempera¬
ture, and inhibition of carbonic anhydrase on calcium up¬
take in regenerating spines. Heatfield's system was very
sensitive to calcium metabolism and therefore provides
a convenient method for examining the possible effect of
DDT on calcification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens:
Specimens were collected at both White's Point on
16 May 1971, and Pigeon Point on 22 April 1971 (Fig. 1).
Only specimens that appeared to be distinctly unhealthy,
including both S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus, were
collected at White's Point from 1 to 3 meters of water.
Pigeon Point urchins (S. purpuratus only) were collected
