calcification experiments on regenerating sea urchin spines,
the total percentage of ethanol in sea-water was less than
or equal to 0.91%.
Carbon-14 DDT Uptake:
In vivo DDT uptake was measured by adding 0.2 ml of
1 ug/mlC-DDT (Amersham/Searle - 19.1 mCi/milli-mole)
in 95% ethanol to 2 liters of filtered sea-water in which
4 specimens of S. purpuratus form Pigeon Point were placed.
These animals all weighed approximately 30 grams. At time
intervals one spine (that had not been fractured) was re¬
moved from each urchin, weighed, and placed in a plastic
scintilaation vial with 1 ml of NCS Solubilizer (Amersham/
Searle). After 5 minutes in NCS, 10 ml of scintillation
fluid (4 grams 2,5-di-phenyloxazole (PPO) and 0.1 gram
1,4-bis- 2-(5-phenyloxazole)
benzene (POPOP) per liter
toluene) was added. Counts were quantified by the channel
ratio technique with corrections made for quenching (nu¬
clear Chicago Liquid Scintillation Counter Mark II).
For in vitro uptake measurements, spines first frac-
tured as previously described and then allowed to regen¬
erate for 6 days on the urchin were then removed and
placed in 250 ml beakers containing 20 ml of filtered
sea-water with 0.1 ml of 1 ppm C-DDT in ethanol added.
(15 stubs from 3 S. purpuratus collected at Pigeon Point
were placed in 3 beakers.) The concentration of C-DDT
in the in vitro experiments (5,000 ppg/ml) was 50 times
higher than that in the in vivo experiment (100 pug/ml).
Assay for C was done in the same way as for the in vivo
experiment.
