from the intertidal region; all were very healthy in ap-
pearance. The urchins were maintained at Hopkins Marine
Station in running sea-water kept at 15 C I I C and fed
unlimited amounts of the brown algae, Macrocystis integ-
rifolia.
Measured Pesticide Residue Levels:
Pesticide residue levels in tissues of S. purpuratus
were measured by gas chromatography using the techniques
developed by Stanley and LeFavoure (1965) and Kadoum (1967)
except that smaller amounts of tissues were used (0.5 to
2.5 grams versus about 100 grams) and the digest medium
used for the spine extraction was 12N HCl. The gonads,
spines, lantern structure, and coelomic fluid of 3 Pigeon
Point urchins and the spines and gonads of 2 White's Point
urchins and the gonads of an additional animal were ana-
lyzed for DDT residues. Only very unhealthy appearing spec¬
imens from White's Point were analyzed, while the speci¬
mens from Pigeon Point appeared normal.
Measurement of DDT Effects on Calcification:
Heatfield (1970) found no difference in calcium up¬
take rates of spines regenerating in vitro and in vivo;
linear rates of calcium uptake were established in 4 days.
Accordingly, spines analyzed for DDT effects on calcium¬
45 uptake were allowed to regenerate in vivo for 4 days
before being exposed to test conditions in vitro. The
spines from healthy urchins (Pigeon Point) were all taken
from the 2 major rows of primary spines of each of 5 in¬
terambulacral plates to minimize effects due to size
