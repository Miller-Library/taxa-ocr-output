Heatfield (1970) found that complete inhibition of
carbonic anhydrase, an important enzyme involved in cal¬
cium metabolism, only resulted in a partial suppression
of calcium uptake in regenerating spines of S. purpuratus.
Past studies of the effect of DDT and its metabolites on
calcification, specifically on the enzyme carbonic anhy¬
drase, have been conflicting. Peakall (1970) and Bitman
et.al.(1970) noted that DDT induced inhibition of carbon-
ic anhydrase in the shell glands of birds. Keller (1952)
observed inhibition of carbonic anhydrase extracted from
bovine red blood cells and Nance (1969) found DDT inhibit¬
ed carbonic cnhydrase purified from Mytilus californianus
and Tequla funebralis as well as bovine red blood cells.
However, Anderson and March (1956) found no inhibition
by DDT of carbonic anhydrase extracted from cockroaches,
and recnetly Maren, et.al.(1971) retested the effects of
DDT on carbonic anhydrase taken from bovine red blood
cells and found no effect in concentrations less than
500 mg DDT/ml. Maren did observe a partial suppression
of calcium uptake, however, at concentrations above
500 mg DDT/ml where DDT was found to precipitate out of
solution. Precipitation of DDT from sea-water was also
noted to take place in experiments done in concentrations
above 1 ug DDT/ml (5C and 6A). The partial effect (32% in
Pigeon Point urchins and 50% between controls of speci¬
mens 50 and 6A could then possibly be due to a carbonic
anhydrase-independent element of the calcification mechanism.
