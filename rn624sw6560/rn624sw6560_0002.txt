INTRODUCTION
Pearse, et.al.(1970) noted that sea urchins (both
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franÂ¬
ciscanus) in the White's Point area of Palos Verdes Pen-
insula, Southern California, were without many of their
major spines, suggesting an unhealthy condition. Moreover,
the proportion of unhealthy sea urchins in the area appears
to have increased between September 1970 and May 1971
(J.S. Pearse, personal communication). The cause of the
unhealthy condition is unknown, but high levels of DDT
residues in the area suggests a possible cause.
Burnett (1971) found extremely high levels of DDT
residues in the sand crab, Emerita analoga, only a few
miles from White's Point (10 ppm in the whole animal).
Swarbrick (1971) analyzed specimens of Pagurus samuelis
collected at White's Point and found DDT residue levels
4 times greater than levels found in the Monterey Bay or
San Francisco Bay areas. Marian (1971) also found DDT
residue levels in Hermissenda crassicornis that were much
higher than those found in the Monterey Bay area. Carry
and Redner (1970) reported that the Los Angeles County
sewer outfall located at White's Point (dispersion is
