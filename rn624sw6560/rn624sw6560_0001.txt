ABSTRACT
Sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strong-
ylocentrotus franciscanus) in the vicinity of the Los An¬
geles County sewer outfall at White's Point have abnormal
spination (stunted and missing primary spines). There are
very high DDT residue levels (mainly DDE) in the tissues
of these animals compared with normal appearing animals
found at Pigeon Point, San Mateo County. Calcification
rates in regenerating spines of S. purpuratus from White's
Point were one-half the rates of regenerating spines of
S. purpuratus from Pigeon Point. DDT in concentrations
above 1 ug/ml appears to supress calcification in regen-
erating spines of S. purpuratus from Pigeon Point while
no suppression of calcium uptake occurred in regenerat¬
ing spines of S. purpuratus from White's Point exposed
to DDT concentrations up to 10 pg/ml. Accumulated pesti¬
cide residues contained in the spines of the White's Point
urchins apparently suppresses calcification and may be
a major cause of their stunted, abnormal appearing spina-
tion.
