ACKNON LEDGEMENTS
This work was done as undergraduate research in
Biology 175H at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Uni¬
versity. I would like to thank the entire staff and grad¬
uate students of Hopkins Marine Station for all the under-
standing and help they gave so generously. Especially I
would like to thank Dr. John S. Pearse for his help in
collecting specimens at White's Point, designing exper¬
ments, and for critically reading this manuscript. I
would also like to thank Dr. Vicki B. Pearse for her help
in using the Automatic Scintillation Counter, Phillip R.
Murphy for his help with preparing necessary equipment,
and Robin Burnett for his invaluable background study of
the White's Point area.
