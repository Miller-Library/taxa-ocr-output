RESULTS
Measured Pesticide Residue Levels:
In the 3 specimens collected at Pigeon Point and
analyzed for pesticide residues, only the gonads showed
a trace of DDE, between 0.5 and lng/g (ppb), near the
detection limit of the gas chromatograph. No detectable
amounts of DDE, DDD, or DDT were found in the spines,
lantern structure, or coelomic fluid.
In contrast to the specimens collected at Pigeon
Point, 3 animals collected at White's Point, that were
maintained at Hopkins Marine Station for 2 weeks and then
analyzed, had measurable amounts of DDT residue (mainly
DDE) in their tissues (Fig. 3). The DDT residue levels in
the spines of 2 animals were about twice the levels found
in their gonads. The spines of the third specimen were
not analyzed but it is likely that they also had a higher
content of DDT residues than the gonads, which would
mean their content would be well over the 420 ppb found
in the gonads.
-DDT Uptake Rates:
Uptake studies showed a striking difference between
spines incubated in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4). While
spines incubated in vitro (regenerating) took up DDT with
increasing time, spines still attached to urchins (not
regenerating) lost their initial content of DDT until they
equilibrized after 1 hour to approximately a constant
level. Spines incubated in vitro for 48 hours at 5 ng DDT/ml
