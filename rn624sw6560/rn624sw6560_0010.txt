ble for the unhealthy appearance of the urchins at White's
Point is not certain.
Statistical analysis (Table 1) shows that calcifica¬
tion in only 1 animal (50) from Pigeon Point was suppressed
by DDT and suppression occurred at concentrations above
jg DDT/ml. In contrast, the S. purpuratus (6A) from
White's Point showed no suppression at the same concen¬
trations of DDT in sea-water (1,5,10 ug DDT/ml). However,
as Figure 7 shows, calcium uptake in the regenerating
spines of the White's Point specimen (6A), incubated with¬
out DDT, was similar to the suppressed calcium uptake by
the spines of the Pigeon Point animal (5C). A possible
explanation is the size difference between the stunted
primary spines of the White's Point in comparison to the
normal spines of the Pigeon Point urchin. However, the
uptake of calcium by the S. franciscanus (6B) specimen
collected at White's Point, which had spines at least
twice the size of normal spines of S. purpuratus, was not
significantly different from amounts of calcium taken up
by spines of the S. purpuratus collected at White's Point
(6A). This suggests that size difference is not the major
cause of the different amounts of calcium taken up by
spines incubated without DDT from Pigeon Point and White's
Point. It seems more probable,he that the high
levels of DDT residues present in the spines of the
White's Point urchins (see Fig. 3) inhibit normal calcium
uptake and mask the effect of additional amounts of DDT
added to the water.
