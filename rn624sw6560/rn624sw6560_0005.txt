differences. This was not possible for animals collected
at White's Point because the extremely unhealthy specimems
chosen had few spines and it was difficult to get just
the 25 spines necessary for the experiment.
All individual experiments were done with spines
from the same animal. The spines (about 40 per animal)
were fractured 3 mm above the milled rings as specified
by Heatfield (1970) and allowed to regenerate for 4 days
still attached to the animal. After 4 days the stubs were
removed intact and gently placed in 4 250 ml beakers (about
10 spines per beaker) containing 1 uci/ml calcium-45 (Amer¬
sham/Searle - 71.4 mCi/milli-mole) in 20 ml of artificial
sea-water maintained at 15 C I 1 C. Additional amounts of
ethanol (0.02, 0.1, and 0.2 ml) of different concentrations
of DDT (0.1 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml) were added to test sol¬
utions. After 24 hours the stubs were removed from the
solutions and assayed for calcium-45 uptake as described
by Heatfield (1970)
Ethanol Controls:
Since ethanol was being added to test solutions, it
was essential to isolate any effects due to ethanol.
Therefore, controls with varying amounts of ethanol were
analyzed for effects on calcium uptake. Concentrations of
ethanol up to 0.91% in sea-water had no effect on the rate
of calcification (Fig. 2). Salk (1969) found a similar
break at 0.95% ethanol in sea-water in his calcification
experiments with S. purpuratus larvae. Therefore, in all
