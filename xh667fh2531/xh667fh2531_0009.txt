Bohaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 9
Disoussion
On the basis of all the above results and many other
shorter term and more qualitative field observations, a
bi emerges
generalized picture of the movement of P.
(Fig. 7). The activity of Fucellia seems related most
strongly with temperature, which shows diurnal fluotuations
both on the beach and in wrack banks. Fucellia become active
the day and tend to remain between temperature extremes,
during
The relationship to warmer sand temperatures at night compares
to the association with the warmer surface layers of the wrack
at night. Second in importance to temperature is the presence
of the wrack low on the beach, which can spread out the
distribution of flies, even at night, as seen in Fig. 7.
Coelopa vanduzeei range only at LOW and MID beach. Fucellis
have a much greater range of activity up and down the beach.
Observations on the distribution of fly larvae on the beach
correlates well with these observations (Kompfner,1972)
The two studies on Coelopa indicate that it is not darkness
or lower temperatures but rather the rising high tide and the
disappearance of the LOW wrack banks which correlate with the
observed peaks of activity. Physical factors which affect
wrack banks and the vertical zonation of flies in them are very
likely the most important factors influencing the behaviour of
Coelora.
Dispersal of marked flies
Another facet of distribution is the tendency of a
