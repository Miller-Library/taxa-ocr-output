showing population distributions of F. ruilibia under various
combinations of conditions. Day and night are shown but do not
represent a time axis. B and H show conditions with loss of
wrack during the day; E and K with newly deposited wrack; A,F,
G.L, show older wrack beds. F and L show distributions after
loss of wrack at night, while A and G also represent conditions
with newly deposited wrack during the day,

Each dot (B-F) represents the location of one marked fly. Scale
is shown by the 25 meter transect line. The dotted line shows
the limits of the preceding high tide, and the wavy line shows
the water level at the time of observation. The fly at the far
right in B was observed at +6 hours.
