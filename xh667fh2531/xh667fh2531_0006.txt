layers retain heat during the early night hours, which may
be related to the presence of Fucellia at night in a deeper
distribution than during the day. If the wrack bank is allowed
to sit for a few days, bacterial decomposition raises the
temperature of the wrack interior, providing a beautiful
environment for fly larvae (Remmert,1960b). In general
Fucellia are associated with the dryer, warmer surface layers
and Coalopa with the wet, mucous interior.
Intraspecific relationships or competition might also
contribute to zonation. Often C. vanduzeei are present in such
- +
great numbers, especially with newly deposited Macrocysul
wrack, as to exclude F. ruf
bia. While adequate documentation
is lacking, there is a suggestion that a zonation resembling
that inside wrack banks may occur over the surface of the beach
when lower wrack banks are disrupted. The phenomenon of the
bands of Coelopa at, and Fucellia above, the high water line may
roflect this, although it is complicated by the fact that under
these conditions Coelopa seek out the next higher wrack flakes
or holdfasts.
Distribution, Activity, and Movement
Methods
In order to follow the movement and distribution of flies
on the beach, two 24 hour studies were performed at periods
when relations of day and night to high and low tide were
eseentially opposite. For each study two collection techniques
were used, at two and four hour intervals: 1) sweeps with
