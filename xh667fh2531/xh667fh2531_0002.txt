European wrack diptera have been studied mainly as members
of the wrackfauna (Backlund,1945; Egglishaw,1960a,1960b).
Backlund speculated on relationships of Fucellia maritima,
F. frigida, F. fucorum and Coelopa to the wrack, but was more
concerned with dipterous larvae and other residents of the
wrack. Remmert's investigations of the beach flies of Germany
(1960a,1960b,1960c,1965) were broader and included the
structural differences between F
Tucellia intermedia and both
igida and C. pilipes as they might relate to different
Coelonaf
living habits in the beach wrack. He also discussed in more
detail many of the physical factors which influence the wrack
fauna, such as temperature, humidity, salinity, immersion, and
season. No major contributor to the study of wrack fauna has
yet presented a broader picture of the relation and activity of
beach flies to the whole beach, including the wrack itself.
Wrack banks and associated populations of beach flies are
common on California beaches. These flies have been studied
taxonomically (Aldrich,1918) but little is known of their
activity and role in the beach community. The present studies
of the distribution and behaviour of Fucellia rufitibia Stein,
pelopa vanduzeei Cresson, and to a lesser extent Leptocera
asoni Spuler were carried out during April and May, 1972 on
