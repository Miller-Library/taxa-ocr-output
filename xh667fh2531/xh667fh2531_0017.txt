Fig. 1. The study site, a protected sandy beach just west of
Hopkins Marine Station. Small wrack banks dot the lower beach.
Fig. 2. Zonation of flies, day and night, in exposed 15 cm high
mixed wrack banks. Range and relative density of flies is
indicated by the length and width of the vertical bands.

Fig. 3. Distribution and movement of F.
24-hr studies made under opposite conditions of tides, April
(Pacific Standard Time,

20-21 and April 27-28, 1972. The number of Ilies is expressed
in the boxes as per cent(ÃŸ) of sample (N) at each collection
time at each successive level down the beach transect.
Abundance and location of wrack are shown. A solid black line
connects the population midpoints at each sampling time.
Fig. 4. Distribution of F. rufitibia with the temperature of
the top l om of sand. The movement curves from Fig. 3A,B are
superimposed on a chart of sand temperatures at each position
on the beach at each sample time.
Fig. 5. Distribution and activity of C. vandu
ei in a 24-hr
study from April 27-28, 1972 (time is Pacific Standard Time).
A shows the number and location of flies captured on the beach
at each sample time. E shows the total number of flies caught
by the net and Remmert bag. Tidal cycle and the presence of
wrack are indicated.
