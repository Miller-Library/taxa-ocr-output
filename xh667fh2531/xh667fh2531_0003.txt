Behaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 3
a sandy beach at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove,
California. These species werechosen out of the many other
species of Ephydridae, Canaceidae, Empididae, Dolichipodidae,
and other Fucellia and Leptocera collected on this beach because
they occur in great abundance, exhibit a specific relationship
to the wrack and yet range over the entire beach. The results
show that each species of fly exhibits specific vertical
zonation within a wrack bank and that there are clear species
differences in range and distribution over the beach.
The study site
Field work was carried out on a protected sandy beach just
west of Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific Grove, California
(Fig. 1). The beach faces the northwest, curves slightly at
the water's edge, and is bordered on each side by rocks. I
established a 25 meter transect from the terrestrial area above
the beach down the sand slope to the water. In the transect
area, the beach was divided into five regions or bands 65 meters
long running parallel to the waterline: 1) the terrestrial

band(
TER) above the sandy portion of the beach, a zone never
covered with water; 2) the high beach(HI), a sandy region
covered with water only during high tides in stormy weather;
(MT
3) the middle beachnD), a band immersed by the highest tides
(above +1.52 m); 4) the low beach (LOW), a zone regularly
covered with water at tides of +0.9 to -1.52 m; and 5) the low
low beach(L LOW), usually exposed only during low tides.
