an insect net along each horizontal band (TER, HI, MID, LOW)
across the beach, and 2) a modified Remmert bag (Remmert, 1960a)
for periodic sampling. The latter consisted of a large plastic
bag., layered on the bottom with fresh, mixed wrack and then
N7TI
positioned with the wrack exposed to the air at HI, MID, and
LOW beach locations. The net captures those flies on the wing
or those which can be swept up into a net, while the bags trap
those flies which settle down inside the wrack after a period of
exposure. Flies caught in the net were etherized in the field.
counted, and released in the capture area. At sampling times,
each Remmert bag was quickly closed over its contents and taken
into the laboratory. A new Remmert bag was always left in its
place for the next collection period. On shaking,the flies
moved into the upper portion of the bag which was then constricted
in the middle. Flies were removed, etherized, counted, and
returned to the field. At each collecting period, the
temperatures of the air and top 1 cm of the sand were recorded.
the tide level and the presence of wrack were noted, and general
observations were made.
Results
The results of the two 24-hour studies for F. rufitibia
snow that diel movements up and down the beach.
even under two
different tidal patterns, are basically similar
(Fig. 3). The
differences in amplitude of the movement up the beach on the
two nights may be due to the presence or absence
of wrack low
on the beach. The movement of Fucellia up the beach toward
nightfall coincides with drops in air and sand temperatures,
