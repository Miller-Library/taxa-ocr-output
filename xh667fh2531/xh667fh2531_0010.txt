Dehaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 10
population to disperse. Mark and release experiments were
performed to provide some measure of this. Two hundred F.
ufitibig were etherized and marked with a dot of yellow enamel
paint on the back of the thorax. Flies were revived, checked
to be sure they were able to fly, and then released at their
site of capture on the beach. This site was a large mixed
wrack bank which persisted on the beach for six days after
release. Marked flies were visible at a distance of 1-2 meters
and were counted in this manner as well as recaptured in the
insect net. Marked flies seen were located close to the point
of release at the times of observation (Fig. 8). A few flies
were found at greater distances and one Fucellia was spotted
over 100 meters from release, but it is also apparent that many
flies remained in the wrack at night and did not migrate up the
beach(Fig. 80,D). Ira control group, 22 cf 25 marked F.
tibia survived in the laboratory for six days.

A similar experiment was also performed, using 150 C.
wanduzeei marked with orange enamel paint. Results here were
quite different; none of the flies marked and released was
ever seen again.
The results show Fucellia do not disperse widely and
rapidly, but seem rather to constitute moderately stable
communities on the beach. The failure to observe marked
lopa after release may not indicate wide dispersion but
perhaps the tendency of Coelopa to bury themselves inside
wrack banks, though wrack banks were not searched for marked
flies.. On the other hand Coelopa are gregarious, always found
in large groups in and on the wrack and on the beach surface.
