Behaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 12
preference shown for Phyllospadix, especially at MID beach, by
both Fucellid and Coelopa.
Remmert (1965) bred both Fucellia and Coelopa for a few
generations in homogeneous samples of red, brown, and green
algae and the eel grass Zostera. He reported that red algae
were poisonous for the flies, Zostera did not suffice as food
for them, green algae provided good food but were scarce in
wrack, and that brown algae were preferred above all other plants
by both fly species. My own preference studies provide no
information on the utilization or value of wrack as food. Many
of my field observations, like those of Remmert, show that
flies prefer brown algae above all others. Not only were whole
tis plants found swarming with flies, but larvae were
r
almost exclusively associated with brown algae, even inside
mixed wrack banks (Kompfner,1972). However, while red algae
were least preferred, flies were still present and the effects
of a toxicity, if it exists, were not observed.
My preference tests appeared to sample those transitory
fly populations which at times must occupy the MID and HI beach
locations during disruptive high tides. In these cases a fly
may not be looking for wrack as food or a permanent home or a
site to reproduce but merely as temporary shelter. Here, the
structural characteristics of the wrack may be more important,
and this could explain the strong preference for Phyllospadix.

By analogy, the dry, tangled, maze-like holdfasts of Macrod

on the high beach, mentioned earlier, attract Coelona by the
thousands at certain times when the LOW wrack banks have been
destroyed or are threatened by the high tide. This attraction
