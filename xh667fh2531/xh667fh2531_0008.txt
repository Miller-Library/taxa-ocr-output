Behaviour of Wrack Diptera --8
During dusk and early evening, flies are often found dotting
the open surface of MID and HI beach. The typical daytime
behaviour of active flying and movement is replaced by passivity
and walking. The large numbers(N) taken at night reflect the
ease of capturing flies in this susceptible state. Figure 4
shows that Fucellia rufit
aare generally not found in the
warmest sand locations on the beach during the day and not the
coldest sand temperatures at night. In fact it seems as if
ucellia escape extreme heat in the day and cold at night.
preferring a middle range of temperatures,
A different pattern of behaviour was observed for C.
ndureei(Fig. 5). Whereas Fucellia were observed travelling
up and down the beach, Coelopa were nearly always found at LOW
D:TI
and MiD beach and very rarely at higher beach locations. At
1000 many Coelopa were netted. At midnight during tidal ebbing.
more flies were found in the Remmert bags. With the reappearance
of wrack at 0400, few Coelona were caught with either method,
perhaps as more flies reinhabited the natural wrack. This
activity pattern is associated with the day to night transition,
the drop in temperature, changes in humidity and tidal level
with the loss of low wrack banks. In another study(see Wrack
preference, below), a similar activity pattern was found to
occur with the high tides which immersed the LOW wrack banks
