Behaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 5
espeolally Coelopa, do not fly out but retreat deoper into the
wrack also with audible buzzing. Most flies escape from the
wrack and move onto the open beach when the tide washes over the
wrack banks. Fucellia then settle in a wide band of many flies
om the beach above the highest water line and display a tendency
to move down the beach to the small pieces of wrack deposited
with each retreating wave. Coalopa either settle to form a band
of flies at the water line or hide at the sand-wrack interface
of the next highest wrack flakes or wrack strings along with
johnsoni. In addition to wrack flakes and strings, dry

tis holdfasts often dot the beach at MID and HI beach
locations. These are usually uninhabited by diptera, but at
times when the wrack banks low on the beach are washed away,
they become filled with thousands of C. vanduzeei.
The vertical zonation in low mixed wrack banks is not always
displayed. When large sections of Macro

fewer Coelopa occur on the surface but most occupy the damp.

outnumbered but may be present as individuals.
Factors determining the zonation in mixed wrack banks were
not determined. Certainly newly deposited mixed wrack is very
much the same in physical characters -- composition, wetness.

the wet interior with a dry envelope. In these early stages.
the top layers are much warmer than the inner wrack, thus both
temperature and moisture gradients are present. The surface
