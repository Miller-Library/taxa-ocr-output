Eehaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 11
Large swarms of Coelopa have been observed travelling
laterally across the lower beach. There are also days when
the beach appears to be empty of flies. It would be interesting
to know where the flies are on these days.
Wrack preference
The composition of wrack banks and flakes available on
the beach varies considerably with place and time. An experiment
was performed to see which component of wrack might be preferred
by the wrack flies. Small piles of wrack, 25-30 cm in diameter
and 5-10 cm high, were established on the beach; one pile each
Dhy
of red algae, brown algae, just pullospadix, and mixed wrack.
Six such sets of four piles each were laid out at HI and MID
beach positions over several days in different sequences (red.
brown, mixed, Phyllospadix; brown, Phyllospadix, red, mixed; etc.).
Flies associated with each pile were sampled at selected
intervals by simultaneously dropping an insect net over each of
the four piles in a given set and forcing the flies into the
net by agitating the wrack. The netted flies from each pile
were then etherized in the field, counted, and returned to the
same pile. It was also necessary to examine closely each
wrack pile for flies, usually Coelopa, which had not been forced
into the net.
The results(Fig. 9) show that no one component of wrack
enjoyed an exclusive preference over the others. Mixed and
brown algae proved equally attractive, while red algae always
contained the fewest flies. The surprising result was the great
