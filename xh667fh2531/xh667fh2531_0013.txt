Bohaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 13
seemingly has little to do with food, as the same holdfasts
are vacant of flies under most other conditions, but more
probably relate to shelter and protection. Similarly, a small
y
pile of tangled, intertwining L lospadix blades offers a
temporary shelter from the wind and dessication. Of the
choices offered, red algae usually dry to very stiff sheets and
do not provide much protection. Brown algae and mixed wrack,
usually dry on the surface, maintain a wet interior which flies
may inhabit.
Mating behaviour
The mounting behaviour of F. rufi
rutibia has been observed
very regularly in flies around piles of bird excrement, which
attract large numbers of flies. They are probably drawn by
the ammonia, amines, sulfides or fatty aoids, which may also
induce courting and reproductive behaviour (Jacobson &
Beroza, 1963). Mounting often ends quickly either because the
female is unreceptive or the male fails to maintain his clasp,
Often as one male hops off a female, others scramble for the
vacant position, especially with the density of Fucallia around
the bird excrement. Occasionally a successful mounting is
achieved and the pair may remain attached for 5-6 minutes.
Fucellia costalis Stein exhibits a different mating behaviour
not associated with the bird excrement and occuring over a wide
area of the beach. When the male nears the female for the firs
time, the female becomes frozen in place for at least one
minute, and the male alternates between standing still and
