Behaviour of Wrack Diptera -- 1
Abstract
The beach wrack flies Fucellia rufitibia, Coelopa vanduzeei,
and Lentocera johnsoni occupy successive vertical levels
inside banks of mixed wrack found low on California beaches.
When the wrack is washed away, Coelopa are then found at the
toe
sand-wrack flake interface with Lepppmra; Fucellia in a black
band of flies above the highest waterline. Fucellia range
widely up and down the beach. Movement to higher beach positions
at night seems to be associated with temperature, but some

ellia remain in the warmer surface layers of the lower wrack

banks at night. Coelora are usually only found at lower beach
positions where they inhabit the moist interior of wrack banks.
Moisture and tide level are the important factors in Coalona

behaviour. Mark and release experiements show that f.u
do not disperse widely but constitute moreorless fixed communities
on the beach. C. vanduzeei are gregarious. In wrack preference
experiments in the field, Fucellia and Coelopa exhibit strong
preference for the surf grass
lix, probably as a source
Phyllosrad
of shelter. Brown algae and mixed wrack are preferred to the
same degree; red algae very little.
