Behaviour of Wrack Diptera-- 4
Fresh wrack which is deposited low on this beach is nearly
always mixed wrack, composed mostly of the surf grass,
Ihyllosudi but with considerable amounts of red algae (Gigartina
and Iridaea) and brown algae (Macrocystis, Egregia, and I
iminaria).
Green algae contribute very little. Occasionally a large raft
of Macrocvstis washes up as a homogeneous pile of brown wrack.
Backlund's (1945) definitions of wrack forms were used and most
wrack deposited low on the beach constitute wrack banks.
Zonation of flies within the wrack
Individual wrack banks quickly become inhabited by flies.
different species occupying different levels in the wrack. To
determine zonation, samples of wrack at successive levels in
banks were collected rapidly and immediately sealed in plastic
bags. The fly populations were identified and counted in the
laboratory, and the flies then returned to the field.
Newly deposited mixed wrack banks allowed to sit in the
daytime for at least half a day exhibited vertical zonation
by species(Fig. 2). It was found that F. rufitibia occupies the
air above the surface and the top layers of the wrack banks.
Beneath lie C. vanduzeei, followed by L. johnsoni at the sand-
wrack interface. The distribution observed during the day shifts
downward at night such that Fucellia displace Coelopa in the top
rew centimeters. If the wrack bank is disturbed during the day,
both Fucellia and Coelopa distinctively buzz their wings,
nerge from the wrack in a very active state, and fly away.
When disturbed at night and during colder days, the flies,
