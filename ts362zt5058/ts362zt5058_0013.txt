The results from the uncaging experiments performed in this study support the theory of
cooperativity at the IPz receptor. Release of relatively high intracellular concentrations of IP;
(100nM) by flash photolysis results in a rapid increase in intracellular [Ca. Taking cooperative
binding into consideration, it is concluded that the undocumented portion of the rising phase due
to the speed limitations of the imaging equipment (see Materials and Methods) represents the
lower foot portion of the sigmoidal curve characteristic of cooperative binding
Gradual rising phase following flash photolysis suggests regeneration
An averaged cellular response to flash photolysis of caged IPz exhibits a rapid increase in
[Ca following uncaging, but a noticeably slower rise (1-2 seconds) to peak Ca levels (Fig. 4).
This gradual rise to maximum intracellular [Ca suggests a regenerative process at the level of
IPz receptor activation. Rather than achieving peak cytosolic Ca levels immediately, the peak is
attained through repeated activation of IP3 receptors. Researchers have theorized that
submicromolar concentrations of Ca“ can cause IPz receptors to reach threshold by altering the
receptor's binding affinity for IPz, thus activating the receptors and releasing additional Ca- into
the cytosol. This theory of a Ca“-induced Ca“ release at the IPz receptor (Finch et al., 1994 can
explain the apparent regenerative process observed following uncaging of IP3.
Flash photolysis of caged IPz abolishes wave propagation
The working model of Ca“ wave propagation in neuronal cells suggests an active process
underlying wave propagation. This process may involve an interaction between cytosolic Ca-
and IPz receptors at the wave front [Wang et al., 1995]. The model is based on the assumption
that IPz receptors are distributed throughout the entire cell, and not localized to a particular area.
