FIGURE 1: Calcium signal in response to bradykinin with high-affinity indicator. Example of
the dynamics of Ca“ release from a cell injected with FFP-18, K salt (ImM micropipette
concentration) and stimulated with bradykinin (100nM). Agonist is delivered at time-O, followed
by a 10-11 second latent period in which [Ca do not appreciably change. The latency is
followed by a 20 fold increase in [Ca over a 2-3 second time period. Intracellular Ca then
exhibits a slow decay, presumably toward resting levels.
FIGURE 2: Calcium signal in response to bradykinin with low-affinity indicator. Example of
the dynamics of Ca“ release from a cell loaded with mag-fura-2/AM (SuM) and stimulated with
bradykinin (100nM). Following stimulation (time-O), [Ca*1 do not appreciably change for a
period of 6-7 seconds. The latent period is followed by a 25 fold increase in cytosolic Ca over
a time interval of 2-3 seconds in which peak Ca“ levels are resolved. Following attainment of
peak [Ca-, a rapid decay to resting levels is observed.
FIGURE 3: Calcium signal in response to flash photolysis of caged IPz. Cells injected with
caged IPz plus fluo-3 (ImM micropipette concentrations) exhibit an instantaneous increase in
[Ca following flash photolysis. The flash used to uncage IPz is represented by the sudden
decrease in fluorescence caused by shutter closing. Cytosolic [Ca“ begins to rise within 200ms
following exposure to the flash, and attain peak levels within 1 second following flash.
FIGURE 4: Average response to flash photolysis of caged IPz. An average response of cells
(n-3) injected with caged IPz plus fluo-3 exhibits an immediate increase in cytosolic Ca
