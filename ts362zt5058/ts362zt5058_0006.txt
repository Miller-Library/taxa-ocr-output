analysis was done off-line on a Mega Vision 1024XM pipeline image processor (Mega Vision,
Santa Barbara, CA) frame by frame from data transferred from tape to a Panasonic TQ-2028F
optical disk recorder.
For FFP-18 injected cells, Ca“ kinetics were determined by monitoring cells continuously
for up to 60 seconds at 380nm excitation after initially obtaining Fzao/F3so. For fluo-3 injected
cells, Ca kinetics were determined by monitoring cells for up to 60 seconds at 525nm excitation
wavelengths. For caged IPz + fluo-3 injected cells, a brief (170us), maximum intensity flash (230
Joules, 360nm) from a Xenon Strobex lamp (Chadwick-Helmuth Co., El Monte, CA) was
focused directly onto the cell field to photolyse the caged IPz. Following flash illumination, Ca-
kinetics were resolved by monitoring cells for up to 30 seconds under 525nm light. A stroboflex
shutter was closed during the flash to protect the SIT camera. The reopening of the shutter is
associated with a time delay of 100ms. An additional delay of approximately 200ms is associated
with the delay in camera response time following shutter reopening.
Neurotransmitter application
Bradykinin (1OOnM) was applied by total replacement of the chamber volume using a
manually-controlled perfusion device.
Calcium and calcium wave analysis
Increases in intracellular Ca“ were observed following stimulation with 100nM
bradykinin. Responsive cells were identified by eye, reviewing the data played back at 1-4 times
normal speed. Changes in [Ca“ were measured in regions of interest corresponding to the
center of individual cell bodies. Baseline fluorescence, Fo, was defined as the average
