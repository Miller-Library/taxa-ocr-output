The results suggest that the latency observed prior to Ca release is characteristic of the
pathway (Fig. 6). They further suggest that neither the time of IPz diffusion from its site of
production to its receptors on the ER nor the time to Ca“ release following IPz receptor
activation significantly contribute to the latency observed following stimulation with
neurotransmitter. It is postulated that the latency arises earlier in the phosphoinositide signaling
pathway, perhaps at the level of IPz formation through hydrolysis of phosphotidyl inositol 4,5
bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C (PLCB1).
Cooperativity at the IP; receptor
In this set of studies, the exact delay to Ca“ release from storage pools could not be
resolved due to limitations in the fluorescence video imaging equipment. In particular, the 200ms
delay following photolysis before imaging is accounted for by the 10Oms shutter speed as well as
delay associated with camera response following shutter reopening (see Materials and Methods).
To avoid such limitations, a rapid photodetector such as a photodiode or PMT needs to be
employed.
Research on the IPz receptor suggests that the receptor exhibits the property of
cooperative binding [Meyer et al., 1988). The theory states that the binding of one IPs molecule
to the IPz receptor facilitates the binding of other IP3 molecules. In order for the receptor to
activate and thus serve as a channel for Ca“ release into the cytosol, 3 to 6 molecules of IPz need
to be bound. The highly cooperative opening of Ca" channels by nanomolar concentrations of
IPz enables cells to detect and amplify extremely small changes in the concentration of this
intracellular messenger in response to various stimuli.
