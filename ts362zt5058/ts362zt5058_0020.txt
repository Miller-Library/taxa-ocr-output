appreciably change. The peak level attained following bradykinin stimulation is lower than
observed following neurotransmitter stimulation due to insufficient time to refilling of Ca
storage pools as well as IPz receptor desensitization. Following peak Ca, fluorescence values
decay either linearly (neurotransmitter) or exponentially (IPz) to resting levels.
FIGURE 9: Calcium wave propagation in bradykinin stimulated cells. Ca rise begins with a
delay of 10-11 seconds after agonist stimulation (time-O) and spreads across the cell in a defined
wave-front (varying colors represent varying levels of fluorescence). Two separate waves
originate at opposite ends of the cell (soma and growth cone) and propagate toward one another
at 42um/s. Upon collision, the waves annihilate each other (arrow).
FIGURE 10: Flash photolysis of IP3 does not cause wave propagation. Following flash
photolysis (time-O), fluorescence (black) increases evenly throughout the cell, indicating
simultaneous Caâ€œ release and a lack of wave propagation.
