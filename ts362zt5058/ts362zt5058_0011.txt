Even as Ca continues to decrease and return to resting levels, Ca remains well above FFP-
18 saturation concentrations for a significant period of time, leading to the slow apparent decay.
FFP-18 is therefore better employed as an indicator when changes in Ca- are small (nanomolar
range).
Mag-fura-2 exhibits a rapid exponential decay to resting levels following attainment of
peak [Ca (Fig. 2). The indicator's low affinity for Ca allows it to achieve better resolution of
the 2uM peak in Ca following stimulation with bradykinin, thus making it an indicator of
choice in imaging experiments where changes in intracellular Caâ€œ are large (micromolar range).
Flash photolysis of caged IPz eliminates latency
Stimulation of neuronal cells with the neurotransmitter bradykinin results in a latent period
as long as 30 seconds in duration prior to release of Ca- from IPz receptor-regulated Ca storage
compartments in the ER (Fig. 1-2). By direct release of IPz into the cytosol using flash
photolysis, this latency is shown to be eliminated (Fig. 3-4). Within 200ms of photolysis,
intracellular [Ca begins to increase, reaching peak Ca" levels within 1-2 seconds, following
which levels decay exponentially. The time needed to reach half decay was measured to be 4.06s.
This decay time most likely correlates to the degradation time of IP3. This compares favorably
with biochemical measure of IPz degradation of approximately 9 seconds WWang et al., 19951
Prior to this half decay point, it is likely that several IPs receptors are still being activated by IP;
molecules remaining in the cytosol. Past the half decay point, it is postulated that all IP3 released
by flash photolysis has degraded, IPz receptors are inactive, and Ca- levels slowly return to
resting levels.
