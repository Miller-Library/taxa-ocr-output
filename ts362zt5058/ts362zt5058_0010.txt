the cell. The data suggests that each wave front travels uninterrupted for at least 30um at a speed
of 42um/s. Upon collision, the two waves annihilate each other (arrow). Annihilation is
consistent with the proposed theory of an active process underlying wave propagation through an
excitable medium [Wang et al., 19951.
Flash photolysis of caged IPz abolishes wave propagation
The activation of the IPz receptor through flash photolysis of caged IPz does not lead to
wave propagation (Fig. 10). Following photolysis (time-O), the change in fluorescence occurs
throughout the cell indicating that a Ca“ wave does not propagate. This result is consistent with
the working model of wave propagation that assumes the IPz receptor is distributed throughout
the cell, and not localized to a particular area.
DISCUSSION
Ca indicators exhibit unique decay phases
The use of FFP-18 as a Ca“ indicator is advantageous in allowing one to monitor changes
in Ca near intracellular membranes. However, its high affinity for Ca“ causes it to reach
saturation well before the Ca" signal peaks during stimulation with bradykinin. In contrast, mag¬
fura-2, a low-affinity Ca indicator, presents the advantage of displaying spectral shifts at high
Ca“ concentrations, allowing one to better resolve peak intracellular Ca. The difference in
binding affinity between these two indicators leads to fluorescence decay patterns that are unique
to the indicator following neurotransmitter stimulation. The slow decay to resting levels observed
in a cell injected with FFP-18 and stimulated with bradykinin (Fig. 1) suggests that FFP-18
reaches saturation well before maximum concentrations of intracellular Ca“ (2uM) are reached.
