IPz-dependent Ca“ release occurs in an organized manner, often taking the form of a
wave passing throughout the cell [Gilkey et al., 1978). Investigation into the Ca* wave
phenomena following agonist stimulation has led to a theory of wave propagation that relies on
the observation that Ca“ itself can act as a coagonist in triggering IPz-induced Ca- release Finch
et al., 1991). The model suggests a positive feedback loop that operates when intracellular IP,
levels are at threshold and if IPz-bound receptors are spaced closely enough that Ca- release
beginning at one receptor can bring neighboring IPz receptors to threshold for Ca release. The
local increase in Ca“ allows for further propagation of the Ca“ wave as the cycle continues down
the length of the cell [Wang et al., 1995). To test the model's assumption that IPz receptors are
distributed throughout the cell, analysis of wave propagation kinetics was conducted on cells
intracellularly injected with caged IPz.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the UCSF Cell Culture Facility,
maintained without antibiotics in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% bovine serum, and grown to passages 6-8. For
experimentation, cells were plated on glass coverslips. To initiate differentiation, the medium was
replaced with medium containing 2% dimethylsulfoxide. Cells were used 6-14 days following
differentiation [Wang et al., 19951.
