Microinjection of cells
After rinsing in Hank's buffer, pH 7.4, the cells were transferred to a heated chamber
(30°C) for microinjection. FFP-18, K salt (TEFLABS, Austin, TX) and fluo-3, pentaammonium
salt (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) were injected at 1mM concentrations using
an Eppendorf micromanipulator 5171 (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).
D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, P“-1-(2-nitrophenyl) ethyl ester, sodium (caged IPz,
trisodium salt - Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) and fluo-3, pentaammonium salt
(Calbiochem) were each dissolved at concentrations of ImM in saline containing SmM HEPES,
pH 7 at 20°C and microinjected using the Eppendorf micromanipulator. Injected caged IPz was
allowed to evenly distribute throughout the cell for 10 minutes or more. Assuming that injection
volumes were no more than 10% of the total cell volume, the concentration of each compound in
cells was no more than 1OOUM.
AM loading of cells
Cells were loaded with the low-affinity Ca" indicator mag-fura-2 by incubation in saline
containing 5uM mag-fura-2/AM and 0.0025% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 45 minutes
at 22°C.
Calcium imaging
Following loading, cells were transferred to a heated chamber (30°C) on the stage of a
Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope with 20x and 40x Fluor objectives (Nikon),
Hamamatsu C2400 silicon-intensified target camera, and a Panasonic VHS video tape recorder.
Excitation illumination by a Xenon arclamp was filtered through lOnm bandpass interference
filters at 340 or 380nm wavelengths for FFP-18 and 525nm wavelengths for fluo-3. Wave
