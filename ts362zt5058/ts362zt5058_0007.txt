fluorescence within the region of interest over 5-10 frames just prior to agonist application. The
fluorescence signal was converted to units of AF/F.
Ca“ waves were evoked in similar fashion as changes in intracellular Ca“. Waves were
identified by eye, viewing data played back at 1-4 times normal speed. For quantitative analysis of
wave motion, a line segment passing through the cell in the direction of wave propagation was
selected. Fluorescence was averaged over 1 to 3 pixels on either side of the line at a rate of 30
frames per second. Normalized lines of AF were stacked to generate images in which the y-axis
represented time and the x-axis represented location along the scanned line segment, yielding a
graph of wave position against time.
RESULTS
Properties of Ca indicators
Due to the wavelength needed to release caged IPz, my studies used fluo-3 as a
fluorescent Ca“ indicator. Fluo-3 is excited at longer wavelengths (525nm) than fura-2 and
related indicators (FFP-18, mag-fura-2), which are excited in the 340-380nm range, the same
spectral range in which caged compounds are photo-released. The lipophilic tail of FFP-18 allows
it to function as a near-membrane Ca“ indicator upon injection, allowing one to take advantage of
the fact that Ca“ levels near membranes rise faster and higher than in the cytosol. Mag-fura-2, a
low-affinity Ca“ indicator, presents the advantage of exhibiting spectral shifts at higher Ca-
concentrations (up to 100uM), allowing resolution of greater peaks in [Ca following
stimulation.
