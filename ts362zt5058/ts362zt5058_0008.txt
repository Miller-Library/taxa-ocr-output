Latency following bradykinin stimulation
The activation of B» receptors by bradykinin in cells injected with FFP-18 (ImM
micropipette concentration) or mag-fura-2 (lmM) results in a latent period (mean latency = 9.06
seconds) preceding a rise in intracellular [Ca (Fig. 1-2). [Ca increases to approximately
2uM (an estimated 20 fold increase from resting Ca“ levels) within 2-5 seconds following initial
response. The increase in [Ca is followed by a characteristic falling phase where fluorescence
exhibits a smooth decay to resting levels. The decay of mag-fura-2 appears more rapid than the
decay of FFP-18. The high affinity of FFP-18 for Ca“ causes it to reach saturation well before
peak Ca is attained, accounting for the slower apparent decay of the signal.
Latency following flash photolysis of caged IP;
Flash photolysis of cells injected with caged IPz plus fluo-3 (ImM micropipette
concentrations) does not exhibit a latent period prior to the rise in intracellular [Ca (Fig. 3).
Photolysis occurs instantaneously following shutter closure (see Materials and Methods) and is
represented by a decline in fluorescence. Response to uncaging in the single cell, illustrated in Fig
3., is characterized by an immediate rise (within 200ms) in [Ca, with peak levels reached in less
than 1 second. Peak [Ca corresponds to approximately 600nM (an estimated 6 fold increase
from resting levels). An averaged response to flash photolysis of caged IPz (Fig. 4) shows similai
results, but exhibits a noticeably slower rise to maximum Ca“ levels (2-3 seconds following
photolysis). The attainment of peak [Ca is followed by a falling phase where fluorescence
exhibits exponential decay to resting levels (Fig. 5). The time to one-half decay was measured to
be 4.06 seconds.
