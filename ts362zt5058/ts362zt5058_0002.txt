INTRODUCTION
Metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors are linked via second messenger pathways to
their intracellular effector targets. The bradykinin (Bk) B2 receptor subtype is coupled by the G-
protein Gyii to a wide variety of second messenger cascades, with one prominent effect being the
activation of the membrane-bound enzyme phospholipase C (PLCB1). PLC hydrolyzes
phosphotidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane to form inositol 1,4,5-
trisphosphate (IPz) and diacylglycerol (DAG) [Rhee et al., 19891, both of which act as
intracellular messengers. IPz diffuses in the cytosol to receptors on the surface of the endoplasmic
reticulum. Activation of the IPz receptor leads to release of Ca into the cytosol from Ca
storage compartments of the endoplasmic reticulum.
Surface receptors coupled to second messenger pathways characteristically mediate
responses which are slow in both onset and duration [Hartzell, 1981]. Response latencies as long
as 30 seconds in duration have been observed for B2 receptor activation in neuroblastoma cells
[Coggan et al., 1995]. The existence of such an appreciable delay between surface receptor
binding and cellular response has important consequences for the synaptic activation of cells
Described here is an investigation of possible origins of the latency of responses mediated by the
phosphoinositide signaling pathway in NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, a sympathetic
neuronal cell line which express a number of G-protein coupled receptors including B2, Hj, Mi,
and Ma receptors.
It has been suggested that the limiting factors determining response latency at high agonist
concentrations arise from stages in the phosphoinositide signaling cascade located between
receptor binding and IPz liberation. It was further suggested that at low agonist concentrations,
