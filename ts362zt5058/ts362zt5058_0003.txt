an additional delay is introduced due to intracellular levels of IPz rising slowly to a threshold
before triggering calcium release [Miledi et al., 1988). To test the prior theory, NIE-115 cells
were intracellularly injected with a photo-releasable IPz (caged IPz) and an appropriate fluorescent
Ca indicator (fluo-3)
Photolabile caged compounds are inert precursors of biologically active molecules that can
be loaded into cells and subsequently released in their active form. Uncaging is accomplished by a
flash of light (360nm) that triggers the breaking of photolabile bonds to release the bioactive
molecule. The absorption of photons excites the inert parent compound to a higher energy state
where it undergoes a reaction leading to the formation of a stable, physiologically active
biomolecule. Measurements of response latencies evoked by intracellular injection of bioactive
molecules are complicated by uncertainties regarding micropipette tip positioning, and also by the
difficulty in controlling injection volume. The use of caged compounds results in more accurate
measurements by eliminating such uncertainties, and by presenting the opportunity of both
controlling release and guaranteeing even distribution throughout the cell by simple diffusion
[Miledi et al., 19881
In this study, injected caged IPz was released by flash photolysis and changes in latency
preceding Ca“ release from internal stores was measured through fluo-3 imaging. The results
were then compared to response latency measured following surface receptor stimulation with
bradykinin. The objective was to determine whether the time of IPs diffusion to its receptors on
the ER and/or delay between receptor activation and Ca“ release significantly contributed to the
overall response latency. IPz has been shown to have a measured diffusion coefficient (D) of
283um'/s and a effective range lifetime of 24um [Allbritton et al., 19921. Thus for cells smaller
than 20um, IPz acts as a global messenger.
