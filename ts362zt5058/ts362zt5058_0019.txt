following flash photolysis. Rise begins within 200ms following flash exposure, with peak levels
gradually attained 1-2 seconds later.
FIGURE 5: Falling phase kinetics following flash photolysis of caged IPz. Following attainment
of peak cytosolic [Ca, fluorescence decays exponentially to resting levels. The solid line
represents actual fluorescence decay while the dashed line represents an exponential function
curve-fitted to the data.
FIGURE 6: Rising phase kinetics of [Cd in response to flash photolysis of caged IPz. Ca'
imaging was not documented for the initial 200ms following flash photolysis (time interval
indicated by vertical, dashed lines). The time to shutter reopening as well as the delay response of
the camera accounts for this delay period. Recording begins (*) when cytosolic Ca is already
near maximum, which is attained within 1 second following recording.
FIGURE 7: Average rising phase kinetics of Ca1 in response to flash photolysis of caged IPz.
An average kinetic response of cells (n-3) exposed to flash photolysis shows the 200ms blanking
of the recording (indicated by vertical, dashed lines), but a slightly longer time to peak [Ca (2-3
seconds) compared to the single cell response.
FIGURE 8: Latency following flash photolysis of IPz versus bradykinin stimulation. The solid
line represents a cell injected with caged IPz plus fluo-3 (ImM micropipette concentrations) and
stimulated by flash photolysis (indicated by drop in fluorescence). The dashed line represents the
same cell stimulated with a saturating concentration of bradykinin (100nM) moments later. Flash
photolysis of IPz results in a rise in [Ca within 200ms of uncaging. Stimulation with bradykinin
(time-O) results in a 5-7 second latency before Caâ€œ release in which cytosolic Ca does not
