(Fig. 9). Cells injected with caged IPz and exposed to flash photolysis, however, do not
propagate Ca“ waves (Fig. 10). The result indicates that the model's underlying assumption of a
wide cellular distribution of IPz receptors is correct. The result further suggests that Ca- waves
travel through this excitable IPz receptor rich medium.
Two mechanisms underlying the active wave propagation can be postulated. If IPz is
produced at the wave front, it can act to sustain propagation through activation of subsequent IPz
receptors down the length of the cell. Alternatively, if Ca" interacts with IPs receptors as the
model suggests, it can invoke a Ca“-induced Ca“ release at the wave front to sustain propagation
through the cell.
Future investigation
It has been suggested that IPz needs to reach sufficient threshold levels in order to activate
IPz receptors and subsequently cause Ca“ release into the cytosol (Parker, 1988). In order to
measure and quantify this hypothetical IPz threshold, continued experiments using flash photolysis
of lower concentrations of caged IPs need to be conducted. Furthermore, it would be equally
beneficial to stimulate cells with neurotransmitter, uncage IPz at varying intervals during the latent
period, and measure changes in latency to Ca“ release. Such studies could potentially determine
if it is [P itself which regulates and determines latency. In addition, other steps in the
phosphoinositide signaling pathway merit further investigation to determine their roles in the
latency to Ca“ release following neurotransmitter stimulation. Essential steps to investigate are
PIP2 hydrolysis, PLCBI activation, and Gyii turnover.
