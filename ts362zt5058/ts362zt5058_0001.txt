ABSTRACT
Stimulation of NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells with the neurotransmitter bradykinin
(Bk) leads to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IPz) production and calcium release from IPz-regulated
Ca“ pools located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This involves a specific G-protein second
messenger cascade. The release of intracellular Ca“ is preceded by a latent period of up to 30
seconds. This study investigated the contribution of IPz diffusion and the dynamics of IP;
receptor activation to the latency between surface receptor binding and Ca- release. Intracellular
injection of caged IPz plus the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 was used investigate the basis
of the observed latency. Following injection, cells were exposed to a brief (170us) flash of light
(230 joules, 360nm wavelength) to photolyse the caged compound. Fluorescence video imaging
was used to follow the change in intracellular [Ca. The study showed that [Ca begins to rise
immediately (within 200ms) following uncaging of IPz by flash photolysis, and reaches maximum
levels within 1.5 seconds. The result indicates that neither IPz diffusion to its receptors nor delay
between IP3R activation and Ca" release contribute significantly to overall latency. Analysis of
Ca“ wave kinetics shows that in contrast to cells stimulated with neurotransmitter, injected cells
do not exhibit propagation of Ca“ waves following photolysis of caged IPz. This observation
suggests that the IPz receptor is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the soma and major
neurites. Ca“ waves apparently travel through this IPz receptor rich medium. The constant rate
in which Ca“ waves travel shows that propagation is an active process rather than a diffusional
process. The mechanism of propagation could involve either IPz production or Ca"-induced Ca-
release at the wave front.
