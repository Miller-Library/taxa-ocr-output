Kinetics of rising phase following flash photolysis
Analysis of the response kinetics following flash photolysis reveals a 200ms period where
Ca“ imaging is not recorded (Fig. 6). The shutter reopening and delay associated with camera
response accounts for this lag period (see Materials and Methods). Recording begins within 1
second at which time [Ca are near peak levels. Thus, the initial rising phase following
photolysis is undocumented due to recording limitations. An average of response kinetics to
uncaging of IPz (Fig. 7) shows the same 200ms loss in imaging, but a slightly longer time interval
to peak [Ca of 2-3 seconds following uncaging.
Comparison of latency following agonist stimulation
A comparison of latencies to Ca“ release in the same neuronal cell following flash
photolysis of IPz and stimulation with bradykinin is shown in Fig. 8. Flash photolysis of IPz
results in a rise in intracellular [Ca within 200ms of uncaging. In contrast, stimulation with
bradykinin results in a latent period in which Ca" levels do not appreciably change, followed by a
rise in intracellular Ca“. Both responses are characterized by a falling phase where fluorescence
decreases either linearly (neurotransmitter) or decays exponentially (IPz) to resting levels.
Bradykinin stimulation elicits Ca wave propagation
The activation of the B2 receptor with agonist elicits a Ca- wave in a cell injected with
FFP-18. The Ca“ rise begins with a delay of 10-11 seconds after agonist application and spreads
across the cell as a defined wave-front. An example is shown in Fig. 9. The cell is stimulated
with bradykinin which invokes a Ca" wave beginning in the soma and spreading toward the
growth cone. A second wave originates in the growth cone and propagates toward the soma.
Wave speed is determined by measuring the time difference as a wave front passes two points in
