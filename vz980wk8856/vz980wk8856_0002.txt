Introduction
Much work has been done since the early nineteenth
century to establish trace metal concentrations in a variety
of biological systems, including marine organisms. For
example, J. F. John in 1814 demonstrated the presence of
manganese in the carapace of the marine crustacean Potamobius
fluviatilis. Within the last ten years, with the advent of
atomic absorption spectroscopy, much more rapid and relatively
more accurate investigation has been made possible. Most of
the work to date has been concerned with the establishment of
normal trace metal concentration levels within certain species
and is cited in Goldberg's 1967 review of the literature.
The goal of the work reported herein has been first
to catalog the concentrations of certain trace metals normally
occurring within the marine anamuran crustacean, Emerita
analoga, and second to attempt to analyze for differences
in metal concentrations possibly attributable to known point
sources of contamination. Therefore, a biogeographical survey
was accomplished with special note made of local contamination
inputs.
The Monterey Bay area was chosen for study, since it
has a large number of possible trace metal inputs: 6 direct
sewage outfalls (of primary or secondary treatment only); 6
rivers and sloughs, 3 of which traverse large agricultural
areas, and at least 2 of which are used for sewage disposal;
3 major fishing and boating centers; and 2 relatively large
urban areas, Santa Cruz and Monterey.
