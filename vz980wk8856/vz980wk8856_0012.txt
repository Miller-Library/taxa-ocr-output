reported to be found in very high concentrations in calcareous
tissues. In view of this, and noting the wide standard devia¬
tions exhibited, one may suspect that the molt state of the
animal may be a factor in the manganese concentrations. No
correlations with molt state of Emerita were performed.
Zinc is an element found in all organisms. It is a
component of many metalloenzymes and proteins, toxic at higher
levels in the environment. It has been found in marine or¬
ganisms at concentrations from 6 to 1500 ppm. Hiyama (Goldberg,
1967) found crustacea to have a concentration factor of well
over 500, indicating the zinc concentration in crustacea
should be over 5 ppm. The values reported herein ranged from
44 to 87 ppm. Not much deviation is seen in zinc concentra¬
tions. However, statistically differing concentration levels
were easily recognized; the highest concentrations being
found in Carmel Bay for which no explanation is drawn.
Noting that metals may act in a synergistic fashion
in either inhibition or activation of enzyme systems (Bowen,
1970), the relative concentration levels of metals were
plotted against each other for the area (Fig. 3). Actual
ppm figures are not comparable between the metals, but note
the relative levels found in the animals at the various lo¬
cations. The heights of the bars and the distinct hashing
types refer to the statistically differing ppm levels ex¬
pressed in Figure 2 for each metal.
Also in this diagram are recorded the levels found
in Emerita from Pt. Sur. for silver, manganese, chromium and
