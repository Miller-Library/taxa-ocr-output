Abstract
A survey was made of the concentrations of Ag, od,
Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn found in the sand crab, Emerita analoga,
and the sand it inhabits from various points in the Monterey
Bay area of California. Geographical differences in concen¬
trations were documented and correlations between these con¬
centration patterns and possible point sources of contaminant
input associated with domestic, industrial, and agricultural
effluents were drawn. In addition, the effect of local current
patterns in the concentration of various heavy metal pollutants
was suggested by the research.
The results suggest that Emerita may be a useful bio¬
geographical marker of trace metal levels in the sandy beach
environment.
