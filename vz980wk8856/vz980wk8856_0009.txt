Cadmium has been found in marine organisms at levels
from .15 to 3 ppm (Mullin and Riley, 1956). Again, no crus¬
tacean data is presented by Bowen (1970) for this element,
but Brooks and Rumsby (1965) report finding cadmium in the
proteins of certain molluscs. It has been found to be a
cumulative poison (Vinogradov, 1953) and Christian and Feldman
(1970) report that cadmium does inhibit certain enzymes. It
has been recorded occurring least in calcarious tissue of exo¬
skeleton, perhaps indicating that adsorption is not the major
factor in cadmium uptake. Figure 2b shows that the cadmium
concentrations found in Emerita fall in the range already
reported for marine organisms. Cadmium values were the highest
in the central Monterey Bay area, perhaps indicative of con¬
tamination from the Moss Landing or Salinas River area.
Tolan (1971) documented possible biological contamination
here in his finding of increased cadmium values in molluscs
and crustacean found in the Moss Landing area. It is interest¬
ing to note the higher values occur in the central area of
the Bay, an area more highly influenced by river and agri¬
cultural inputs and removed from the urban industrial and
domestic sewage outfalls.
Chromium is an essential element at trace levels.
It has been found to activate the enzyme phosphoglucomutase
(Strickland, 1949). However it is highly toxic at higher
levels. Bowen reports that Cr-IV is very much more toxic
than Cr-III, perhaps even carcinogenic. Chromium has been
documented in marine animals and occurs at concentrations of
126
