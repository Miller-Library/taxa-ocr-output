from 4-50 ppm; Culkino and Riley (Goldberg, 1967) cite a
value of 35.0 ppm in whole animal Cancer pagurus, another
decapod. The Emerita base line data (Fig. 2d) for copper,
reported here, is not higher than recorded elsewhere. It
is interesting to note the extremely high values recorded
at the Seaside and Fort Ord sewers which correlate directly
with Vieth's findings of high copper concentrations in the
actual effluents of the Seaside and Monterey sewage plants.
Noting the high values in the northern pocket of the
Bay, one is tempted to associate these increased copper
values with urban marine contamination taking place from the
major population centers at the north and south ends of the
Bay. Again we see relatively high values on the Monterey
Peninsula; perhaps indicative of either local current struc¬
ture or sewage contamination from Pacific Grove.
Man ganese is an essential element to physiological
functions. It has been found to be an enzyme activator for
many of the enzymes in the Krebs Cycle. It is also a con¬
stituent of many metalloenzymes found in the blood. It
competes with magnesium for position in certain other metal¬
loenzymes and thus, in higher concentrations, is an enzyme
inhibitor. Levels reported in the literature for marine
animals range from 1 to 60 ppm. The data presented in Figure
2 fall in this same range. Noting the lower solubility of
manganese in salt water over fresh water, it is interesting
to see that the highest Mn values found in Emerita were found
at each of the river inputs to the Bay. Manganese has been
