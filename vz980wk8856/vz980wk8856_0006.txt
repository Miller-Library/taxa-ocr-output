Eggs
Eggs were collected from the majority of the stations
sampled. The eggs collected were all under Stage 5 of de¬
velopment (Eickstadt, 1969). These were dried for 24 hours
at 80°C., and then weighed. The dried eggs were then sub¬
jected to basically the same wet digestion and atomic absorp¬
tion techniques outlined above for the whole animals with one
exception. Eggs had a higher proportional amount of lipid
per dry weight than whole animals. Consequently, several
extra steps of refluxing with both nitric acid and hydrogen
peroxide were needed. A blank was run concurrently to correct
for contamination by reagents and vessels. Only one analysis
could be made per station as a result of the very small dry
weight of eggs available. Thus there was no possibility for
statistical validation of the results obtained.
Sediments
Five sediment analyses were made per station; each
sample an aliquot of a test tube of sand collected at the
sand surface at each station. The wet digestion and atomic
absorption techniques described above were followed throughout.
The alternative of breaking down the sand granules themselves,
using hydrofluoric acid was rejected on both practical and
theoretical grounds. The crabs cannot be thought to be af¬
fected by the components of sand granules, nor can we expect
that the trace metal concentrations in these components are
substantially altered by trace metal contamination.
