zinc, the concentrations corresponded with the concentrations
in populations having relatively lower amounts of these metals.
However for copper, and more strikingly, in the case of cad¬
mium the values found at Pt. Sur are relatively high. The
extent to which this may be illustrative of natural variability,
contrary to contamination due to pollution factors, such as
a nearby naval facility, is unknown.
Figure 4 represents a geographical comparison of
metals found in the sediments along the coastline. Silver
and cadmium were not found in any of the sediments at a value
above the detection limit of the spectrophotometer. No sta¬
tistical correlation could be found between metals. However,
in scanning the data one may perceive a general correlation.
All four metals seem to concentrate in the Monterey basin
area (Stations 4 and 5). Also, the Salinas and Pajaro River
areas (Stations 10 and 15) seem to be areas of concentrations.
The hypothesis in this work has been that sand is very much
more transient than the animals studied. The values recorded
for metal concentrations in sediment may be illustrative then
of current patterns and sand shifting. Metal concentration
may be an effective means of cataloging sediment translocation.
By plotting dry weight against ppm found per animal,
no positive or negative correlation could be found with any
of the metals.
Several problems exist in expressing the egg data:
eggs were not found at all of the stations, there was much
