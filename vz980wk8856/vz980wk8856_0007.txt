Results and Discussion
The results have been expressed as ppm dry weight.
This was thought to be a more reliable figure than ppm wet
weight, as the variance of the water content per sample was
considerable. Based upon weight ratios, the ppm dry may
generally be converted to ppm wet weight using the wet to dry
ratio of 3.85 for animals and 1.26 for sediment. Wet weight
figures for the eggs were not obtained.
For each metal, the mean value in ppm for whole ani¬
mals and for sediments from each individual station was com¬
pared with that of every other station using the "student t"
test. On the basis of this data, signficantly differing
populations, based on statistically different concentration
levels, were recognized and cataloged. These differences are
displayed in Figure 2, a-f, through the use of different
hashing marks on the maps of the coastline of the Bay. Note
also that the mean values and standard deviations are re¬
corded to the left of each diagram.
The results obtained for concentrations found along
the coast will be discussed according to metal.
Silver (Fig. 2a) has been documented as occuring in
marine organisms at levels ranging from 3 to 11 ppm (Vinogradov,
1953), but Bowen (1966) lists no silver values as having been
recorded for crustacea. The data reported herein lies in the
range reported by Vinogradov showing a range of 1.4 to 4.2
ppm. According to Christian and Feldman (1970), silver is
an environmental contaminant and a cumulative poison, inhibiting
