Methods and Materials
Collection
The collection of Emerita from Monterey Bay was ac¬
complished during a five day period in late April 1971. The
aim was to collect all of the organisms over as short a time
span as possible to eliminate climatic and seasonal effects.
Twenty three stations from Carmel to Santa Cruz were sampled
(Fig. 1). Approximately 20 female Emerita analoga were taken
from each beach station. While in the field, the eggs were
separated from the ovigerous females and stored in separate
acid-cleaned containers. Sediment samples from the surface
of the sand were also taken from each of the twenty three
stations. The samples of whole animals, eggs, and sediments
were then frozen and stored until further use. In late May
another set of Emerita were collected from Pt. Sur, and area
believed to be relatively unpolluted, for comparison with the
established base line of metal concentrations in the Emerita
populations from around the Monterey Bay area.
Whole Animal Procedure
For each analysis, 5 to 8 animals per station were
thawed, blotted dry, and a fresh, wet weight was recorded.
The specimens were then dried at 80°C. for approximately 24
hours. A dry weight was recorded and each of the animals
was then crushed into a fine powder, using a mortar and
pestle (Thiers, 1957). Approximately 1/2 gram of this crushed
material was digested using a modification of the Middleton¬
