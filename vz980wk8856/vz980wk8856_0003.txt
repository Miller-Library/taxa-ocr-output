The metals chosen for study were silver, cadmium,
zinc, copper, manganese, and chromium. According to Bowen
(1966), all have either high or very high potential for
pollution. These metals are currently being introduced into
the environment at a rate exceeding their annual cycling out
of the marine environment. Furthermore, all, with the ex¬
ception of copper, are highly toxic at relatively low con¬
centrations. Thus a geographic survey of the concentrations
of these metals in a given species would seem to be of value
both in terms of assessing the possible biological impact of
point sources of contamination, and also in providing base¬
line data for an area expected to receive even higher inputs
of trace metals in the future.
The sand crab, Emerita analoga (Arthropoda, amomura)
was chosen primarily because of its ubiquity in the sandy
beaches which make up a major portion of the Monterey Bay
coastline. Furthermore, these animals do not move great
distances laterally (MacGinitie, 1938) and are thus potenti¬
ally good biological markers of local conditions. The study
was limited to females only as they are very much larger,
easier to collect, and may be individually analyzed for trace
metal content.
