enzymes in two ways. First, it competes with copper for
position in certain metalloenzymes, and second, it reacts
with thiol groups near enzymatic active sites, as does mercury.
Harvey (1968) asserts that the major input of silver into
biological systems is through adsorption, stating that silver
is not present as a salt in seawater. Thus adsorption and
food chain amplification may occur, and Emerita, found low on
the food chain (eating mostly plankton -- Efford, 1967) may
thus be expected to have relatively low values for this metal.
Referring to Figure 2a, we see the highest silver
content occurs at the southwestern tip of the Monterey
Peninsula. Peters (1971) in her study of metal concentra¬
tions in Pagurus samuelis also noted the highest silver con¬
centrations in this anomuran to be in populations from the
Monterey Peninsula, specifically from the area adjacent to
the Pacific Grove sewer outfall. According to Vieth (1971)
however, silver concentrations in the sewage effluent of
Pacific Grove are relatively low as compared with those values
found in the Monterey sewage effluent (under 5 ppm as compared
to 25 ppm). The high values represented at this area in
Emerita may be illustrative of current patterns which could
bring plankton from a relatively more contaminated area for
feeding or may merely represent some as yet unknown source of
input. Note however that the second most highly concentrated
area for silver was from the area near the Monterey sewer
effluent. The high levels seen in animals from the northern
tip of Monterey Bay near Santa Cruz remains unexplained.
