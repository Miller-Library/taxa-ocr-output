from .2 to 1 ppm (Bowen, 1970); Fukai and Fukai and Broquet
(Goldberg, 1967) documented chromium concentrations in
Eriphia verrucosa and Pisa nodipus, two crustacean of 1.1
and .48 ppm respectively. In Figure 2c it can be seen that
in only one location did my data correspond within one order
of magnitude to these figures. Error due to contamination of
vessels and reagents was at a minimum and corrections were
made by means of a blank, therefore, confidence may be placed
in this data. The high figures of 40 to 50 ppm found in the
Monterey Basin may be illustrative of pollution due to chro¬
mium boat paint used in the harbor, domestic sewage, or in¬
dustrial input into the Bay which congregates in the basin
to the southeast around the city of Monterey. The relatively
high levels found around the Asilomar-Pt. Pinos area may re¬
inforce the earlier contention that local current systems may
move pollutant from the basin around the point. In light of
the fact that Emerita from the southern tip of the Peninsula
were uncontaminated, these higher values probably represent
contamination from the Pacific Grove sewage effluent.
Copper is found in all animals. It is a component
of metalloenzymes: many having an oxidative role. It is
also a component of heamocyanin, the crustacean blood pigment.
It is, however, according to Bowen (1970), highly toxic at
relatively low levels. Major pollution sources are mining
operations, copper piping and fungicides in soil runoffs.
