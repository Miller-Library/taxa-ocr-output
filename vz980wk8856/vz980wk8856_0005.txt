Stuckey wet digestion method (Christian and Feldman, 1970)
suggested by Martin (personal communication). In this pro¬
cedure, 5 to 7 ml of 90% nitric acid is added to the crushed
material. This suspension is refluxed for approximately two
hours, allowed to evaporate to 2 ml, and then cooled. Approxi¬
mately 5 ml hydrogen peroxide is then added and the suspension
again heated, refluxed, boiled down and diluted to 25 ml with
distilled water. This was a most successful method for the
removal of the residual organic material in Emerita. Charring
was deemed both unnecessary and undesirable in light of pos¬
sible loss of volatile elements. There were noticeable amounts
of sand-like particles remaining, but these were assumed to
be unavoidable, recognizing the habitat and feeding patterns
of Emerita, and were merely allowed to settle out of suspen¬
sion. A blank solution was run under the same conditions to
account for any contamination of reagents and vessels. The
solutions were then analyzed by atomic absorption spectro¬
scopy for the trace metals listed above, using a Perkin-Elmer
model 303 Spectrophotometer (Kahn, 1968). The effect of
light scatter on the analyses of Cd and Zn was corrected for
by reading the absorption of each of the samples (2203 A°
and adding this value to the absorption recorded for the
blank run for each particular set. Data were calculated on
the basis of ug/gram, or parts per million, dry weight
(Christian and Feldman, 1970).
