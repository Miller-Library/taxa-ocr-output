3) In laboratory experiments in constant light, mysids
remained closely associated with kelp and almost
none moved away from kelp into adjacent open water.
4) In LD 14:10 in aquaria, significantly greater
numbers of mysids were observed in open water during
darkness than during light (PTT, p.05).
5) In DD A. sculpta exhibited an endogenous circadian
behavioral pattern of close association with kelp
during the subjective day and movement away from
kelp during the subjective night.
The nocturnal abundance of zooplankters and the
protection against predation which darkness affords
probably combine to make A. sculpta's nighttime
movement away from kelp highly adaptive behavior.
