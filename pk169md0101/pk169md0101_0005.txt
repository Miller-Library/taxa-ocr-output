population detected in open water.
In the DD experiments, peak numbers of mysids in
the open water were detected during the subjective
night (Figures 3 and 4). In the first DD experiment
this pattern persisted for about one week, though the
peak values diminished. Since 92% of the mysids
survived the first DD experiment, the decline was
probably not a function of loss of animals. The mean
night value was significantly greater than the mean day
value for diel periods in all DD experiments (PTT, po.05
).
Discussion
Both laboratory and field results suggest that A.
sculpta remains closely associated with blades of
Macrocystis during the day but does not maintain this
close relationship with kelp at night. Daytime
observations made while snorkeling in the kelp canopy
and the adjacent open water corroborate these results
with the added information that the mysids are so
cryptic in both behavior and coloration that they are
seldom seen. The mysids which were observed, however,
were intimately associated with kelp.
In the rowboat study, the fact that the nighttime
peak value for the number of mysids detected in open
water is significantly greater than the daytime values
(x* Combined, p.05) suggests movement away from kelp
