fixed buoy 50M from the edge of the Station's south
kelp forest and in an adjacent sand channel. Surface
tows with a 333um mesh zooplankton net, O.5M in
diameter, were made through the canopy and in open
water 10-20M from the kelp bed. A rowboat was used to
tow the net in one study and skin divers towed it in
another. The mysids collected were placed in aquaria
with running sea water. Half of each aquarium
contained suspended blades of Macrocystis pyrifera
while half consisted of an open water section. Three
light regimes were used: 1) a light-dark cycle of
14:10 (LD 14:10), 2) constant light (LL), and 3) constant
dark (DD). Light intensity near the surface of the
open water was 10-20 footcandles in all lighted aquaria.
On a sunny day light intensity near the surface of open
water in the field was slightly greater than that used
in the laboratory. Aquaria contained either 100 or
200 mysids and the number of animals in the open water
was counted at two-hour intervals. A dim flashlight
shaded with red cellophane was used to take readings in
darkness as preliminary studies showed its effect on
the mysids to be minimal.
Results
In all field studies and preliminary field work,
virtually no mysids were found in open water during the
day but some were found in open water at night (Figure
