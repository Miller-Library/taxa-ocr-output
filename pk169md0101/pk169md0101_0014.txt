% Total Population Observed in Open Water (LD and LL)
Versus Time
The % of the total mysid population observed in
open water in aquaria (as opposed to a section of each
aquarium which contained kelp) is graphed versus time
for separate studies which used different light regimes.
In the light-dark (LD) experiment a 14:10 cycle was used
and one tank was lit with natural light which diffused
through a laboratory skylight while another tank was lit
artificially. In the graph of constant light (LL)
experimental results vertical bars denote standard error.
All LD and LL aquaria contained 100 mysids and were
exposed to a light intensity of 10-20 footcandles.
