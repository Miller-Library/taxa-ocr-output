the canopy where its behavior and cryptic coloration
render it inconspicuous. Concealment is essential for
its survival, since many species of fish prey upon it
(Clarke, 1971).
Its complex forward appendages enable it to
filter feed on phytoplankton and other particulates
(Banner, 1948; Tattersall, 1951). It is also known to
consume pieces of kelp and to prey on zooplankters such
as copepods (Hobson, 1976).
There is evidence that A. sculpta does not always
maintain close association with kelp since it was found
in plankton tows through open water adjacent to kelp
forests (Hobson, 1976; Miller, 1976). During
preliminary studies I became interested in the suggested
horizontal migration of A. sculpa, and I undertook this
research to investigate a possible diel pattern of
close daytime association with the kelp canopy
followed by movement away from kelp at night. As well
as field studies, I carried out laboratory experiments
in aquaria where the habitat was simulated in miniature
and stocked with mysids.
