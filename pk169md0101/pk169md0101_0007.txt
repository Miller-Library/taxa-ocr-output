An interesting and unexpected result obtained
from the DD experiments was the existence of an
endogenous rhythm of association with kelp during the
subjective day and movement to the adjacent open water
during the subjective night. For a small animal, which
may have to move some distance to reach the protection
of kelp before daylight subjects it to diurnal or
crepuscular predatory fishes, the ability to anticipate
dawn provided by an endogenous clock would be essential.
If any compass orientation is required to home back to
the kelp canopy a clock is again necessary to account
for movement of celestial objects used as navigational
cues.
Many intriguing aspects of this patterned
behavior remain to be examined. Characterization of the
behavior in the field is only fragmentary and
suggestive. Properties of the biological clock such as
its free running period and Zeitgeber also provide a
fertile area for further investigations.
Summary
1) Field observations showed that A. sculpta remains
close to kelp blades in the Macrocystis canopy
during the day.
2) A. sculpta was detected in open water adjacent to
the kelp forest at night but virtually never during
the day.
