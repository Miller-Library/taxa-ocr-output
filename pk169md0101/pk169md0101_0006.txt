at night. Taken in the context of Hobson's (1976) and
Miller's (1976) work together with preliminary studies,
all of which showed an increase in the number of mysids
detected in open water at night over daytime values,
these results suggest a behavioral pattern which
lates to laboratory findings.
These results do not necessarily show mass
movement from the kelp bed across long distances to
open water. It is possible A. sculpta comes out of
hiding among kelp blades and swims in water immediately
adjacent to them. Perhaps only some of these mysids
move far enough away from kelp to be taken in plankton
tows 10-20M off the canopy. A better method of
demonstrating this behavior may be to dip net in open
spaces in the canopy during the diel cycle.
Possible advantages for a behavioral pattern of
nocturnal movement away from kelp were not examined in
this research, but previous work gives grounds for
speculation. Hobson (1976) shows that A. scupta's
consumption of copepods increases at night over the
amount consumed during the day. In addition, the
number of copepods and other zooplankters present in
the water column is known to be greater at night than
during the day (Hobson, 1976). This abundant food
source and the protection against predation which the
darkness provides probably combine to make A. scupta's
behavioral pattern highly adaptive.
