% Total Population in Open Water (DD EXPS. 2 and 3)
Versus Time
The % of the total mysid population observed in
open water in aquaria (as opposed to a section of each
aquarium which contained kelp) is graphed versus time for
two constant dark (DD) experiments. In experiment 2 there
were 200 mysids/replicate while in experiment 3 there
were 100 mysids/replicate. Three replicates were used
in both experiments. Vertical bars denote standard error.
