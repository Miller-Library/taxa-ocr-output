% Total Fopulation in Open Water (DD EXP. 1)
Versus Time
The % of the total mysid population observed in
open water in aquaria (as opposed to a section of each
aquarium which contained kelp) is graphed versus time
for three replicate tanks which each contained 100
mysids and were exposed to constant darkness (DD).
Vertical bars denote standard error.
