Figure 1
Mysids Observed/Zooplankton Sample versus Time
The mean number of mysids detected in three
replicate surface tows of a 333um mesh zooplankton net,
0.5M in diameter is graphed versus time for two
different studies. In the rowboat study each tow lasted
three minutes and tows were made only in open water 10-
20M from the kelp forest (boxed points). In the diver
study, 50M tows were made through the kelp canopy (points
which are not boxed) as well as through the open water.
Vertical bars indicate standard error.
