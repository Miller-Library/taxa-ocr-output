Abstract
The mysid shrimp A. sculpta was observed to
associate closely with the kelp canopy of Macrocystis
beds during the day. At night but almost never during
the day, it was found in plankton tows through open
water adjacent to the kelp forest, suggesting nocturnal
movement away from kelp.
In constant light A.sculpta remained closely
associated with kelp in aquaria and virtually never
moved into adjacent open water. When subjected to a
light-dark 14:10 regime which coincided with day and
night, more mysids moved away from kelp at night than
during the day. In constant darkness A. sculpta showed
an endogenous circadian behavioral pattern of close
association with kelp during the subjective day and
movement away from kelp during the subjective night.
This behavior is discussed in terms of possible
selective advantages, such as avoidance of predation
and feeding on zooplankters which are present in the
water column at night.
Introduction
A. sculpta is a mysid shrimp, about lem long,
which inhabits the kelp canopy of Macrocystis beds in
California. Limbaugh (1955) and Clarke (1971) observed
this crustacean in the southern part of its range.
They found it associates closely with kelp blades in
