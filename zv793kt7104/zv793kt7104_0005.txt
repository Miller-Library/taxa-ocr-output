was accelerated gradually to ten cycles per minute. After 30
minutes the radial distribution of each population was recorded.
A minute of manual surge separated each reading, to prevent unre¬
corded populations from shifting. After 30 minutes calm, distri¬
butions were recorded again.
Response to Exposure: Finally, exposure was tested in the
laboratory for its effect on radial distributions of Tricolia
pulloides populations. In order to simulate the natural tidal
cycle, a clock was positioned above an aquarium, with the aquarium
drain hose attached by string to the hour hand of the clock. As
the hour hand made a revolution every 12 hours, the drain hose, and
hence aquarium water level, rose and fell. Thus algae gradually
were exposed and submerged twice daily.
On 1 June three pairs of algae were collected from the field,
cleared of biota, and anchored in clay. One pair was placed on the
aquarium floor, one pair on a brick, and one pair on two bricks in
the aquarium. At 1700 each pair was stocked with 50 snails collected
the previous day. Algae were submerged completely, in synchrony
with the high tide at 1711. Populations were allowed to equilibrate
until 1800, at which time radial distributions were recorded.
Observations were made under constant light every two hours, through
two high and low tides.
Statistical Analyses
Row-by-column contingency tests (Zar,1974) were performed on
