INTRODUCTION
Tricolia pulloides is an abundant intertidal prosobranch
gastropod inhabiting many algae of the mid-intertidal zone. In
the area studied around Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford Univer-
sity, Pacific Grove, California, most T. pulloides inhabit the
abundant red alga, Gigartina papillata. Combined abundances of
organism and habitat provide ample opportunity for the study of
T. pulloides and its exploitation of various microhabitats within
G. papillata.
Goals of this study were: 1) to determine changes in distri¬
butions of populations of Tricolia pulloides on Gigartina papillata
during changing conditions of light, surge, and exposure in the
field; 2) to examine isolated responses to changes in each physical
factor in the laboratory; 3) to explain observed field and labora¬
tory behavior in terms of avoidance of possible stresses brought
on by these changing physical factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Field Study
Investigation of Tricolia pulloides' behavior began with an
intensive field study of populations inhabiting pairs of algae at
1.6 m, 1. 8 m, and 2.0 m above mean lower low tide. Distributions
of these populations were observed every 2-3 hours through one
complete tidal cycle beginning at 1800 on 2 May.
