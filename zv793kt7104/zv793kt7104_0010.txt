Figure 3: Distribution of Tricolia pulloides populations around
walls of clear jars after 30 minutes in sunlight. Total
numbers of snails per experiment indicated in parentheses.
Thicknesses of sectors are proportional to numbers of
snails on jar walls in each of eight 45° sectors. Sig¬
nificance level (p value) for night experiment is from
a chi-square test comparing this distribution to an even
distribution. Significance levels (p values) for morning,
afternoon, and evening experiments are from an RxC con¬
tingency test (Zar, 1974) performed to determine if
snail distributions around jar walls were contingent
upon directional sunlight. North indicated by arrow
labeled N. Direction of incident sunlight shown by
unmarked arrows.
Figure 4: Summed radial distributions of 100 Tricolia pulloides
on Gigartina papillata after 60 minutes calm, 30 minutes
manual surge, and 30 minutes calm on three consecutive
days. Upper, middle, and lower sections of histograms
represent, respectively, outer, middle, and inner algal
regions. Widths of histogram sections are proportional
to numbers of snails in appropriate regions of the 5
algae. Actual numbers enclosed in appropriate sections.
Significance levels (p values) are for RxC contingency
tests (Zar, 1974) performed to determine if radial
