Algae were upright, 3-5 cm high, located on a sloping granite
face with no adjacent algal cover or sediment. Waves rarely broke
on the area, but there was strong surge at times. Each alga was
inhabited by 20-50 snails. These populations were supplemented
by approximately 20% to amplify distributional shifts. Population
densities remained within reasonable limits, however; many other
algae the same size were inhabited by nearly a hundred snails.
Distributions of Tricolia pulloides within Gigartina papillata
in the field and laboratory were quantified by subdividing the alga
into three regions: 1) outer region, comprised of all broad, thin,
leafy frond ends beyond at least one major branch point; 2) inner
region, comprised of granite substratum immediately beneath the
alga and thick, narrow frond stems up to the first major branch
point; 3) middle region, comprised of all remaining frond area.
Radial distributions of populations in all experiments were charac¬
terized by recording the number of snails in each of these areas.
In the field study, exact counts were obtained of the number of
snails in outer and inner regions. Numbers for middle regions,
however, were estimated. The difficulty of gently searching through
an alga with fine forceps while on SCUBA during strong surge made
exact counts of larger middle populations virtually impossible.
All other counts were exact.
Several distinct changes in distributions of Tricolia pulloides
populations were observed during the field study. However, environ¬
mental factors, particularly light, surge, and exposure, were
