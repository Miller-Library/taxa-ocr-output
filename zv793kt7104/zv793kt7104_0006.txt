most data. Outer, middle, and inner regions or lit and shaded sides
were rows. Levels of physical factors were columns. Thus
RxC tests indicated levels at which distributions, rows, were con¬
tingent upon levels of physical factors,columns. A chi-square test
(Zar,1974) was used to compare distribution around jar wall for the
dark experiment to an even distribution.
RESULTS
Field Study
Radial distributions recorded during field studies are shown
in Figure 1. An RxC test was performed on data for submerged
populations with subjective estimates of surge levels, calm, mod¬
erate, and rough, as columns. Radial distributions, rows, were
contingent upon surge levels (p £ 0.001). An RxC analysis of inner
and outer data, eliminating estimates of numbers of snails in
middle regions, also indicated radial distributions were contingent
upon surge levels (p + 0.001).
An RxC test also was performed on all field data, with exposed
and submerged as columns (see Figure 1). Radial distributions,
rows, were contingent upon presence of water (p £ 0.001). Elimination
of estimates of populations in middle regions produced similar
results (p « 0.001).
