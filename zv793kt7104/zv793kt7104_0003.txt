fluctuating concurrently, so that distributional shifts could not
be attributed conclusively to changes in any single environmental
factor. Controlled laboratory experiments were necessary to deter¬
mine important environmental parameters and their effects on radial
distributions of T. pulloides populations.
Laboratory Experiments
Response to Light: Initial laboratory experiments tested for
a response by Tricolia pulloides on Gigartina papillata to light
from above and from the side. In this and other laboratory experi¬
ments, snails were collected from the field, marked with silver
nail polish, with no apparent detrimental effects, and submerged
in 13°C sea water with G. papillata for 24 hours prior to the
experiment. Four algae, similar to those chosen for the field
study, were collected from the field complete with granite chip
and holdfast. The algae were cleared of biota, anchored in model¬
ling clay, submerged, and stocked with 25 T. pulloides. Each
system of four algae and 100 gastropods was equilibrated in darkness.
After sixty minutes, numbers of T. pulloides on sides of fronds to
be illuminated were counted under dim red light. Thirty watt
microscope lamps, positioned 10 cm above one system and 10 cm to
the side of the other, were turned on. Numbers of T. pulloides on
lit sides of fronds were recorded at thirty minute intervals. The
vertical experiment was terminated after 60 minutes. The lateral
experiment was terminated after 150 minutes.
