Because no significant phototactic response was detected during
the laterally-lit experiment, despite a significant downward popu¬
lation shift in the vertically-lit experiment (see RESULTS), a
second laterally-lit phototaxis experiment was conducted, in an
artificial environment. At approximately 1100, 1300, 1900, and
2300 on 1 June, roughly 100 snails were submerged in clear plastic
jars filled with sea water. Jars were placed on a lab bench two
meters from a window. The water was swirled until Tricolia pulloides
were scattered about the jar bottoms. After 30 minutes approximately
80% of the gastropods had climbed or were climbing the jar walls.
Paper divided into eight sectors of 45° each was taped around the
jars. Numbers of gastropods on the jar walls in each sector was
recorded.
Response to Surge: Tricolia pulloides'response to surge also
was tested in the laboratory. Surge was simulated by shuttling a
plywood board attached to PVC pipe back and forth in an aquarium
filled with 13°C sea water.
On 21,22, and 23 May, five algae were collected from the field,
cleared of biota, anchored in modelling clay, and tacked upright
to the aquarium floor. One hundred Tricolia pulloides collected
and marked the previous day were placed on the submerged algae.-
After 120 minutes equilibration in calm water, radial distribution
of T. pulloides on each alga was recorded. The plywood board,
which extended about halfway down the water column, was moved back
and forth across the entire length of the aquarium. Manual surge
