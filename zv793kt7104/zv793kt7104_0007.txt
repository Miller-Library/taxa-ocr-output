columns indicated radial distributions were independent of prior
surge on 23 May (p » 0.25). On 22 May, though, distributions were
contingent upon prior surge (p £ 0.025). However, it appears that
atypical initial distribtuions on 22 May might have been the source
of unexpected difference between initial and final distributions.
Response to Exposure: Radial distributions for the exposure :
experiments are presented in Figure 5. RxC tests with exposed and
submerged as columns indicated radial distributions were contingent
upon submersion (p £ 0.001). Interestingly, when data for the one
alga which did not remain upright upon exposure is discarded, the
G value nearly doubles (21.3 vs. 38). Qualitative observation
showed gastropods on this alga moved inward to a lesser extent when
exposed than did gastropods on those algae which remained upright.
DISCUSSION
In all experiments, Tricolia pulloides populations shifted to
outer regions of Gigartina papillata during optimum conditions of
calm submersion in dim light. Mooers (1979) has shown diatoms to
be T. pulloides' principal food item, and Chun (1979) has shown
that diatoms and T. pulloides' grazing tracks are found almost en¬
tirely on outer regions of a similar red alga, Rhodoglossum affine
Thus, under optimum conditions, T. pulloides populations may move
to outer areas of G. papillata to feed.
Desiccation is a considerable threat to Tricolia pulloides:
an 1D50 of 18 hours was reported for laboratory exposure
