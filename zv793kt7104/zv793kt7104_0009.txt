Figure 1: Radial distributions of approximately 150 Tricolia
pulloides on 3 pairs of Gigartina papillata at different
tidal heights. Upper, middle, and lower sections of
histograms represent, respectively, outer, middle, and
inner algal r√©gions. Widths of histogram sections are
proportional to numbers of snails in appropriate regions
of algae. Approximate total number of snails observed
per reading shown below. Populations above dashed line
were exposed when observed. Populations below dashed
line were submerged when observed. Time line shown,
black bar indicates darkness.
Figure 2: Summed distributions of 100 Tricolia pulloides on lit
side, clear bar, and shaded side, hatched bar, of fronds
of four Gigartina papillata before and after exposure to
light from above and from the side. Sizes of clear and
hatched areas are proportional, respectively, to numbers
of snails on lit and shaded sides of fronds. Exact
numbers enclosed. Significance levels (p values) are
from RxC contingency tests (Zar,1974) performed to
determine if snail distributions are independent of
lighting.
