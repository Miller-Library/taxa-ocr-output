distributions were contingent upon manual surge.
Figure 5: Radial distributions of 150 Tricolia pulloides on three
pairs of Gigartinä papillata during a 24 hour simulated
tide cycle. Upper, middle, and lower sections of histo¬
grams correspond, respectively, to outer, middle, and
inner regions of pairs of algae placed at high, medium,
and low levels in an aquarium. Nidths of histogram
sections are proportional to summed numbers of snails
in appropriate regions of the 3 pairs of algae. Actual
numbers enclosed in appropriate sections. Populations
above dashed line were exposed when observed. Populations
below dashed line were submerged when observed. Time
line and date shown below.
