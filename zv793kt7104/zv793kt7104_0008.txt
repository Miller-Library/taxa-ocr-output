(Firestone, 1979), and may be considerably less in bright sunlight.
Thus, negative phototaxis seen in natural and artificial surroundÂ¬
ings would seem an adaptive response. The sensitivity of this
response is indicated by jar experiments: areas of highest snail
density on jar walls shifted east as areas of incident sunlight
shifted west during the day (see Figure 3). Similarly, T. pulloides
response to exposure seen both in the field and the laboratory would
minimize the period in which the snail is entirely without moisture
and subject to eyaporative water loss.
Inward movement of Tricolia pulloides during strong surge
minimizes the threat of being swept off the alga, since inner regions
swing through a smaller arc and with less tangential velocity than
frond ends. During trial surge experiments snails on outer areas
of algae often were swept off if strong manual surge was begun
suddenly. Thus, inward movement of T. pulloides populations during
surge also appears to be an adaptive response.
