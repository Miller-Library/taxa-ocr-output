SUB!
TIDAL SURVEY OF THE PAGURID POPULATION
Hopkins Marine Station
Robert T. Cook
15/8/6
Introduction
A survey was taken of the pagurid populatien in the
subtidal area in conjunction with the intertidal survey
done by Bob Belknap. I hoped to find the types and numbers
of pagurids found in the subtidal region, and also the
substrates on which the pagurids are found.
Procedure
The procedure followed was that of the intertidal
survey except that all samples were colledted by scooping
up sand with plastic collecting boxes, or by scraping
in the substrate with a diving knife.
Due to the prevalence of a <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus : Exact'>Pagurus</span> species not found
in the intertidal area, a pigmentation chart (See Fig. 1 &
2) was constructed for identifying P. (setosus)" to use
along with John Markhame Pigmentation Chart which I used
for identification of juvenile hermit crabs.
Nine collecting areas were marked out in the subtidal
region. Within each area four substrates were sampled--
open sand, large rocks, crevices found between large rocks,
and small rocks or gravel.
The species name is not known The name in
parenthesis is a closely related species used
as a means of distinguishing the unknown species
of pagurids.

Results
Three intertidal species of hermit crabs were found
in the subtidal area: <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus hemphilli : Exact'>Pagurus hemphilli,</span> <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. hirsutiusculus,</span>
and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. granosimanus.</span> Two other distinct species of Pagurus
were found in the subtidal, but they have yet to be identified.
Using Schmitt's "Key To California Species of Pagurus,
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pylopagurus : Exact'>Pylopagurus,</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Parapagurus : Exact'>Parapagurus"</span> the two unknowns fit closely
the characteristics for <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus setosus : Exact'>Pagurus setosus</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. californiensis.</span>
However examination of the species description eliminates
the possibility that these are the correct specific names.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Paguristes turgidus : Exact'>Paguristes turgidus</span> and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. bakeri</span> were found in the
deeper part of the sampled area in the subtidal region.
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Pagurid glaucothoe</span> residing in shells were found in all
sampled areas. (Bee Fig. 4.)
Pagurus hemphilli and P. (setosus) constituted over
90% of the sampled pagurid population. The former being
more prevalent nearer the intertidal while the latter
was more numerous in the deeper waters. (See Fig. 5.)
Juvenile pagurids always constituted the majority of
the hermit crabs sampled in each area. (See Fig. 6.)
Although hermit crabs were found just about everywhere
in the subtidal, coralline algae proved to be the substrate
on which the paguries concentrated. (See Fig. 7.)

Discussion
Pagurus hemphilli, which was found by Belknap to
be prevalent in the lower intertidal area, was also very
prevalent throughout the subtidal area. P. hirsutiusculus,
which was numerous throughout the whole intertidal area,
was not found to any great extent in any part of the
subtidal area. This could be indicative of a sudden drop
in population at the intertidal zone or of poor sampling
in one of the surveys.
P. (setosus), which I found throughout the subtidal
area, was not found in the intertidal area by Belknap,
perhaps because it was not recognized (it resembles P.
hirsutiusculus).
Summary
1. Pagurus hemphilli, P. hirsutiusculus, P. granosimanus,
P. (setosus). and P. (californiensis) were found inhabiting
the subtidal region.
2. Paguristes bakeri and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. turgidus</span> were found in
the subtidal region.
3. Large numbers of pagurid glaucothoe were found residing
in shells.
4. Coralline algae is the substrate having the highest
population density of pagurids.
