slime, their presence would not invalidate the results.
However, where slime covers the algae there may be
a decreased productivity due to reduction of incident
light (L. R. Blinks, personal communication).
Other experimental parameters may cause erroneous
results. Incident sunlight was used as the light
source for incubation. Tests run at different times
of day would necessarily produce inconsistencies
in this parameter. "The effect of production of a
given quantity of algae varies from hour to hour.
It may be reduced both by increase and decrease of
the light intensity to which the species are adapted.
Therefore, the assimilation rate oscillates according
to time of day as well as to weather" (Findenegg, 1964).
The portion of the algae used for the testing also
may produce large variation in the results, even if
care is taken to select opposing branches of like
size from the same portion of the plant (James
Schreiber, personal communication).
There are many factors which affect the light
and dark bottle method of algal productivity measurements.
The data suggests that there are definite effects
occurring on the productivity of P. lanceolata at
the outfall; a larger sample size would introduce
more certainty into the results. The results presented
in this paper and their significance should be accepted
with caution, until more evidence is presented.
