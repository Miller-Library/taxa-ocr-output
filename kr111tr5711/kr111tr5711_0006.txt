RESULTS
The gross productivity and net productivity of
Prionitis lanceolata showed changes with increasing
distance from the outfall (figures 6, 7). These changes
coincide fairly well with one another, the net
productivity showing less erratic behavior, and thus
possibly being a better measure of the true productivity.
The results were also plotted as a function of the
visual dispersion of the effluent (dye studies).
This curve shows the same trend as the others, but
is probably the best interpretation of the data,
since it most closely illustrates the actual effects
of the effluent at the outfall. The results indicate
an increased productivity rate at the outfall,
followed by a decline in this rate a short distance
away. The productivity is again elevated 20-40 meters
from the outfall, decreasing to a low at approximately
70 meters. Beyond this distance, values to the south
of the outfall are greater than those found for the
algae which lie to the north of the outfall and for
the HMS control. This trend correlates with the
currents found in the bay (figures 3, 4).
