ABSTRACT
BACHELOR, E. P. (Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford
University, Pacific Grove, California), A Comparative
Study of the Productivity of Prionitis lanceolata
Harvey Near and Away from the Carmel Marine Sewage
Outfall.
The benthic red alga Prionitis lanceolata
Harvey shows an increased primary productivity in
the outfall canyon of the Carmel, California, marine
sewage outfall. At a distance of twenty meters from
the outfall this productivity shows a large reduction
before again rising to a high value at approximately
20 to 40 meters. The differing productivities of
samples from Mission Point, Monastery Beach, and
Cabrillo Point (Hopkins Marine Station) are compared
in relation to the currents which were found. Possible
causes for these differences in productivity are
discussed. The validity of the "light and dark bottle
method of benthic algal productivity measurement
used here is also discussed.
