DISCUSSION
The pigment content per gram wet weight of
Prionitis lanceolata has been shown to be at high
levels in samples from very near sewage outfalls,
and to decrease to a much lower value a short distance
away (10-20 meters). This pigmentation rises to
a normal value at a greater distance from the outfall
(40-120 meters) (Peter Roy, personal communication).
The increased pigmentation of the algae found in
closest proximity to the outfall may not, however
cause the increase in productivity seen experimentally
(figures 6, 7) when the algae remain in the outfall
environment. The alga in its natural environment
may be affected by increased growth of epiphytic
diatomaceous slime, turbidity, and other factors
introduced by the effluent such as changes in temperature,
salinity, and pH. The extra pigmentation in the
outfall canyon samples may be an adaptation which
suffices only to raise the production to a level
close to that of other "unpolluted" members of the
same species. Conversely, the increased pigmentation
may actually cause an elevated productivity at the
outfall.
A profitable continuation of this experiment
