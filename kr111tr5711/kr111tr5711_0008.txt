would be firstly, to test unwashed algae from the
outfall canyon in its environmental water, rather
than introducing this alga, scrubbed, into fresh
sea water. This would give a truer indication of
the productivity of the alga under those environmental
conditions present. Secondly, to test for productivity
changes versus the pigment content of the alga, which
should seemingly have a large effect on the productivity.
Increased amounts of nutrients introduced into
the area via the outfall may account for the increases
in productivity found at greater distances (20-120
meter radius), where pigmentation might be at a normal
level. Currents in the bay move predominantly to
the south from the outfall (figure 3), thus, increase
in nutrients with some dilution may also account
for the greater productivity found at Monastery Beach
compared to those found for the algae at Mission
Point to the north and the HMS control.
The validity of the experimental procedure used
here for the benthic marine algae may be doubtful.
During incubation air bubbles tended to accumulate
on the surface of many of the algal samples. These
bubbles did not dissolve into solution. These bubbles
may have been 0, produced by the algal sample, and
an error is present in the results found since true
production was not measured. This error is probably
about 3%. If the bubbles were produced by an epiphytic
