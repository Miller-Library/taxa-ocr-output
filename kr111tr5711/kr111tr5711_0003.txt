MATERTALS AND METHODS
Knowledge of the dispersion behavior of the
sewage was important to both the collection of
samples and the interpretation of experimental results;
therefore, two group projects were completed during
the term of study. First, a map of the immediate
outfall area was constructed through the use of
compass readings and measured lines. This map was
marked in a grid with squares proportional to 625 ft
of area. Each of these squares was in turn divided
into 25 squares, each with sides proportional to
five feet. This gridded map (figure 1) greatly
aided in location and identification of algal samples.
A map of the entire Carmel Bay area, partially
represented in figures 3, 4, was obtained from the
California State Department of Beaches and Parks.
Second, two current studies were undertaken
using fluorescein dye and color coded, marked bottles.
The bottles were set from a small skiff in predetermined
lines, and compass readings (figure 2, tables I, II)
made at timed intervals from a suitable reference
point. The bottles' actions were then plotted using
this information (figures 3, 4). The dye was made
up into 40 gm packets, containing a 3"x 3" x Â½
