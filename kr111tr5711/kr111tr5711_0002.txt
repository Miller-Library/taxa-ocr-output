INTRODUCTION
Prionitis lanceolata Harvey is a species of
benthic red algae which is widely distributed in
the Monterey Bay, California, intertidal regions,
generally occurring in the +1.0 to -1.5 foot tide
levels. This alga has been found in very close
proximity to the marine sewage outfalls of Carmel
and Pacific Grove, and for this reason was chosen
as an experimental tool of marine sewage pollution
study. The increasing problems of waste disposal
in the bay area have made change mandatory; the
need for a good indicator of sewage pollution has
become increasingly necessary, so that intelligent,
ecologically acceptable decisions may be made
concerning the future of the marine sewage outfalls.
This paper presents the results of primary
productivity measurements of P. lanceolata samples
collected near and away from the outfall. Some
hypotheses are made with respect totthe sewage's
effect on the primary productivity. The "light and
dark bottle" method of algal productivity measurement
as used here, was found to not be especially applicable
when applied to benthic marine algae. Therefore,
the significance of the results should be accepted cautiously.
