through it for approximately ten to fifteen minutes.
A pump system was devised which allowed this water
to be transfered to the bottles from the carboy using
the Nitrogen as the pumping source. Thus, only a
minimal uptake of atmospheric oxygen by the water was
allowed. The aeration by Nitrogen lowered and standardized
the ambient dissolved oxygen in the sea water appreciably.
The B.O.D. bottles were then sealed, their stoppers
taped in place, and incubated for one hour in the
holding tanks (depth - +1.5 ft, temperature - 11Â°c).
At the end of the incubation the bottles were removed,
the dissolved 0, "fixed" (Strickland and Parsons,
1965), and a 50 ml volume removed from each bottle
for the standard Winkler titration (Strickland and
Parsons, 1965). Two "initial bottles" containing
only the aerated sea water were fixed using the same
procedure and also titrated. Test time, duration
of test, ambient conditions (e.g., sunny), and the
titration results were noted on a test data sheet
(appendix). The algae were removed from the bottles,
placed on filter paper, and dried in an oven. After
being allowed to cool in contact with the air, the
algal samples were weighed individually. Calculations
of the gross productivity, net productivity, and
respiration were made using modified formulas from
Strickland and Parsons (1965).
