piece of plywood as a floating device, and used to
mark the bottle drops from the skiff and to conduct
microcurrent studies in the immediate area of the
outfall (figure 5).
Collection of sample:
Prionitis lanceolata was collected, labeled
with the collection site sample number (e.g., 50-b),
and placed in plastic bags for transport to the lab.
The location, time of collection, tidal conditions,
and a description of the algae and the collection
site were all noted on a collection sheet (appendix).
If the alga was to be used at a later time it was
stored in Dr. L. R. Blinks' greenhouse aquaria.
Experimental procedure
Before testing, algal samples were scrubbed
with fresh sea water to remove as many of the
epiphytes and epizoites as possible. Algal
sections of approximately the same size, and from
the same part of the plant, were cut and placed into
the clear and opaque B.O.D. bottles. After the
volumes of the bottles were measured, the bottles
were filled with sea water which had had No gas bubbled
