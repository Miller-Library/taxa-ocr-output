INTRODUCTION
An easily overlooked fact is that the algae seen growing along
coastal boundaries have not always existed in their macroscopic adult
forms, but begin their life cycles as spores. When considering the
distribution of an alga it is common to observe the effects of environmental
stresses on adult plants. What is seldom considered is the possibility
that macroalgal distribution may be just as much a function of the early
activity of the plant (that is, while it is a spore or sporeling) as it
is a function of the activity of the adult plant.
Red algal spores are purportedly non-motile. They enter the water
column often by forcible ejection from the cystocarp and are carried along
by water currents, which have been shown to be far more of an influence
on their distribution than any sinking due to gravity effects (Coon, et. al.,
1971). Where spores settle, how fast they settle, and how well the grow
where they settle could possibly have broad influences on the distribution
of a given species in the field. McLachlan (1974) suggests that distriÂ¬
bution of Fucus in nature is largely controlled by factors acting on the
embryo and that responses of the embryo may be different than those of
the mature plant.
Adherence rate studies indicate a strong relationship between the
amount of time spores are allowed to settle onto glass plates and the
percentage of spores attached. Adherence percentages may improve with
time in one species and decrease with time in others (Suto, 1950; Charters,
et. al., 1972).
Temperature and salinity effects on early embryonic development have
been documented for species of Fucus (Munda, 1977; McLachlan, 1974; Bird
and McLachlan 1974), Hypnea (Mshigeni, 1976), and in Chondrus crispus
(Prince & Kingsbury, 1973). None of these studies have noted the effects
