Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.

RESULTS
Early morphological development of R. affine carpospores grown at
14°0/330/00 proceeds as illustrated in figure 1(a-i). The zygote divides
asymmetrically, the first 5 or 6 cell divisions occurring without
enlargement of the embryo. Subsequent cell divisions produce an embryo
which on glass appears discoid from overhead view. After 4-6 days uniseriate
hairs appear and project away from the holdfast. These hairs are lost
or resorbed after the embryo begins growth ofga thallus from the base.
Rhizoids typically project upwards and laterally from the growing thallus
(see figures 2(a) and 3). Carpospores settling within 100-200 um of one
another will overlap in territory as their holdfasts expand. In such
cases first the outermost cells of each embryo mingle and eventually the
two embryos coalesce into one. The resulting embryos are indistinguishable
from embryos decending from a single carpospore except that they are
larger in size (see figures 1(k,1) and 2(b)).
Figure 4 shows adherence of carpospores as a function of time. The
percentage of spores adhering increases rapidly until 20 minutes after
spores are artificially released when the greatest adherence percentage
was observed. Adherence percentages dropped to a low at 4 hours; the
mean low value at four hours is significantly below the combined mean
of the 20 through 60 minute values (Student's t-test, p£.01). During
early experimental trials if the glass slides were tipped, water would
run off of the slide and by capillary action all of the water covering a
newly-settled spore would be withdrawn. Spores so exposed would die
immediately as evidenced by dispersal of their organelles outside of
cell boundaries.
Results of the salinity experiments are shown in figures 5, 6, and 7.
