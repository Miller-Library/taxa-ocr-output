Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.

Joel D. Reimnitz
ABSTRACT
The percentage of carpospores of Rhodoglossum affine (Harvey)Kylin
adhered to glass plates was shown to attain a maximum level at 20 minutes
following artificial release and drop to a significantly lower level
at 4 hours.
Early morphological development of tetrasporophyte embryos is described,
One-week growth of embryos in response to gradients of temperature and
salinity have been investigated. In all treatments embryos grew signifi¬
cantly faster if settled first at 14°/330/oo then moved to environmental
growth baths than if settled directly in those baths.
The results suggest that it may be useful to study environmental
effects on early embryonic development and growth of R. affine carpospores
when considering the geographical distribution of the adult tetrasporophyte,
Key words: adherence, carpospore, embryo, Rhodoglossum affine, coalescence,

tetrasporophyte.
