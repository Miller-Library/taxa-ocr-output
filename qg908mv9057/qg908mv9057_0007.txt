Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.

Spores in both settlement conditions died within 1 week at 130/00 salinity.
Fastest growth of the embryos occurred at 330/00. Carpospores withstood
the highest salinity condition (730/00) although nearly all were still
undivided after one week. Observed embryos at 230/oo and 330/oo all had
disc-shaped holdfasts. At 430/00 rhizoids were noted in approximately
20 percent of observed embryos while at 530/0o at least 50 percent of
observed embryos had developed at least one rhizoid growing from the
holdfast base (see figure 1(j)). Contrasting the bath-settled population
of spores with the base-settled spores for each salinity shows them to
be growing at significantly different rates for each condition but
330/0o and 730/00 (Student's t-test, p2.01). Except at 330/oo the base¬
settled spores grew faster than bath-settled spores.
Results of temperature experiments are shown in figures 8 and 9 and
table 1. Greatest growth was observed at 20.5°C, with a percentage of
spores alive at 3 and 26 C and no spore surviving 28° exposure. All
temperature-treated embryos demonstrated disc-shaped holdfasts. For the
14° through 24 range base-settled spores were tested against bath-settled
spores and found to be growing at a significantly faster rate at each
temperature (Student's t-test, p.01).
In glass tubes filled with spores suspended in seawater and
placed in a light-sealed box, settlement by the spores after 4 days was
observed to occur only on the half of the tubes closest to a point light
source placed in the box.
