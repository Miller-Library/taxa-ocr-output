occurred to stimulate the embryos transferred to faster growth than
those never moved.
As the histograms of figure 9 show, the bath-settled spore popula¬
tions do not contain nearly as many large-size-class embryos at each
temperature as do the base-settled spore populations. If the size differ¬
ential between bath- and base-settled embryos were to be explained by the
washing away of less viable spores during the transfer process, fast-
growing embryos should still appear among the bath-settle embryos.
After one week of growth the combined average of bath- and base¬
settled embryos at 14°C/330/00 for the salinity test was 129/4m. and for
the temperature test 84um. There are several possible explanations for
this difference. The spores did come from difference spore batches, and
handling during the early collection processes was not identical. In
addition the salinity experiment was performed in a culture medium of
Instant Ocean plus Provasoli's medium; the temperature experiment was
performed in seawater plus Provasoli's. Mshigeni (1976) found large
differences in the growth of carpospore germlings as a function of the
culture media.
Red algal spores are reportedly non-motile. Observations with the
directional light study seem to indicate that spores selectively settle
or at least preferentially survive closest to a source of light. At
the very least, the conclusion to be drawn from this is that the place
of adherence and growth of the spores, given the environmental conditions,
was not strictly random. At the most one could hypothesize a response
on the part of the spores with respect to light. Tests of this hypothesis
are being planned.
If indeed the spores are somehow responsive to light this information
