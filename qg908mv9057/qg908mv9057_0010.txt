Having a high temperature optimum for growth would imply faster growth
rates during those seasons when the water temperature approaches the
optimum. If size of the plant has any bearing on its ability to resist
grazing effects and other environmental stresses this could possibly
lead to seasonal variations in the survival capacities of the early
plant. Quantities of spores released has been noted in some species to
follow lunar and seasonal patterns (Christie and Shaw, 1969; Guzmán-del-
Proo, et. al., 1972). It would be interesting to compare such release
patterns with water temperature and temperature optimums for growth of
algal embryos.
In both the salinity and the temperature experiments there was
significantly greater survival of the carpospores and faster embryonic
growth if the carpospores were settled at base conditions than if settled
at bath conditions. In the temperature experiments this occurred, even
when the two settlement temperatures were the same (14°C), so this result
is not explained by temperature shock on the base-settled spores.
In the temperature experiments the light conditions were similar for the
two settlement conditions but not identical. McLachlan (1974) has shown
that widely contrasting light conditions can have significantly different
effects on the development of algal embryos. Because light conditions
were uniform for all conditions in the salinity tests yet the differential
growth was still observed, it is unlikely that light conditions could
be the sole cause of the faster growth of the base-settled spores. Given
that water motion effects are necessary for optimum development and
growth of algal plants, the possibility exists that sometime during the
transfer of the coverslips from one bath to the next sufficient jostling
