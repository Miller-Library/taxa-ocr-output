CAPTIONS OF FIGURES
Figure 1: (a-h), Early morphological stages in the growth of R. affine
carpospores. (i) A one-week-old embryo pictured on the edge
of a coverslip. Note the uniseriate hairs ascending from the
holdfast region. (j) An embryo grown at 530/00 for 1 week.
Compare to (i) which was grown for 1 week at 330/00. (k,1).
2 and 3 embryos showing coalescence after one week of growth.
(a). A 2 week old embryo, showing beginning signs of thallus

growth from the holdfast. (b). Coalescence of two embryos which
have almost completely merged into one plant.
Scanning EM of a three-week old embryo. Note the numerous

Adherence of carpospores as a function of time. The three

lines represent three separate tests run with three different
spore batches. Not that although there is considerable
variation between batches in the percent adhering at a given
time they all demonstrate a high adherence percentage in
the 20-60 minute range and a lower adherence percentage
3 hours later.
