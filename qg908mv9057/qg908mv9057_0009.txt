occur from plant-to-plant and possibly from season-to-season in the
quality of this adhesive. They also reported, as the three runs shown
on figure 4 demonstrate, that there is considerable variation between
spore batches in the ability to adhere to glass.
What I suggest is that adhesive is released when the spore first
comes in contact with a surface and serves to anchor it initially.
Possibly then it does not harden effectively over time and proves inade¬
quate for keeping the spore attached when the spore is later exposed
to the forces of water flowing past it. Boney (1966) indicates that
water motion is necessary for optimum algal growth. As all experiments
here were performed under still-water conditions on an artificial
laboratory surface, the results may be a result of some missing
environmental "stimulus" promoting spore adhesion over time.
The observation that glass-attached spores die when the water surround-
ing them is withdrawn seems in a practical sense maladaptive on the part
of the spore, given that it could often be uncovered and left exposed
in the field at low tide. The observations refered
to were noted
in the early periods after spore settlement and it is unknown whether the
spore develops resistance to this type of exposure over time. If so this
early lack of exposure-resistance could require timing of settlement
such that early exposure is not likely to occur.
As figure 7 shows, R. affine carpospores grow fastest in the salinity
range of 230/0o to 430/00. The effects of salinity on growth are much
more apparent after 11 days than after 7 days, with growth at 230/oo and
530/00 being repressed much more than the 330/oo and 430/oo conditions,
The temperature optimum for growth of R. affine carpospores occurs
somewhere in between 17 and 24°C (figure 8). There are seasonal varia-
