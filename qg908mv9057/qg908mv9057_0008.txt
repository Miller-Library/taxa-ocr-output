Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.
Joel D. Reimnitz
DISCUSSION
Early morphological development of R. affine carpospores is similar
to development of the related red alsa Chondrus occellatus Holm examined
by Inoh (1947). A question not yet investigated is what is the
orientation of the asymmetrically-dividing embryo with respect to its
attachment orientation on the substrate.
Coalescence of algal embryos has been described in Chondrus crispus
(Tveter and Mathieson, 1976; Ring, 1970; Taylor and Chen, 1973), and
Gracilaria verrucosa (Jones, 1956). Coalesced sporelings have been shown
to produce fronds that grow more rapidly than non-coalesced sporelings
(Tveter and Mathieson, 1976). Because carpospores may yield either male
or female tetrasporophytes, such coalescence could have interesting
morphological and possibly physiological consequences in the resulting
plant. Further investigations into the morphology, physiology, and
reproduction of coalesced embryos are being planned.
How quickly a spore adheres to a substrate could influence where
or when they settle. That a percentage are attached after 5 minutes
and the highest percentage attached is observed at 20 minutes indicates
that settlement in R. affine carpospores can occur relatively rapidly.
They thus appear capable of adhering given the right local conditions
regardless of tidal conditions.
Adherence percentages for R. affine carpospores are highest between
O and 60 minutes from release then decrease with time up to 4 hours.
Christie, et. al. (1970) have shown that green algal zoospores have a
chemical adhesive contained in vesicles on the outer walls of the spore.
Adhesion is proposed to be a process of release of this adhesive and
hardening of the adhesive over time by chemical changes. Variation may
