Temperature and salinity experiments were performed by first
settling spores on 2 (salinity) or 4 (temperature) coverslips at each of
two different conditions: (1) Base-settled spores were settled for
hour in trays at 14°0, 330/00 salinity, and light intensity of 65/cm?,
then transferred to growth trays; (2) Bath-settled spores were settled
directly in the growth trays. The growth trays were 10 x 150 mm. plastic
petri dishes filled with 25 cc. of seawater adjusted to the various
experimental temperatures and salinities and enriched with Provasoli's
medium. After 1 week in the growth trays the coverslips were removed and
the diameter of the discoid holdfast base measured with an ocular micro¬
meter at 450X. At least 20 embryos were measured for each salinity con¬
dition except for 230/00 (14 counts), and at least 250 measurements at
each temperature condition.
The salinity experiment was performed in a 14°C constant-temperature
room with a 16:8 light:dark photoperiod at 65W/cm. All saline environ-
ments were created by mixing appropriate amounts of Instant Ocean (tm)
with distilled water.
The temperature experiment was performed by placing 16 x 30 cm.
plastic trays filled 5 mm. deep with distilled water in constant tempera¬
ture baths. The growth trays were floated on this distilled water. With
this arrangement the temperature inside the growth trays precisely matched
the temperature of the distilled water, which was monitored at 24 hour
intervals. The photoperiod was 16:8 light:dark at 40W/cm2.
