Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Female R. affine were collected at low tide at Pt. Pinos, California,
rinsed briefly in filtered seawater and air-dried for one hour. All
seawater used was first passed through a 54 filter. After drying, fronds
were placed cystocarp down in plastic dishes filled 1 cm. deep with
seawater at 22.5 C. Pink patches of carpospores began appearing on the
dish bottom within 2 hours. Spores were withdrawn within ½ hour after
the cystocarp began to shed using a pasteur pipette, deposited in a 10 cc.
beaker, and diluted to a workable (7-10 spores per field when a drop of
spore solution was examined at 100X) density with 14°C seawater.
For adherence tests a paper grid with 10 prominently-marked 1.3 x 1.3
mm. squares was epoxied between two glass slides. A 1 mm.high lip was
built on the top slide around the area of the grid using silicone glue
to prevent water run-off in the grid area. Slides were placed in 10 x 150
mm. petri dishes and covered with 25 cc. seawater. Tests were performed
at 14 C at a light intensity of 100W/cm'. One drop of a freshly-prepared
spore solution was dropped at each of the four corners of the grid area.
At scheduled times, slides were withdrawn from the dishes and the number
of spores within the limits of each of the 10 marked squares was tabulated.
Next the slide was rinsed by dipping it gently into a basin of seawater
at 14 C, holding it vertically, and moving it 8 times across the distance
of 15 cm. in approximately 5 seconds. Charters, et. al. (1972) noted
little change in the percent of spores adhering to plates under a wide
range of force. Following this rinse the same 10 squares were again counted
for spores and the ratio of spores present after the rinse to before the
rinse was multiplied by 100 to get the percent adhering.
