Adherence, growth of R. affine carpospores.
Joel D. Reimnitz
supplies some further explanations as to what may be happening in the
adherence rate tests. The adherence rate tests were performed in condiÂ¬
tions of diffuse light. Investigators of green algal zoospore attachment
perform their tests in the dark because the spores respond to light
and make the results uninterpretable (Christie and Shaw, 1968). If
R. affine carpospores respond to light, an initial contact with a
horizontal surface would release the chemical adhesive in the area on
the wall of the spore touching the surface. No further vesicles would
come in contact if the spore were seeking settlement in the direction
of light and no more adhesive would be released. Over time the spore
would simply not have enough adhesive present to be able to remain
attached to the plate when subject to water motion effects.
Growth of embryos in high salinity water yields abberrations in
early growth morphology. Variations in growth forms depending upon the
environmental exposure of the embryo have been well documented (McLachlan,
1974; Chen and McLachlan, 1972).
In this study growth at many temperature and salinity conditions
vields data indicating that there are differences in the growth rate
of embryos depending upon the environmental conditions they are subject
to. Whether these differences lead to later variations in the size and
morphology of adult plants is a question well worth further investigation.
As the bath-base studies indicate, small changes in the history of the
embryo may stimulate plants to different growth rates. It might be well
to consider these observations when analyzing distribution of growth
forms of a species in the field and the geographical distribution of
a given species.
