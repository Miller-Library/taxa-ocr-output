of local environmental conditions during settlement on early growth.
I here report on adherence rate studies undertaken in the lab with
R. affine carpospores. Also reported are the effects of temperature and
salinity on the one-week growth of R. affine tetrasporophytes settled in
"normal" environments (Monterey Bay water conditions during May) versus
"stressful" environments (various temperature and salinity conditions).
