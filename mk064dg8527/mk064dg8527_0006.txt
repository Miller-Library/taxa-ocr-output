RESULTS
Phosphoglucomutase:
In this enzyme system no genetic variation was found within or between the
species examined. Electrophoretic phenotypes encoded by two loci are shown Fig. 1
and 2. Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Place and Powers, 1977), the major
isozyme, PGM-A, was present in both muscle and liver tissue. These PGM-A
electromorphs were identical in liver and muscle tissue of S. paucispinis and S.
goodei. The other enzyme phenotype, PGM-B, was detected in very low quantities
in liver and only after extensive incubation. It was surprising to detect minor
amounts of PGM-B activity in muscle tissue which had not been observed previously
in fish. This activity detected could have been a proteolytic by-product that still had
catalytic activity but a different net charge. PGM-B had the same electrophoretic
mobility between tissues and between species.
Glucosephosphate isomerase:
Two loci were expressed for glucosephosphate isomerase, GPI-A, and GPI-B
(Fig. 3 and 4). GPI-A had the same electrophoretic mobility in both species but was
specific for muscle tissue. Variation exists between the individualâ€™s muscle and liver
tissues. Interestingly, this differential expression of loci occurs for both species.
The GPI-B locus was expressed in both the liver and muscle tissues of the
two species. Allelic variation was observed at this locus in S. paucispinis in both
tissues. Lanes 1 and 4 (Fig. 5) show the heterozygote. One out of the twenty fish
tested had this phenotype, and therefore possessed all the allozymes of the GPI-B
isozyme: Baa Bab BbP. Lanes 2 and 5 show the predominant genotype for GPI-B,
the homozygote GPI-Baa. Nineteen of twenty fish expressed this allozyme. Lanes 3
and 6 are predictions of the third phenotype, not seen in the tested sample size, but
which would exist in natural populations.
