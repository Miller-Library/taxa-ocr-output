Malate dehydrogenase:
This was the only enzyme of six tested that showed genetic variation between
species. Electrophoretic phenotypes encoded for by four loci were observed, MDH-
A, MDH-B, MDH-C, MDH-D (Fig. 12 and 13). Resolution in liver was difficult for
both species. The MDH-D isozyme was clearly visible in S. goodei in both liver and
muscle tissue (Fig. 12), but it was completely absent in S. paucispinis, and thus it was
a distinquishing isozyme between the two species.
Isozymes MDH-A, MDH-B, and MDH-C do not exhibit the variation nor the
clarity in resolution that MDH-D provides, thus speculation is required. Presumed
differences are detected within individuals of S. goodei. MDH-A is expressed in
muscle but not in liver. The same is true for MDH-C. More analyses could be
made from Fig. 12 but much speculation is needed, and therefore will not be
discussed further. Table 1 is a summary of the analyses made in this experiment.
DISCUSSION
The fact that five of six enzymes systems were shown to be identical between
S. paucispinis and S. goodei is very unusual (Dennis Powers, personal
communication). One would expect that two species of fish, whose external
morphology is very different, would not show such biochemical similarity. It must
be pointed out that this similarity refers only to the net charge of the enzymes, and
not to the entire amino acid sequence. Two proteins which show identical
electrophoretic movement may contain different amino acid sequences.
Alternatively, substitution of a single amino acid could alter the mobility of the
protein greatly. Yet the similarity that does exist between the two species, for these
enzymes, is striking.
PGM, EST, and SDH were the three enzyme systems that showed no
variation of any kind in the two species. The other enzymes showed minor
