The three electrophoretic bands present in the heterozygote suggest that the
enzyme GPI is a dimer. The band in the middle is heavier in color because its
phenotype (B2b) can be formed two ways, Ba0 or B0a. Assuming the same Keq for
all the dimerization reactions.
Esterase:
Three enzyme phenotypes were observed that presumably code for three
loci: EST-A, EST-B, EST-C (Fig. 6 and 7). No genetic variation was found within
or between the species for this enzyme. The liver contained all three electromorphs
with identical electromorphic mobility. This is not likely to indicate heterozygousity
because every fish tested was shown to have these three bands, and the probability
of every individual of the sample size (n=20) being a heterozygote is very low.
Resolution of the esterase stain in muscle was difficult and no definitive results were
reported.
Isocitrate dehydrogenase:
Two electrophoretic phenotypes were observed in this enzyme system which are
presumably encoded by two loci, IDH-A, and IDH-B (Fig. 8 and 9) The expression
of the IDH-A locus, like GPI-A, was tissue dependent. IDH-A was present
exclusively in the liver tissue of both species, whereas IDH-B was specific for muscle
tissue. No interspecific differences were evident in either electromorph.
Sorbitol Dehydrogenase:
In this enzyme system only one isozyme was detected in both liver and
muscle, SDH-A, and both species had the same phenotype (Fig. 10 and 11).
