ABSTRACT
Electrophoretic techniques were used to analyze the genetic variation of
Sebastes paucispinis and Sebastes goodei. Three types of variation were examined:
variation between the muscle and liver tissues of an individual, between individuals
of a species, and between species. Six enzyme systems were used:
phosphoglucomutase (PGM), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), esterase (EST),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), sorbital dehydrogenase (SDH), and malate
dehydrogenase (MDH). GPI, IDH, and MDH showed variation between tissues
within individual fish. Allelic variation was detected at GPI-B in S. paucispinis.
MDH proved to be the only distinguishing enzyme between the two species; all
other isozymes had identical electrophoretic mobilities in both species.
INTRODUCTION
An important aspect in understanding speciation is determining the degree of
genetic variability between and within a species. One method of examining genetic
variation is by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of enzymes using gel
electrophoresis. This method was used to examine the enzymes:
phosphoglucomutase (PGM), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), esterase (EST),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) in Sebastes paucispinis and Sebastes goodei.
Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules or proteins
based on charge and/or size. Charged molecules in solution migrate through a
porous medium (starch gel) in the presence of an electric field. Nonpigmented
molecules are made visible in the gel by an appropriate staining procedure (E.A.
Martin, 1983). Three types of electrophoretic variation of enzymes are possible: (1)
variation between tissues within an individual, (2) variation between individuals
within a species, and (3) variation between species.
