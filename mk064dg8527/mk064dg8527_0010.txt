juvenile fish. When fish are young their morphology has not developed to the point
of correctly distinguishing them from each other. Thus finding an electrophoretic
difference in MDH between S. paucispinis and S. goodei becomes a powerful
resource of information, provided that there is no change in the expression of loci
during development.
Malate dehydrogenase is different from the other five enzymes in that there
is a mitochondrial and cytoplasmic form. Further experiments would have to be
done to determine the difference in electromobility of the two distinct forms for
these two species.
After examining the electrophoretic variability of six enzymes in S.
paucispinis and S. goodei, and finding five of the six identical between species one
may conclude that there is great selection pressure for these enzymes. MDH,
contrarily, showed variation between species and may prove to be a useful
diagnostic tool.
