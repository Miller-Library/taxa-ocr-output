The expression of different loci for the same enzyme in different tissues is an
example of variation within an individual. These variant forms of an enzyme,
produced by different loci, are known as isozymes and can be distinguished by.
electrophoresis. Isozymes vary in their electrophoretic mobility, not in the reactions
they catalyze within the cell. Alternatively, differential expression of loci in the
same tissue type among individuals within the same species is variation within a
species. For example, muscle tissue may contain four isozymes in the same species.
Finally, there is variation that exists between species, where one species shows a
different isozyme than another species. All three types of variation were detected in
this experiment.
The bands formed by the histochemical staining of the gel vary in thickness
and intensity. This corresponds to the level of enzyme activity within the cell, i.e.
the heavier the band the greater the concentration of the enzyme.
The two species of Sebastes studied in this experiment differ in their external
morphology. The S. paucispinis, commonly called the Bocaccio (B), is recognized
for its large mouth and projecting chin. The upper jaw usually extends beyond the
rear of the eye, and the profile is slightly concave between the snout and dorsal fin,
with a noticeable dip above eye. The S. goodei, commonly known as the chilipepper
(C), has a convex space between the eyes (curves outward) and the upper jaw ends
below midpoint of the eye. Also noteworthy in the Chilipepper is the white lateral
line in a clear red or pink zone, not present in the Bocaccio (Peterson, 1983). The
skin of both species of fish can be pinkish, reddish, or grayish in color and therefore
is not a useful distinguishing characteristic. Both species were found at depths of
300-500 feet in the Monterey area.
