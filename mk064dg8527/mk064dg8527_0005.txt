High purity agarose (Difco Lab., Detroit, MI) was used for PGM, GPI, SDH,
IDH in the overlay stain since it provides the clearest background for photographic
documentation. Stained gels were fixed and stored in methanol-acetic acid-water
(S:1:5). This is also done for photographic reasons. The solution sharpens the color
difference between the bands and the white background.
Lithium hydroxide gels were run at constant voltages of 325 V for 5 hours at
4°C. Tris-citrate gels were run at the same voltage and temperature but for 20
hours. All electrophoreses were performed on a horizontal gel system using
Heathkit IP-17 constant-voltage power supplies. Controls for non-specific staining
were not done.
Nomenclature
Each locus will be dealt with individually to facilitate discussion. The
nomenclature used to designate each allozyme, a variant of the same locus,
corresponds to its relative electrophoretic mobility in the specified buffer system.
Loci are assigned capital letters: the slowest in mobility is given by A, followed by B
for the next slowest, and so on. Allelic variants at each locus are assigned lowercase
superscripts: the fastest is given by a, followed by b, c, etc. For example, isozyme
GPI-B has the alleles Baä, Ba°, and B°°. To describe the phenotype of a particular
isozyme all capital letters were used (e.g. IDH for isocitrate dehydrogenase or PGM
for phosphoglucomutase).
