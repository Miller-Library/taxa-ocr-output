MATERIALAND METHODS
Chemicals
Hydrolyzed starch for gel electrophoresis and all reagents for the
histochemical staining of each system were obtained from Sigma Chemicals (St.
Louis, Missouri). All other chemicals were reagent grade.
Tissue Preparation
Muscle and liver samples were dissected from fish caught on local party
boats. A piece of each tissue was taken from S. paucispinis and S. goodei, and placed
in a labeled 17x10 mm polyethylene test tube; the tubes were then covered with ice.
The tissues were brought to the lab and frozen in liquid No or used fresh. No
discernable difference was noticed in the stained gels of the tissues stored in liquid
No, as consistent with the findings of Place and Powers (1977).
The fresh or frozen tissue (0.1-0.2 g) was minced with a razor blade and
placed into a labeled microfuge tube. Approximately 0.5 ml sonicating buffer
containing 20 mM Tris/citrate pH 7.5, .3 MNaSO4, lmM MnSO, and 10% (v/v)
glycerol was added before sonification. Cells were disrupted with five 5-sec bursts
from a Heat Systems Sonifier set at 30 W. All homogenates were kept on ice.
Lipid and solid particles were removed by centrifugation for 5-10 minutes in
a eppendorf centrifuge at approximately 12,000-15,000g.
Electrophoretic Procedure
PGM, GPI, and EST were resolved utilizing the lithium hydroxide buffer
system of Selander et al. (1969) and were stained according to procedures outlined
by Shaw and Prasad (1970).
SDH, IDH, and MDH were resolved using a tris-citrate buffer system, which
contained 78g starch, 60g sucrose, 2 drops B-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 ml Triton-X 100,
50 ml glycerol, 9 ml Tris-citrate buffer pH 6.9 (Place and Powers, 1978). The gels
were stained using the methods of Shaw and Prasad (1970).
