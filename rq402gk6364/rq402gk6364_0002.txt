INTRODUCTION
The sandy beach environment, though familiar to many,
remains a complex and bewildering ecosystem. Its trophic
structure is based on quantities of suspended particulate
organic matter, which "may serve as food directly or by con¬
tributing to the total carbon budget" (Fox, 1950).
The components of this suspended matter are phytoplank-
ton, zooplankton, bacteria, and detritus. Numerous studes
in various seas and coastal areas indicate that the major
portion of particulate matter is detritus (Odum & de la Cruz,
1967, Krey, 1967, Khailov & Finenko, 1970, Finenko & Zaika,
1970, Suschenya & Finenko, 1966, Ryther & Menzel, 1965,
Steele & Baird, 1961, Parsons & Strickland, 1962, Glynn,
1965). Detritus is here defined as "all types of biogenic
material in various stages of microbial decomposition which
represent a potential energy source for consumer species
(Darnell, 1967), and is recognized as the energy source at
the base of many ecosystems (Teal, 1962, Darnell, 1967, Heald,
1969, Odum & de la Cruz, 1963).
Most of the organisms of the sandy beach (e.g. echino¬
derms, sipunculid & annelid worms) depend either on "copious
supplies of finely divided and suspended, adsorbed, or preci¬
pitated organic detritus as a primary source of nutrition'
(Fox, 1950) or on the larger algal detritus washed up as
wrack. The concentration and composition of this organic
matter at any time and place is subject to an intricate array
