of littoral factors, "an equilibrium between input rates and
removal rates, and we can do little more than guess at these
magnitudes" (Strickland, 1970).
Though some work has been done on the role and composiÂ¬
tion of organic material in estuarine and rocky intertidal
environments (Glynn, 1965, McIntyre, 1970, Teal, 1962, Odum
& de la Cruz, 1967, Darnell, 1967, Heald, 1969), very little
research has been conducted on the energetics of the sandy
beach ecosystem. This study is an attempt to determine the
amount of suspended particulate matter (less than 1 cm in
diameter) available to the sandy beach ecosystem in terms of
organic carbon, the distribution of size and nature of the
particles, the protein content of the particles, and some of
the littoral factors affecting the availability of this material
to the benthic community of the sandy beach.
