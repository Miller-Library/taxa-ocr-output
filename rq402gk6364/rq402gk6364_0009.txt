sheltering and filtering properties of floating wrack, and
the ability of detrital particles to interfere with settling,
all cause irregular pockets of detrital distribution along
the beach (Smith, 1968). Greater amounts and variation in
fine suspended particulate matter are thus to be expected
under turbulent water conditions. This is clearly shown in
Figure 2.
On calmer days, when the littoral floor is free of stir¬
ring, "the final resting place of much of the plant detritus
of the littoral is the littoral sediments" (Smith, 1968).
There are many forces favoring the retention of this material
within the littoral: the extent of the littoral, failure of
water carrying properties with depth, and the settling ten¬
dencies of detritus, especially when further consolidated by
mucus or transformation into fecal pellets. A picture emerges
of a standing pool of littoral particulate material of rela¬
tively constant magnitude, alternating between a suspended and
settled state. This pool is in equilibrium with overall
littoral input and output rates.
In the future, quantitative and qualitative studies should
be conducted on this particulate littoral material, but its
role in the energetics of the sandy beach ecosystem is of pri¬
mary importance and must not be overlooked: Basic information
badly needed includes: 1) availability of material for feeding
organisms. 2) actual utilization of the material under field
conditions, and 3) nutritive value for the consuming species
(Darnell, 1967). The precise nutritive role of organic detri¬
tus has yet to be determined.
