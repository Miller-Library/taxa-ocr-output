DISCUSSION
The composition and concentration of suspended particu¬
late organic matter in the water column over a sandy beach
ecosystem vary constantly in time and space. These differences
appear to be averaged out over a periodof time well within the
lifespan of many sandy beach fauna. During the period of
study, remarkable similarities were found in the amount and
nature of material collected from two beaches characterized
by different physical and biological parameters. This suggests
that conditions other than the amount of suspended organic
matter available to the ecosystem are important in determining
the nature of some sandy beach communities.
The size distribution of particulate organic carbon was
virtually the same in both beaches. Approximately 53% of the
material was in the size range .45 to 500 microns; 11% in the
range of 500 microns to 1 mm; and 36% in the size class 1 mm to
1 cm in diameter. The predominant portion of suspended matter
in both beach ecosystems was organic plant detritus (80%),
followed by zooplankton (7%), phytoplankton (5%), and inorganic
debris (5%). The smallest particles (.45-500 microns) were the
richest in protein. A combination of several factors may be
responsible: 1) the smaller organisms are protein-rich (e.g.
phytoplankton, bacteria) and/or 2) the smaller detrital par-
ticles are older and have a greater surface area to volume
ratio, thus supporting a larger buildup of protein-rich micro¬
bial populations.
