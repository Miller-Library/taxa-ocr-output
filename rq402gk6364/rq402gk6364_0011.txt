SUMMARY
Some characteristics of suspended particulate matter, includÂ¬
ing amount, nature, and size distribution of the particles,
as well as the littoral factors affecting its availability
were investigated at two pocket sandy beaches in Monterey Bay.
The amount of suspended material varied with wave turbulence,
but differences averaged out over time.
Most (80%) of the particulate matter was detritus of algal
rigin. Zooplankton comprised 7% of the matter, followed
by phytoplankton (5%) and inorganic debris (5%).
The size distribution of particulate organic carbon was
virtually the same in both beaches. Approximately 53% of
the material was in the size range of .45 to 500 microns.
The smallest particles were the richest in protein (70%).
The hydrodynamic forces which apparently cause extensive
variation in the organic material are the same processes
which maintain a standing pool of littoral particulate
matter.
The alternation of this material between a suspended and
settled state affects its availability to different sandy
beach biota.
