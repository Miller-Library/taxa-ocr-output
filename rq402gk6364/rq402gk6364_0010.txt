Though all the suspended material in the water column
is theoretically "available" to consuming species, most of
the benthic biota of sandy beaches can only utilize what is
in, on, or close to the bottom. Of the standing pool of
littoral particulate material, only a limited supply is
abailable to any specific type of feeding organism a√ü one
time.
Critical tide factors divide the beach into sectors
exposed to sudden sharp differences in water submersion
time (Doty, 1971). Different lengths of exposure to water
should divide the beach into sectors receiving distindly
different amounts of nutrient material. The organic carbon
content of sand from these different areas, and/or biotic
communities characteristic of them, could be a function of
critical tidal heights.
The amount of organic matter entering and leaving the
sandy beach ecosystemsis balanced against the amount retained
within the system. As Seki (1968) observes, for a continuous
input (L),
where X - amount organic material
remaining at timet
X = (L/k) (1-e-kt
decomposition rate factor
(in sandy beach ecosystems,
outflow and utilization
rates are also components)
If over long periods of time, X is a constant, steady state
(ss) amount;
Xss - L/k
If one measures the organic carbon content remaining in the
sand (Xgs) and L (the amt. suspended in the water) is the
same for two pocket beaches, then k may be a useful index for
comparing littoral sand beach communities.
