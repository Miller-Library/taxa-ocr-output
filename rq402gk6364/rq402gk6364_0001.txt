ABSTRAC
Some characteristics of suspended particulate matter over
two pocket sandy beaches were investigated.
The amount of suspended material varied with wave turbulence
but differences averaged out over time.
Most particulate matter (80%) was algal detritus. Fifty perÂ¬
cent ranged from .45 microns to 500 microns in diameter.
A standing pool of littoral particuate matter seems to be
maintained, alternating between a suspended and settled state.
Availability to biota depends on balance between states.
