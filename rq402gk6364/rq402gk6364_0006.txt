The average amount of organic carbon in each size class
was expressed as a percentage of the average total suspended
organic carbon. Both beaches had similar size distributions
(Figure 5). The smallest size fraction (.45-500 microns) con¬
tained the largest amount of organic carbon, the middle size
raction (500 microns - lmm) contained the least.
Microscopic examination of the suspended material pro¬
duced observations relatively consistent for the two beaches
over time and corresponding closely with those of other
studies (Glynn, 1965, Odum & de la Cruz, 1967). The pro¬
portions most commonly found were: Phytoplankton - 5%:
Zooplankton - 7%; inorganic debris (e.g. sand) - 5%; and
organic detritus - 80% (Figure 6). All but 2% or 3% of the
organic detritus appeared to be fragmentary remains of benthic
algal origin.
The amounts of chlorophyll a (micrograms/liter) obtained
for the smallest size class were converted to micrograms
phytoplanktonic carbon per liter after the method of
Finenko and Suschenya (1966). These values varied, both
absolutely and as the percentage of total suspended organic
carbon. A mean of 7% phytoplankton, correlating closely with
values discussed above, was obtained for both beaches (Figure
6).
Protein (percentage organic carbon) was determined for
two different size classes: .45 microns to 500 microns, and
500 microns to 1 cm. The smaller sized material on both
beaches contained much more protein than the larger particles,
(Figure 7).
