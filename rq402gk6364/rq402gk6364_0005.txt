were determined by flourometric analysis. (Strickland & Parsons,
1965).
RESULTS
Different quantities of suspended particulate organic
matter were collected at Boatworks Beach and Marinostat Beach
at different times. This variation was strongly correlated
with the intensity of local wave stirring (Figure 2). Boat¬
works Beach was characterized by higher turbulence during
the sampling time, resulting in slightly higher amounts of
suspended carbon. Fluctuations in the abundance of sand
were also related to water turbulence.
When the amount of suspended material collected at each
beach was averaged over the period of study, remarkably simi¬
lar figures were obtained: 2879 micrograms/liter + 1207 micro¬
grams/liter as one standard deviation (Boatworks Beach) and
2115 micrograms/liter + 1057 micrograms/liter (Marinostat
Beach). This data is presented in Figure 3.
The amount of suspended material in each of the three
size classes considered: .45 microns - 500 microns; 500 microns¬
Imm; Imm - lcm; varied between the four sample sets taken at
any one time on a beach and between beaches sampled at the same
time. Thus, the relative proportion of material in each size
class (and the corresponding standard deviation) was different
each sample time (see data Appendix 1). Figure 4 gives some
indication of this fluctuation in the size distribution of
suspended organic carbon.
