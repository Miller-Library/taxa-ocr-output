MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two beaches at Hopkins Marine Station, characterized by
vastly different physical parameters and ecological communi¬
ties, were chosen as sites for a comparative study. (Figure 1),
Boatworks Beach is a long, shallowly sloping beach, dominated
by fine sand grains (Md % -
and protected from heavy wave
action. Marinostat Beach is a shorter, steeply sloping beach
composed of coarser sand grains (Md % -) and exposed to
heavy wave action.
Four two-liter sea water samples were taken at each beach
just behind the roil line at approximately the same time,
Preliminary studies corroborated those of Glynn (1965) indica¬
ting that there was no appreciable difference in samples taken
during the light or dark periods of the day. Samples were
therefore taken in daylight hours during the first 3 weeks of
May at times subject to different tidal and other physical
conditions. Local wave turbulence was estimated visually as
the magnitude of water stirring at the roil line.
The sea water was filtered through a series of Tyler
screens with pores 1 cm, lmm, and 500 microns in diameter.
A 500 milliliter aliquot of filtrate was passed through a .45
micron HA Millipore Filter coated with a suspension of 1% Mgcoz.
The particulate matter remaining on the two smaller screens
and millipore filter was washed into separate tubes and collected
by centrifugation. Organic carbon was determined by a wet
oxidation method (Strickland & Parsons, 1965). Protein was
measured by the Lowry method. Chlorophyll a and phaeophytin
