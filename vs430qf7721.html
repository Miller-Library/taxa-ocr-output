Introduction
The area of transition just above and including the high intertidal zone
is characterized by a unique blend of marine and terrestial conditions. It
is an area inhabited by few obvious species. One of the dominant forms is the
isopod Ligia occidentalis, which inhabits rocky rubble immediately above the
highest tide mark (Miller, 1938).
Nothing is known of the role Ligia occidentalis plays in the conversion
of biomass in this habitat, of its food habits or its food preferences.
Studies of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ligia pallasii : Exact'>Ligia pallasii</span> (Carefoot, 1973) indicate it is an effective
consumer of macro algae in the high intertidal and may effect a measurable
control on the abundance of certain algae in that zone.
This study is a documentation of the dietary habits of Ligia occidentalis
both in the field and laboratory. It also reports on preliminary experiments
indicating an activity pattern differing from that reported for other <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ligia : Exact'>Ligia</span>
species.
Methods
Ligia occidentalis was collected along the rocky shore in Pacific Grove,
California, at Lovers Point and at Hopkins Marine Station from the large rocky
rubble located 1.00-1.25 m above the endocladia zone. This region receives
salt-water spray during high tide which collects on pools under this rubble
and ensures a supply of water that <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Ligia : PartialExact'>Ligia may</span> dip their uropods into. In these
high tidepools grow various blue-green, and filamentous green algae. The
stock supply of isopods was kept in plastic tubs perforated on the bottom with
small holes. Each tub was supplied with running sea water at 15 degrees
centigrade. Algae were supplied for food. All experiments were carried out
at an air temperature of 18-21 degrees centigrade.

Results
Field Studies
The following experiment determined what species of algae Ligia consumed
in the field. Twenty Ligia were collected from the Hopkins and Lovers Point
sites and placed in separate plastic tubs for 24hrs. Fecal pellets from each
group were collected, mounted on slides, and compared to reference slides of
algae. The presence or absence of algae in each pellet was recorded. The
frequency of occurrence of algae which appeared in fecal pellets from both
sites was then compared.
Examination of fecal pellets collected from the field specimens held for
24hrs, revealed the following (see Fig. 1). Ligia from the Hopkins site
consumed significantly more blue-green and green algae than the Ligia from
Lovers Point. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>Macrocystis</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cystoseira : Exact'>Cystoseira</span> were taken more frequently at the
Lovers Point site. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Porphyra : Exact'>Porphyra</span> and diatoms were the other food items commonly
found in the fecal pellets of Ligia. Granite fragments were present in 55
percent (Hopkins) to 85 percent (Lovers Point) of the fecal pellets,
indicating that the Ligia may be actively consuming granite as part of their
diet. Red alga were eaten with a greater frequency at Lovers Point, but were
still found less than 10 percent of the time.
Estimate of the Relative Abundance of Drift Macro Algae
Estimates of the relative abundance of drift algae in each study site
were made in the following manner. Five 10m transects were placed parallel to
the shore contours. Ten .25 x .25m quadrats placed at regular intervals along
each transect were then used to sample the area for drift algae. Algae were
identified by eye and their presence noted on data sheets. Relative abundance
was obtained by dividing the number of times an alga was found in the quadrat
by the total number of quadrats taken.
H. Loren Fong-5
Examination of Fig. 2 reveals two obvious trends. Lovers Point had a
significantly higher amount of the brown algae Macrocystis and Cystoseira, and
Hopkins showed the larger abundance of blue-greens and filamentous greens.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phyllospadix : Exact'>Phyllospadix</span> and the epiphyte <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Smithora : Exact'>Smithora</span> occurred with similar frequency in both
sites.
Food Preference
Food preference in Ligia was tested in the following manner. Twenty
Ligia were starved for 24hrs and placed in a plastic tub containing a
chunk of granite, and equal amounts of algae commonly found in the study
areas. The animals were fed for 48 hrs and all of the fecal pellets
collected. Each pellet was scored using the same method described earlier.
Results from examination of the fecal pellets collected in the food
preference study are shown in Fig. 3. The frequency of occurence was used as
an indicator of "food preference". Significantly more Macrocystis and
Cystoseira were consumed in all of the experimental trials. The red alga
Porphyra was eaten 25-30 percent of the time. Diatoms and granite fragments
were also present.
Activity Pattern
To monitor activity patterns, 10 Ligia were placed in a plastic tub with
various algae for food. A control group of 10 were placed in a separate tub
without food. Each received a constant flow of sea-water. The behavior was
then monitored in 15 minute intervals over a period of 6 hrs. Those Ligia
walking or eating were scored as active. Those Ligia sitting on the rock,
sitting on the algae or resting on the bottom of the tub were considered to be
inactive. For each 15 minute interval the percent active were calculated, and
the results are shown in figure 4.
H. Loren Fong-6
The period of greatest activity in this Ligia species occurred during
the daylight hours. Most activity occurred from mid-morning to late
afternoon. During dusk to dawn the Ligia were inactive, with the majority of
individuals clustering around the small chunk of granite in the tub. When no
granite was available, the Ligia would group together in the corner of the
plastic tubs. This experement was replicated twice, and the results were the
same. Although the control animals did not have any food available to them,
they still demonstrated the same activity period.
Discussion
It is apparent from field data and laboratory experiments that Ligia
occidentalis feed extensively on the drift algae present in their habitat
(Miller, 1938). Although other species of Ligia migrate daily into the
intertidal zone during low tide (Carefoot 1973, Hewitt 1907), <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>L. occidentalis</span>
does not appear to do so. Instead they remain in the same area and exploit
the algae that wash onto the beach. The differences in the algae present in
the fecal pellets from the Lovers point site and at Hopkins (See Fig 1)
indicate Ligia is an opportunistic forager and will eat the algae which occurs
most frequently. Studies by Nicholls in 1931 indicate Ligia have enzymes
which act readily on most carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, but do not have
the cellulase required to digest cell walls. This would explain why the fecal
pellet contents look much like the gut contents. The granite fragments found
in the gut may be used to break down the cell walls allowing digestion of the
contents of at least some of the cells. My experiments using the brown, red,
and green algae, indicate that the Ligia probably utilize each of these algal
resources, thereby maximally exploiting available food sources.
H. Loren Fong-7
Their activity during the day is a pattern opposite to that reported for
Ligia pallasii (Carefoot, 1973) and for other species of Ligia (Saito, 1965).
These two Ligia were most active at night. The physiological adaptations of
diurnal chromatophore changes (Armitage, 1960) and sensitive visual system
(Ruck & Jahn, 1954) give Ligia an adaptive advantage for daylight foraging.
Behaviorally, Ligia exhibit a quick startle response, which sends them
scurrying for the nearest available cover (Armitage, 1960). Because Ligia can
forage underneath the rocky rubble, they may not be vary susceptable to
predation by birds.
One can speculate that the Ligia may help the dispersal of various types
of alga, such as the high intertidal Porphyra. The presence of a healthy baby
plant within the fecal pellet (personal observation) and the lack of
cellulase in the gut (Nicholls, 1931) may indicate a mechanism whereby Ligia
are dispersing rather than limiting the distribution of some high-intertidal
algae.
Whether or not the granite fragments are utilized to grind and break
through the tough cell wall of the algae or are taken accidentally while the
Ligia are eating diatoms is a question which remains to be answered.
Although the Ligia are eating these various food types, we still do not
know what they are utilizing. The gut contents look very much like the fecal
pellets and it does not appear that much breakdown of products has occurred.
Perhaps the major ecological role of Ligia occidentalis is to reduce large
drift down into small bits. There is no doubt that they can process large
amounts in very short periods of time (Carefoot, 1973). From the present
results it can be speculated that the role of Ligia in the transition zone is
geared towards disposal of drift algae and that their impact upon the
distribution of intertidal algae may be minimal.
