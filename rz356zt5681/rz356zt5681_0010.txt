The results of relaxed starfish flexibility tests
conflict somewhat with observations of natural bending in
the obstacle tank. The degree of flexibility seems to
vary less among species at natural rates of flection.
The importance of such observations would be greatly strengthÂ¬
ened if more exhaustive statistically relevant examination
were made. Nevertheless, these results encouraged analysis
of material properties to explain the relation of material
stiffness and strain rate. Stiffness varies among species
and between rates of strain for each species. This variation
of stiffness can be related to ossicle mass (table 3).
For a composite material arranged serially (roughly the
situation in a starfish arm) the inverse of Young's modulus
is equal to the sum of the ratios of volume fraction to
stiffness of each component in the material (Wainwright
et al '76).

where Eg is the total stiffness, Eg is soft tissue stiffness,
E, is ossicle stiffness and Vy is ossicle volume fraction.
Again the ossicle stiffness is so much greater than the
stiffness of the soft tissue that the ratio of ossicle
volume fraction to ossicle stiffness is negligible. Therefore,
