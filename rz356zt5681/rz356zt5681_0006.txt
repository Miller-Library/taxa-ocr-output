Flexibility
Pycnopodia is the most flexible of the 3 starfish
examined (table 1). Lateral flexibility in this species
is approximately half that of oral or aboral flixibility.
Pisaster shows approximately equal values of flexibility
in all directions. Patiria, the least flexible species,
is half as flexible as Pisaster in the lateral and oral
flections and one fourth as flexible in the aboral flection.
To check the values from this experiment, behavioral
observations were made of the 12 starfish in the obstacle
tank. If placed on the pipes manually, all three species
bend around the pipe to hold on with a majority of tube
feet. It is noted that if the radius of pipe is smaller,
the period of time of bending is longer. The best demonÂ¬
strations of flexibility by all three species is obtained
by inverting the starfish and observing righting behavior,
The rate of flection seen in this experiment varies among
the species more than the degree of flexibility. Pycnopodia
was the fastest bender, and Patiria was the slowest.
Material Properties
The contribution of dry ossicle mass to total wet
mass is 4% in Pycnopodia, 15% in Pisaster, and 16% in
Patiria.
Stress-strain curves are determined for patches of the
aboral skeleton at 2 different strain rates (as described
in material and methods) and are shown in figures 5 and
6. Each outgoing curve (extension) and returning curve
