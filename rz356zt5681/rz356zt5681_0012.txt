a curve, the minimum value of which is yet to be determined.
3) The amount of tissue damage done at the 2 strain rates
may have been different. The plastic flow, a measurement
of material destruction, is much greater at the faster
rate (up to 50%) than at the slower one (only 20%). Patiria
may have stretched at the fast rate while the other 2 species
may have just torn. Both the problems of individual dif¬
ference and breaking/stretching can only be fully examined
by statistically valid repetition.
The last explanation (4) may not only clarify the differ¬
ences in the stiffness at different strain rates but also
explain the lack of a direct parallel between ossicle mass
ratios, degree of flexibility and stiffness. Even if it
is assumed that the soft tissue components of each species
skeletal system are the same, the relative volume of any
1 type of soft tissue (e.g. ligament, muscle) to ossicle
volume and the organization of the soft tissue around the
ossicles differs greatly. An extensionin one species may be lim¬
ited by ligament while in another species muscle may be the
limiting factor. These differences may account for the
variety of k and Eg values calculated in previous equations.
Further experiments should be done to clarify this
situation. Both tensile and shear stress-strain curves
need to be determined at many more strain rates and percent
strains for a larger number of individuals. Further ana¬
tomical and histological examinations would be invaluable.
Nevertheless, these experiments do show that flexibility
and stiffness are related to ossicle mass. It is also
