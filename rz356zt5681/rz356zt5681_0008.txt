is half that of other bends due to the greater height
of the arm (greater arm cross-sectional area) and the
large sturdy ossicles found on the proximal aboral surface.
The greater arm cross-sectional area would need a greater
stress to show the same strain. The may be responsible
for Patiria's general inflexibility. The aboral ossicles
are large enough to effect aboral flection in the same way
that the lateral ossicles in Pycnopodia effect lateral
bend in that species.
A rough prediction of flexibility can be computed
from the ratios of ossicle mass to total mass. Using the
relationship of density, mass and volume, these mass ratios
can be expressed as volume fraction ratios. If the density
of soft tissue is approximately 14 and the density of ossicles
is 2.6 g cm (Jones '70 as cited by Koehl 182), the
ratio of ossicle volume to total volume (the ossicle
volume fraction, Vpo) is
Vo  OM 1 2.6 q cm
Vro - Vr
2.6 g om total massl m
This equation yields values of ossicle volume fraction of
.016 for Pycnopodia, .064 for Pisaster, and .068 for Patiria.
(These values normalize to a 1:4:4.25 ratio for the 3
species). The Young's modulus of ossicle Caco, is approxiÂ¬
mately 137 GN m (Wainwright et al '76) making it very
inextensible in comparison to the soft tissues likely to
be found in the arm, such as ligament, muscle, connective
tissue, and epidermis, which have Young's moduli between
10* and 102 N m (Wainwright '76). Thus as the volume
