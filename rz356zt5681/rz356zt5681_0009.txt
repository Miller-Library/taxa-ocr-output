If, however, the volume fraction of ossicles is O, the

The extension experienced by the bending arm as a whole is

where 1/R is equal to flexibility. This shows that the
greater the volume fraction of ossicles, the larger the
radius of bending and the smaller the flexibility. If
the k values are the same among the 3 species, the radii
of bending will have the same 1:4:4.25 ratio as the ossicle
volume fractions. This ratio is not experimentally observed
(table 3) implying that the k values differ. It should,
however, be noted that the experimental results are qualitaÂ¬
tively correct: the greater the ossicle volume fraction,
the less the flexibility. Using an average r value of 2.8
cm and the observed radius of curvature (oral flection)
the k values can be computed using the formula
