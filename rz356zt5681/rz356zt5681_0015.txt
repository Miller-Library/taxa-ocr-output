Figure 1. Starfish obstacle tank. Eleven PVC pipes
with radii ranging from 1 cm to 5 cm. Used for
behavioral observations.
Figure 2. Starfish skeleton stretching machine. Force
and deformation were measured for aboral skeletal
patches to determine stress-strain curves,
Figure 3. Beam theory extension. Engineering model
to relate surface extension to radius of curvature.
Figure 4. Ossicle morphology. Ambulacral and aboral
skeletal systems are illustrated. P-proximal; D=
distal; AB=aboral; O-oral.
Figure 5. Stress-strain curves. Low plastic flow at
low strain rate. Pathway represents extension and relaxation.
Figure 6. Stress-strain curves. High plastic flow (502)
at high strain rate. Pathway represents extension
and relaxation.
Figure 7. Mathematical relation of extension and ossicle
volume fraction.
