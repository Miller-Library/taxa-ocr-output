Tansey
(relaxation) represents the average of 3 tests. At the
higher strain rate, considerable plastic flow is observed.
(20% in Pisaster, 40% in Patiria and 50% in Pycnopodia.)
At the lower strain rate, plastic flow is less (20% in Pisaster,
0% in Patiria, and 0% in Pycnopodia). Naturally occurring
strain is calculated (as described in materials and methods)
to be 0.28. Young's modulus was calculated for each extension
using this natural strain and the corresponding stress.
Patiria is stiffest at the higher & (3 times as stiff as
at the lower 6mp). Pisaster and Pycnopodia are stiffer
in the slower test than in the faster test (Pisaster 5
times as much).
Discussion
The comparative analysis of the 3 species in this
study revealed a relation between skeletal anatomy, mechaniÂ¬
cal properties and flexibility. Is there a mechanistic
basis for this relationship?
The differences in organization of ossicles among
species can be used to explain the results obtained from
the manual deformation of relaxed starfish. Pycnopodia
is only half as flexible in a lateral bend as in either an
oral or aboral direction. This fact can be explained by
the presence of the 2 lateral rows of ossicles on either
side of the ambulacral ossicles. When compressed, these
ossicles jam into each other to form a solid rigid unit
that resists further compression. Patiria's aboral flection
