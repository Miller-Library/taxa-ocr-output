where X is extension, ris the distance from the neutral
axis (fig. 3) to the surface undergoing tension of compressive
stress, and R is the radius to which the arm is bent

Ossicle Anatomy
The starfish skeletal system has been illustrated
elsewhere (Eylers '76, Heddle '67) for other species.
Both the ambulacral and aboral skeletal systems for the
3 species examined here are pictured in figure 4. The
ambulacral systems are similar in the species if the 2
rows of plate-like ossicles next to the ambulacral ossicles
in Pycnopodia are considered part of the aboral skeleton.
The aboral "lattice-work" structure in Patiria and Pisaster
differs greatly from the scattered spines in Pycnopodia,
but upon closer examination it is seen that even the 2
"lattice-work" structures are basically different. Patiria
has a flat, 2-dimensional shingle-like form; the anchored
ends of each ossicle being covered by the exposed portion
of the ossicles immediately below it (more oral).
Pisaster has a complex 3-dimensional lattice composed of
small irregularly shaped ossicles anchored together like
