Tansey
and material properties of 3 species of intertidal starfish;
2ycnopodia helianthoides,Pisaster ochraceus, and Patiria
miniata,on their flexibility. These species were chosen
because of their differing habitats, morphologies and behaviors.
Materials and Methods
Ossicle Anatomy
Starfish of the above species were collected from
Monterey Bay, California and kept in seatable tanks at
Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Ca. Patiria and
Pisaster of a typical size (130 and 170 g respectively)
and small to medium size Pycnopodia (260 g) were used for a
preliminary ossicle morphology examination. The animals
were first relaxed in a solution of 50% sea water and 50%
magnesium chloride solution (70 g Mgcl in 1 1. H,O)
(Heddle '67) then cleaned of soft tissue in a solution of
one-third household bleach (active ingredient 5.25% sodium
hypochlorite) and two-thirds sea water for 2-4 hours. An
examination was made of the individual ossicles and their
organization.
Flexibility
Flexibility experiments were performed on instarfish
of each species; the anus to arm tip lengths of which were
recorded. The starfish were relaxed in the Mgcl solution
for over 12 hours, then manually deformed around glass
tubing with radii ranging from 1.5 mm to 5.6 cm. MeasureÂ¬
ments of the minimum radius to which each could bend were
-2-
