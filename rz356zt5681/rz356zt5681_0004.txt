entiated transducer (LVDT) on the anchored plate. Deforma¬
tion of the sample was monitored by a LVDT mounted on the moving
plate. The voltage output of each LVDT was recorded on
a chart recorder. The machine could measure strain up to
40% and stress up to.85 N.
The 18 aboral patches (6 from each species) were removed
from starfish that had been relaxed in Mgcl and cut into
hourglass shapes with a rectangular center sections.
The volumes of the center sections were calculated from meas¬
ured length, width and thickness. For the sake of numerical
convenience, the length was kept at a constant 5 mm for all
tests. Volumes varied between 7 x 10"0 m2 and 3.6 x 10' m
for the 18 patches. Assuming the sample to be isovolumetric,
a new cross-sectional area was determined at each strain.
Stress (0) and strain (8) could then be calculated.

These stress-strain curves were determined at 2 different
strain rates (strain rate is £ - 8/unit time): £ - 3.5 x 10 "
(elapsed time = 96 sec) and £ = 2,8 x 10  sec

(elapses time = 12 sec). 3 trials were run for each species
at each strain rate. Young's moduli were then calculated
from the slope of a plot averaged for the 3 trials. Young's
modulus is the stress at a natural strain divided by
that natural strain. The strains observed in nature
