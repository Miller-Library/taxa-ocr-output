taken for a lateral bend, an oral flection and an aboral
flection. The radius of curvature was then normalized to
the arm length.
An obstacle tank (fig. 1) was constructed to observe
natural bending behavior. 11 PVC pipes of radii ranging
from 1 cm to 5.5 cm were attached to the bottom and sides
of the concrete tank with marine epoxy. Natural bending
around the pipes was observed in 12 starfish; 6 Patiria
4 Pisaster, and 2 Pycnopodia. Bending was also induced
by manually setting the starfish on or against various
pipes. The starfish were also manually inverted so that
righting behavior could be observed.
Material Properties
The ratio of dry ossicle mass to total wet mass was
determined for a single arm of 1 individual of each species.
After the arms were removed from the animals and soaked
in 50% NaoH (Eylers '76) to remove soft tissue, the ossicles
were separated, dried with a heat lamp, and weighed.
The stress-strain relationships were determined for
patches of aboral skeleton (the more interspecifically
varied of the 2 sybsystems) for each species. These stress¬
strain curves were determined from the data yielded by the
starfish skeleton stretching machine (fig. 2) The test
sample was clamped between a clamp mounted on an anchored
double cantilever beam and a clamp mounted on a plate moved
by a lead screw. Force was sensed by deflection of the
double beam and was monitored by a linearly variable differ¬
