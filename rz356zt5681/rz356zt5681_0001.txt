Abstract
The skeletal system in starfish greatly influences behavior
and ecology. Locomotory behavior, especially aspects of flex¬
iblity, is dependent on the properties of the skeletal system.
Anatomical and mechanical properties are here examined to
determine the relationship of ossicle mass, material stiffness,
and flexibility. Flexibility behavior is also observed to
examine the range of degree and rate of bending among the3
subject species. It is concluded that a) The greater the
volume fraction of ossicles, the stiffer the tissue and b) The
greater the volume fraction of ossicles, the lesser the flex¬
ibility. It is also found that rate of flection varies more
among the species than does the degree of flexibility.
Introduction
Much of starfish behavior is influenced by the skeletal
system. This effect has been studied in feeding on bivalves
(Eylers '76) and in burrowing behavior (Heddle '67). The
effect of skeletal structure on flexibility, however, has not
been examined. The ability to survive on a complex 3-dimen¬
sional rocky coastline with wave action, predators, tides and
varying food sources is probably in part a function of flex¬
ibility. Sturdiness would benefit an intertidal starfish
that deals with constant compressive wave forces while good
flexibility allows movement in a greater variety of micro¬
habitats (crevices and open faces) giving greater access
to a greater number of prey and hiding places. This study
was undertaken to examine the effect of anatomical and
