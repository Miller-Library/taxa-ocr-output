The greater the ossicle volume fraction, the greater the
Young's modulus. If the Eg values are the same among the
species, the total stiffness will be directly proportional
to the ossicle volume fraction. An exact ratio is not
observed in the data implying different Eg values for
the species. It should again be noted that while the data
didn't perfectly conform to expectations, it still reflected
the general trend that the greater ossicle volume fraction, the
greater the stiffness. Using E values from the faster
strain test, approximate Eg values can be calculated using
the formula

as 6.1 x 10° N m"4 for Pycnopodia, 1.6 x 10 Nm2 for
Pisaster, and 1.3 x 10° N m4 for Patiria.
Any relation between stiffness and flexibility in these
experiments is not clear. The major factor of confusion
is the change of stiffness with strain rate. Pycnopodia
is approximately equally stiff at both strain rates.
Patiria is 3 times stiffer at the faster strain rate;
Pisaster is 5 times stiffer at the slower strain rate,
Four possible explanations can be set forth.
1) Individual differences among members of the same
species may be reponsible. Different individual starfish
were used in Pisaster and Patiria for the 2 different strain
rates.
2) There may exist an optimal strain rate for each
species where the value of stiffness is lowest. If so,
the stiffnesses recorded here represent only 2 points on
