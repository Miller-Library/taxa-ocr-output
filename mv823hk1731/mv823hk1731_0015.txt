indicate nearby food particles (Mangum and Cox 1971). It is likely that D. ornata senses
the presence of food in the water in a similar fashion. The commonly observed D. ornata
behavior of waiting at the opening of the tube cap with tentacles waving is probably the
way in which the worm moves the water through their tubes.
A study of Harmothoe imbricata revealed that either the palps or the cirri are able
determine the location of vibrations in the water. In addition, the palps contain
chemoreceptors that transmit chemical information, allowing the worm to determine if
the vibration was caused by food or a predator (Daly 1973). The sensory appendages of
D, ornata may have similar abilities and could be at least partially responsible for the
ability of D. ornata to determine sense the presence of food nearby in the water.
Other species of polychaetes are similar to D. ornata in that they will not leave
their tubes completely to feed. For example, nereid worms reach from their tubes to grab
food, but have not been observed to extend more than one-third of their body length to
feed (Clark 1959). Nereis virens burrows into the sand and moves to a position closer to
the food, if it could not reach the food from the tube (Clark 1959). This behavior has not
been observed in D. ornata.
Activity Patterns:
D. ornata's day and night activity patterns (limited activity during the day and
tube building or remodeling at night) suggest that the worm may be able to sense light
and exhibits a photonegative response, as seen with other polychaetes. Studies on
Nephtys show that the worms preferred the dark half of the water dish. In addition, these
worms swam more frequently in lighter conditions, presumably looking for a place to
