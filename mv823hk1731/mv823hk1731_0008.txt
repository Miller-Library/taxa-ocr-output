Tube recognition:
Diopatra ornata does not immediately plant its tube cap into the substrate when
inserted into a new tube or back into its original tube. After two days, however, two of
the seven worms put into new tubes had planted the tubes and two of the worms had
constructed new tubes. Two of the seven worms put back into their original tubes also
planted their tubes after two days and again two worms constructed new tubes (Fig. 2 and
3). In one unusual case, a worm placed in a new tube created a hole into the side of the
old tube (lying horizontally on the sand) and built the buried portion of its tube
perpendicularly beneath the old tube.
Tube building and tube structure:
Tube caps of Diopatra ornata are always bent towards the substrate, with the
aperture approximately one centimeter above the sand (Table 1). If the curved portion of
the tube cap is cut, the worm adds to the existing tube cap, using surrounding sand and
shells, until the tube opening is once again approximately a centimeter above the sand.
D. ornata decorate and fortify their tubes caps with extra layers of sand, shells,
and pieces of kelp. They pick up the shell (or piece of kelp) with their jaws, and then the
shell sticks to the ventral surface of their body, just below the jaws. They then bring the
shell back to the tube cap opening and hold the shell in the desired location. The secreted
mucus allows the shell to stick to the tube cap, and the worm quickly pulls away from the
shell, leaving it attached to the tube cap. The distance a worm reaches for a piece of kelp
or a shell depends on the length of the worm. They do reach for shells farther than
immediately under their tube, but the worms never fully leave the tube. D. ornata attach
