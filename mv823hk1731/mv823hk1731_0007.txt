the species that co-exist with D. ornata, but this listis by no means inclusive of all the
species living in the D. ornata beds.
Locomotion:
Diopatra ornata do not leave their tubes unles forced to do so. They are able to
quickly move up and dovn their tubes and extend from the tube cap seither to catch prey
or to grab building material for the tube cap). To move up and down in the tube, the
worm relies on parapodia to crawl along the sides of the tube. The worm can extend out
of the tube cap and then quickly withdraw by contracting the tail segments suddenly and
forcefully. The secretions from the ventral surface of the worm allow the worm to
slichtly side within the tube and aid in the worm's ability to hang from the tube cap. imn
adition, small setae grasp the inner wall ofthe tube, making it easier for the wormn to
stay inside the tube. It is difficult to dislodge a D. ornata from its tube, even when the
tube is held vertically upside down.
When Diopatra ornata is manually dislodged from its tube, the worm thrashes
back and forth untilit has landed on the sand. Once on the sand, the worm quickly digs a
hole by pushing the sand aside with its head. The worm enters the growing hole head first
and then pulls istailend into the hole in spurts. Fist,it pulsome of its tail into the hole
and then digs farther before pulling more of its tail into the hole.The worm completely
buries itself before constructing a new tube cap. The entire burowing proces only takes
a few minutes and is started as soon as the worm finds a suitable substrate.
