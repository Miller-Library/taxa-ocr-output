The worms were gently displaced from their tubes with tweezers, and they crawled into
the new tubes when their heads were pointed inside the tube openings. After 2 days, the
worms were observed to see if they had planted the tube into the sand or constructed a
new tube.
To measure the rate of tube building, 5 tube caps with worms were laid out
horizontally on the sand. After a period of 24 hours, each tube was excavated and the
length of new tube was recorded. This experiment was repeated twice.
Shell fragments were placed 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm away from occupied tubes to
test how far the worms would extend from their tubes to collect shell material for their
tube caps. The tendency to build curved tube cap openings was also tested by cutting
back 26 occupied tube caps, leaving the tube caps sticking straight up with no curvature,
and then allowing the worms to rebuild their tube cap. The distance from the tube cap to
the substrate was measured both before the tube caps were cut back and after the worm
had reconstructed the tube cap. The average of these distances was calculated and
assumed to be D. ornata 's preferred distance from the substrate.
Tube deterioration was examined by leaving unoccupied tubes in a tank supplied
with running seawater. The quality of the tube structure was compared to those tubes
occupied with worms (in the aquariums) by testing qualitatively for stiffness. The
interiors of the tubes were also compared by cutting the tubes open and examining them
visually.
The day/ night activity patterns were recorded using time-lapse video of the
activities of 3 worms over a course of 3 days. The recording speed was such that 4
