the tube cap, yet remain hidden from passing predators. The curved tube may also assist
in catching food particles, such as algae, that float by the tube.
Diopatra ornata are extremely adept at quickly constructing new tubes or
repairing damaged tubes. This ability suggests that they might have to abandon or repair
their tubes frequently in nature. Their tube beds appear to be stable, but this stability may
be more the result of the worm’s quick building skills than a lack of environmental
disturbances.
Feeding:
There are several species of tube-dwelling polychaetes that live off the central
California coast. Many of these polychaetes, including the serpulids, the sabellids, the
sabellariids, and the chaetopterids, are suspension feeders. These worms show little
activity compared to Diopatra. The chaetopterids, for example, obtain food by filtering
the surrounding water through a mucus bag (Barnes 1965). Öther less active polychaetes
include the terrebellids, which are deposit feeders. However, Diopatra ornata are much
more active, raptorial feeders with powerful jaws, despite living in permanent tubes.
Their major food source is the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (Kim 1992). However,
worms from the family Onuphidae (includes D. ornata) often catch small invertebrates
for food.
Some worms periodically move large amounts of water through their tubes, in an
attempt to obtain more oxygen from the water. Diopatra cuprea, however, does not
withdraw much oxygen during respiration, and therefore may be using this "tube
irrigation" primarily as a way of checking the surrounding water for chemicals that may
