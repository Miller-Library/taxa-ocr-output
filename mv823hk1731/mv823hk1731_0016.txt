bury into the sand, and did bury themselves faster, if given the opportunity (Clark 1956).
D. ornata may similarly stay in their tubes during the day and primarily make tube
additions at night in an attempt to avoid the light. The worms may also be building at
night in order to avoid day-time predators, such as the benthic sand-dab fish.
Further directions:
There are still several questions surrounding the behavior and biology of Diopatra
ornata. For example, it is known that some tube-dwelling polychaetes leave their tubes
and go to the surface of the water to reproduce, while others breed in their tubes.
However, the reproductive behavior of D. ornata is not completely understood.
Conclusions:
Diopatra ornata, a little studied species of polychaete, is able to construct
elaborate tubes, made of sand, mucus, and pieces of kelp and shells. They build the
underground segments of their tubes, averaging 4 cm a day, and prefer to keep the
apertures of their tube caps approximately 1 cm from the substrate. They have been
shown to be able to regenerate anterior or posterior parts, though they may need to be in
their tubes in order to do so. They seem to be able to sense the presence of nearby food,
and feed by grabbing the food and quickly bringing it back to the tube. They move within
the tube using their small parapodia and setae, but also have the ability to suddenly
withdraw into the tube with a quick contraction of their longitudinal muscles. D. ornata
most actively add to their tubes at night, possibly in an attempt to avoid light.
