Introduction:
Diopatra ornata is member of the family Onuphidae (class Polychaeta, phylum
Annelida). The majority of onuphids are tube-dwelling worms. Their body sizes range
from a few millimeters to a few meters long and tend to be cylindrical and widest at the
anterior (head) end (Rouse and Pleijel 1999). Onuphids are found throughout the world,
in habitats ranging from the intertidal to the abyssal depths. D. ornata is commonly found
in subtidal regions of California and Mexico.
Polychaetes ("many setae") are characterized by distinct segments bearing a
lateral pair of paddle-like parapodia, each with many bristles called setae (Levinton
2001). The setae of Diopatra ornata are hooked and have eight teeth. The well-developed
sensory appendages located on the head end of D. ornata consist of three anterior
antennae and two palps. The jaws, on the ventral side, have smaller toothed plates and a
pair of curved tongs, and the pharynx is a ventral muscular proboscis (Rouse and Pleijel
1999). Several of the anterior segments have elaborate feathery gills. Lining the
epidermal epithelium are mucus-secreting glands, and below the epithelium lie the
circular muscle fibers and the longitudinal muscle fibers. D. ornata are a dull gray color
with a iridescent cuticle (Moore 1911).
D. ornata build tubes constructed of chitin, sand, pieces of kelp, and shells, held
together by layers of mucus. These tubes are planted into the sand with thin segments
under the sand, extending as far as a meter long, as well as elaborate hard, membraneous
tube caps above the substrate (Fig. 1). D. ornata tubes form dense mats and cover the
sand bordering kelp beds.
