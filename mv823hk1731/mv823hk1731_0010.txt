Feeding:
Diopatra ornata does not fully leave its tube but reaches several centimeters from
its tube cap to capture passing food. When food was put into the aquarium, the worms
showed increased tentacle movement and extended their heads out of the tube. However,
when a plastic ruler was put into the aquarium, a worm only came out of its tube if it was
directly disturbed. This difference in behavior suggests that D. ornata can sense when
food is nearby, possibly using chemoreceptors. The worm reaches out to the food,
captures the food with its jaws and anterior parapodia and then retreats quickly with the
food back into its tube cap. If the food needs to be freed from something it is attached to,
for example, the tube of another worm, the worm chews on the food until it can pull the
food back into its tube cap. Neighboring D. ornata worms may work together on the
same piece of food until they have each freed a segment to take back into their tube.
Activity Patterns:
Diopatra ornata is consistent in its day/ night activity patterns. During the day,
the worms wait at the aperture of their tube caps in their typical feeding posture with their
tentacles waving just slightly outside of the tube. At night is when the worms make
necessary additions to their tubes and tube caps (Table 2).
Regeneration:
Both anterior segments and posterior segments have been known to regenerate,
though no new heads were regenerated in the time of this experiment. Tail segments left
exposed to the outside sea water (not in a tube of any kind) quickly died and decomposed
