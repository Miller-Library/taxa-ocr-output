Settling in dense patches may have other advantages for the worms. For example,
the dense patches may offer them more protection from some predators. Other predators,
however, may take advantage of the dense Diopatra beds. In addition, sometimes the
worms feed from the kelp attached to the backs of other worms' tubes, and therefore the
dense patches would create an opportunity for more food.
Locomotion:
The method in which Spiochaetopterus oculatus moves up and down inside its
tube has been studied in great detail (Barnes 1964). This worm crawls headfirst by
pushing its notopodia against the tube wall, one side at a time. To back down the tube, the
worm slowly releases contact with the tube wall and slides down. Like D. ornata, S.
oculatus can turn around inside its tube. The worm turns around by moving its head end
down the tube, between the wall and the tail end (which is moving up the tube at the
same time) (Barnes 1964). D. ornata was observed exhibiting the same behavior inside a
clear plastic straw.
Many tube-dwelling polychaetes are able to suddenly withdraw into their tubes.
The nereids accomplish this " defense response" by quick contraction of the longitudinal
muscles (Clark 1959). D. ornata also exhibit this response, though it is most commonly
observed when the worm is bringing food back into its tube, and it is likely that the
longitudinal muscles of D. ornata also allow for the quick withdrawal.
