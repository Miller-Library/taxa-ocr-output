Little information has been published about Diopatra ornata. This paper
examines aspects of their behavior, in particular the way in which they construct their
elaborate tubes.
Materials and Methods:
Diopatra ornata used in this study were collected from the sand bordering the
kelp beds outside of Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey, CA. Animals were collected
with intact tube caps but only 10-15 cm of the subsurface portions of their tubes. They
were transported back to Hopkins Marine Station, where they were housed in five
separate 40-liter aquariums. Four of these aquariums were half-filled with beach sand,
and the fifth aquarium was half-filled with fine grade glass beads. All aquariums had à
supply of running seawater.
Density counts were performed in the field by counting the number of tube caps
in a 0.0625 m’ plot. Samples were taken from 0.25 m’ plots and the different species
present in that area were noted.
Observations of locomotion were done by watching the worms' behaviors in their
tubes. In addition, locomotion observations were made for 2 worms placed in to clear
plastic straws.
A high percentage of tubes in the field are occupied. This suggests that D. orndtd
do move into tubes previously occupied by a different worm. To test the worm's ability
to recognize its own tube and the tendency of a worm to settle in a different worm's tube,
and plant that tube upright, Idisplaced 10 worms from their original tubes and placed 3
of them in unoccupied tubes made by another worm and 5 back into their original tubes.
