Tube Recognition:
It is still unclear whether D. ornata will inhabit vacant tubes constructed by other
worms. All the worms displaced from their tubes and left on the sand quickly built a new
tube and did not try to find an empty tube. In addition, 4 of the worms transplanted
during the recognition experiment built new tubes.
Tube building and tube structure:
There are many possible explanations for why D. ornata and several other species
of tube-dwelling worms make such elaborate additions to their tube caps (shells, kelp,
etc), G.A. Brenchley (1976) suggested that the tube cap decorations might allow the
worm to easily sense water motion caused by approaching predators. Worms in more
heavily ornamented tubes were able to easily distinguish between small water
disturbances, as might be caused by drift algae, and larger disturbances, as might be
caused by potential predators. The worm can therefore detect whether the water
disturbance is due to a predator or a food source and then behave accordingly. Worms in
less heavily ornamented tubes did not show a significant difference in their responses to
the different levels of water disturbance (Brenchley 1976). Another possible explanation
is that the shells and kelp may provide a habitat for small invertebrates that the D. ornata
Ã§an later catch as food. In addition, the tube caps may serve as protection for the worm,
though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.
Diopatra ornata tube caps are always curved, and this orientation allows the
worms to wait in the front of their tubes, with their tentacles waving out the opening of
