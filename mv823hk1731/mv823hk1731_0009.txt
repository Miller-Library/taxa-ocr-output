extra layers of sand to their tube caps in a similar fashion, by gathering sand on to their
ventral surface and then attaching it to the tube cap.
If the tube is excavated and/or damaged, Diopatra ornata repair them quickly,
adding on approximately 4 centimeters underground over the course of one day as well as
adding about 3 centimeters to the tube cap (Table 1). D. ornata always orient their tubes
up with a curved cap and quickly plant the tubes in this manner if their tubes are
excavated from the sand. To plant an already constructed tube cap, the worm first buries
the back end of the tube and builds some of the tube under the sand. The worm then pulls
the tube cap partly into the sand and continues to attempt to stand the tube up by
emerging from the aperture and pushing against the substrate, levering the curved portion
of the tube cap into an upright position. The worm continues this pulling and pushing
until the tube is fully upright and stable. If the previously buried segment of the tube is
still attached to the tube cap, the worm chews off that segment and starts building a new
tube segment under the sand (attached to the tube cap).
D. ornata tubes kept without worms become more flimsy and flexible over Ã 
period of one week. This alteration suggests that the worms do maintain the rigidness of
their tubes, perhaps by continually secreting layers of chitin to the inside of the tubes. D.
ornata also keeps the inside of its tube clean of sand and excrement, by dragging sand
and fecal pellets to the top of its tube and then pushing it out of the tube cap with its
anterior parapodia.
