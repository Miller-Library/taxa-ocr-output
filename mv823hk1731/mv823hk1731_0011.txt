(in 2 days). Tail segments put in natural or plastic tubes lasted longer without
decomposing, suggesting that the necessity of the tube for regeneration. However, after
22 days, the worms segments in plastic straws showed no signs of regeneration and had
begun to decompose. One head segment found without any tail segments did not rebuild
a tube and quickly decomposed. Heads with at least 10 tail segments were easily able to
rebuild tubes and tube caps, though the tube caps were always substantially smaller than
those built by intact worms. Worms with tail segments loose in their tubes often
discarded those segments by pushing them out the tube cap opening.
Discussion:
Density:
Mangum et al. (1968) found that the density of Diopatra cupred was correlated
with current velocity: at higher current velocities, there was a higher density of D.
cuprea. A possible explanation for this correlation is that the higher current speed allows
the worm to come into contact with more water from which it can extract oxygen.
However, D. cuprea is able to create its own small current by beating its antennae and
most likely comes into contact with just enough oxygen-rich water from this"tube
irrigation." The study suggested that the high current velocity was important because it
meant that more water would flow by the tube cap, and therefore more food was likely to
get caught on the hook of the tube cap (Mangum et al. 1968). When the tube cap
densities of D. ornata were recorded, no measurement of current velocity was noted, but
the same correlation may exist.
