minutes of real time was recorded on to 1 second of film (240 times faster than real time).
The time-lapse video was also crucial in making many of the behavioral observations.
Diopatra ornata have fragile bodies that often fragment during collection. Like
many other polychaetes, this fragmentation is due to the worm's tendency to
spontaneously autotomize. Many of the segments obtained during collection were kept in
order to test the worm’s ability to regenerate lost segments. These regeneration
experiments were performed in a tank with sand and running seawater. The worm
segments were kept either in a petri dish, in a clear plastic straw, or on the sand. Survival
and evidence for regeneration were monitored for 22 days.

Density and Neighbors:
Tube beds of Diopatra ornata form dense patches in subtidal kelp beds. Densities
range from 4 to 17 tube caps per 0.0625 m’, with an average of 10.69 tube caps (Table 1).
When excavated individuals were allowed to replant their tubes in an aquarium, D.
ornata planted their tubes at least one centimeter from their neighbors, and never with the
tube cap openings facing each other. The densest patch of D. ornata tubes observed in the
aquarium contained 8 tube caps in a 100 cm plot.
Other polychaete species found in the D. ornata beds include Nothria elegans,
Nothria iridescens, a terebellid, Halosydna brevisetosa, a maldanid, and a phyllodocid.
Other species found in these beds include several species of snails, crabs, red algae, and
unattached drift kelp (Macrocystis). The purpose of this sampling was to collect some of
