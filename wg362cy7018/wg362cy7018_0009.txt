investigation of zinc permeation through TRPM7 may help us understand how zinc levels in the
brain become imbalanced, especially once stable transfects of normal human TRPM7 and
Guamanian mutant TRPM7 exist. Establishing the relative magnitudes of physiological divalent
effects on metal permeation will help elucidate the mechanism of TRPM7 trace metal transport.
