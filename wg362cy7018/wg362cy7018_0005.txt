continued until 75 frames. Between each experiment, image was refocused. All experiments
took place within 3 hours of start of dye loading procedure.
Experimental design - For each of the four Ca“Mg“ buffer types, induced and uninduced
(control) chips were tested. Three tests were performed on each chip. First, the same non-zinc
solution was perfused. This was a negative control. Second, 100 uM Zn* was added while
keeping [Ca“ and [Mg* constant. Then, 10 uM pyrithione mixed with the 100 uM Zn2
solution was added in order to determine the cells' maximum fluorescence (Fyay).
Data analysis - For each chip, 6 cells were chosen from the visual field that exemplified the
criteria stated earlier when selecting cells for imaging, were clearly visible, and did not move
during perfusion. In Fluo View, distinct areas were drawn around each cell, resulting in a table of
fluorescence values for each cell. The same cells that were used in a zinc addition analysis were
used in the subsequent pyrithione addition analysis. An Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA)
macro was created to prepare the data for analysis with Igor Pro (v. 4.09A Carbon)
(WaveMetrics, Lake Öswego, OR). In Igor, the average of the fluorescence values for the last 5
frames of the pyrithione experiment for each cell was used as each cell's Fyax. The fluorescence
over time during the addition of zinc for each cell was divided by the Fyxx, to produce 6 AF/F
graphs. The average of the first 10 values of each of the 6 graphs was calculated; this average
represented the baseline for each cell, since nothing was perfused over the first 10 graphs in any
experiment. The AF/F graphs were divided by their respective averages, and these normalized
graphs were averaged to produce a single graph. Thus, for each chip, the average represents an n
of 6.
