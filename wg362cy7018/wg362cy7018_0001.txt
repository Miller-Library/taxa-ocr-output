Abstract
Zinc is an essential metabolic heavy metal in all cells. Zinc imbalances in the brain are
considered a cause of neurodegenerative disorders. A member of the TRPM cation channel
family, TRPM7 is a widely-expressed outwardly-rectifying Ca2 and Mg2 channel through
which trace metal ions like Zn“ flow into cells. TRPM7 Ca2 permeation may be essential for
cell viability. While previous characterizations of Zn* permeation involved mM levels of Zinc,
here we show that TRPM7 is the dominant Zn“ pathway in HEK-293 cells at 100 uM Zn2. We
performed confocal microscope imaging experiments with the Zn“-binding fluorophore
FluoZin-3 AM. In the presence of 100 uM Zn“, HEK-293 cells overexpressing murine TRPM7
load Zn“ almost 20% more than normal HEK-293 cells. Data for experiments in the presence of
physiological levels of Ca“ and Mg“ were compared to data for experiments performed in the
absence of Ca“ and Mg“, indicating that the presence of 2 mM Ca2 and 2 mM Mg2 inhibited
Zn? influx.
