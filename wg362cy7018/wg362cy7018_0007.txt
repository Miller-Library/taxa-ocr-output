Discussion
As mentioned before, the results for experiments where only magnesium was present or
where only calcium was present (0,2 and 2,0) are considered preliminary. Both ions,
respectively, seemed to have inhibitory effects on zinc loading, and further experiments should
reveal the relative magnitude of each ion's effect.
The 2,2 and 0,0 data are more useful, especially because induced and uninduced cells
from both buffer types can be compared. Also, experiments were performed at almost the exact
same time after dye loading, so the higher fluorescence increases seen in the 0,0 data are not
likely due to additional dye loading and de-esterification/activation over time. Induced cells
fluoresced an average of almost 20% more in the absence of Mg“ and Ca" than in the presence
of the two ions. A difference in fluorescence levels after Zn“ addition is seen between
uninduced cells in 0,0 and uninduced cells in 2,2 because HEK-293 cells express normal levels
of TRPM7, and because TRPM7 is not the only Zn* influx pathway. Since the only difference
between the 0,0 and 2,2 experiments is in the buffer ion concentrations, and since overexpression
of TRPM7 is the only difference between induced cells and uninduced cells (Monteilh-Zoller et
al., 2003), Ca“ and Mg“ must be having an effect on Zn* movement through TRPM7.
One explanation for the difference between 0,0 and 2,2 data is that the additional
divalents competitively interfered with Zn“ binding and transport across and through the
TRPM7 channel. This may have occurred, though Zn“ has been found to have high
permeability relative to Mg2t and even higher permeability relative to Ca“ through TRPM7
(Monteilh-Zoller et al., 2003). The Monteilh-Zoller et al. findings in turn may not be applicable
to our study, since 10 mM Zn“ was used in that experiment, whereas we used 100 uM Zn“. A
more likely explanation is that TRPM7 is regulated by intracellular Mg-ATP (Nadler et al., 2001)
