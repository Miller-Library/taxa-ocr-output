appropriate buffer. Approximately 0.3 g of glucose was added to each 50 mL tube of solution.
In order to make 10 uM pyrithione solutions, 5 uL of 10 mM pyrithione was mixed with 5 mL of
the appropriate buffer (+ 100 uM Zn**) immediately before use. Pyrithione is a selective Zn’
ionophore (Sensi et al., 1997). All solutions were heated to 35 °C.
Dye loading - Chips were placed in clean 35 mM Petri dishes containing -1.5 mL of warm non-
zinc test buffer. 5 uL FluoZin-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 5 uM dilution in
DMSO was added. Dishes were rotated for 40 minutes. Chips were then placed in fresh Petri
dishes containing -1.5 mL (fresh) of the same buffer and rotated for 5 minutes. Chips not being
used were kept in the dark.
Imaging via confocal microscopy - Identical Plexiglas chambers were designed and milled. A
chip was attached with high vacuum grease to the bottom of a chamber containing the starting
solution. A f2 cover slip was greased in place. The chamber was placed on the confocal stage,
which was controlled at 30.0 °C. An Olympus (Melville, NY) UPlanFL 20X lens was used.
Cells were selected based on the following criteria: not too many processes, relatively round in
shape, separated from confluent masses, and if possible, not touching any other cells. Zoom in
FluoView Physiology/TIEMPO/Beta software (Olympus) was 2X. Laser intensity was set to
1.5, and confocal aperture was set to 2 on the Olympus FluoView 300 microscope. For all
experiments, 75 frames were captured at 2.8 sec/frame, at a resolution of 512x512. For frames
0-10, nothing was perfused (baseline). At frame -6, suction was switched on. At frame 10,
either 4 mL warm test solution, or 5 mL pyrithione mix was pipetted by hand onto chamber.
This was usually finished around frames 24-28. Suction was switched off, and recording
