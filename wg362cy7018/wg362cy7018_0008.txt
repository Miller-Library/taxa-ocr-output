or even free Mg“ (Kozak and Cahalan, 2003). Cells bathing for up to -2.5 hours in 2 mM Mg?
would likely have higher intracellular levels of Mg-ATP or free Mg* than cells bathing in 0 mM
Mg“, and would thus show an increased inhibition of TRPM7 activity.
However, based on the preliminary 2,0 data (shown) and other preliminary 2,0
experiments (data not shown), it seems that Ca“ alone does have a negative effect on Zn’
permeation. We speculate that intracellular Ca“ may promote PLC activity and resultant
TRPM7 inhibition via PIP, hydrolysis (Runnels et al., 2002), or that extracellular Ca’t may
significantly interfere with zinc binding to TRPM7 at 100 uM Zn2. Besides collecting more
meaningful data from better 2,0 experiments, in future 0,2 and 0,0 tests we will also loaded cells
with BAPTA AM, a strong Ca“ chelator. Comparing a non-BAPTA 0,2 experiment with a
BAPTA 0,2 experiment will further elucidate calcium’s effects on Zn’ TRPM7 permeation,
since even in 0 mM Ca“ there is some intracellular Ca2t.
Also, the only missing piece of information necessary to calculate the actual ion
concentration at any given time is the Fyny. This value will be determined by treating cells with
TPEN (Sensi et al., 1997). Finally, since the [Zn’ we used was 100 uM, and since
physiological levels are closer to 10 uM (Perveen et al., 2002), it will also be important to
examine 10 uM Zn“ permeation.
Conclusions
This study shows that cells overexpressing TRPM7 load Zn’ more than cells with normal
expression of TRPM7, supporting the claim that TRPM7 is the dominant pathway for Zn“
movement into cells. This study also shows that Ca“ and Mg“ inhibit Zn“ movement through
TRPM7. Further experiments will be necessary to determine just how effective Ca“ and Mg-
are at inhibition of Zn“ permeation at physiological concentrations. Ultimately, thorough
