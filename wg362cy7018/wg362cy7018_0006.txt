Results
Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the raw imaging data, with an artificial lookup table applied.
The results for 2 mM Ca“,0 mM Mg2“, O uM Zn2 (hereafter indicated as 2,0,0) to 2 mM
Ca“, 0 mM Mg“, 100 uM Zn* (hereafter indicated as 2,0,100) and the results for 0,2,0 to
0,2,100 are considered preliminary; in order to balance the images, an unknown nonlinear
conversion (photomultiplier tube voltage change) was applied between the zinc addition
experiment and the pyrithione addition experiment. A different nonlinear PMT voltage change
was used for the induced versus uninduced. This nonlinearity may explain the uncharacteristic
downturn at the ends of the 0,2,0 — 0,2,100 graphs for induced and uninduced (Fig. 5) or the
downturn in the uninduced graph for 2,0,0 - 2,0,100 (Fig. 4). In any case, induced cells
increased in fluorescence more than uninduced cells, which indicates more loading of zinc,
though the nonlinear conversion prevents us from knowing by how much. The nonlinear
conversion also prevents comparison of the 0,2 and 2,0 experiments with each other or any other
experiments, so it is impossible to determine the specific differences in effect between a lack of
Mg“ and a lack of Ca“ on zinc loading.
The 2,2,0 - 2,2,100 (Fig. 6) and 0,0,0 - 0,0,100 (Fig. 7) experimental results are more
useful; because no nonlinear conversion was applied, uninduced data can be compared to
induced data, and the experiments can be compared to each other. Again, induced cells clearly
fluoresced more upon addition of zinc than uninduced cells, and cells in 0,0 fluoresced upon
addition of zinc more than cells in 2,2. Uninduced cells in 0,0 also showed a greater increase in
fluorescence than uninduced cells in 2,2. The average maximum fluorescence value for 2,2 is
1.35 (35% above baseline), in contrast to the max for 0,0, which is 1.53 (53% above baseline).
