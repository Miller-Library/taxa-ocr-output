Tsirka, 2003). Zinc is also implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions like
Alzheimer’s disease (Koh et al., 1996). In the case of the role of zinc in Guamanian amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC), conflicting results exist.
Significantly decreased Zn“ in frontal cortex gray matter of both ALS and PDC cases was found
in one study (Yasui et al., 1993), while significantly increased Zn“ in gray matter of PDC cases
was found in another (Gellein et al., 2003). It has been suggested that some Guamanians express
mutant forms of TRPM7 (Hermosura, unpublished). In any case, zinc imbalance in the brain is
likely a cause of Guamanian ALS and PDC, and since TRPM7 is a mechanism for zinc influx,
we decided to examine Zn“ movement through TRPMT in vivo with a focus on interactions with
the main physiological divalents, Mg? and Ca?t.
Materials & Methods
Cells and cell culture - Experiments were conducted using HEK-293 cells, as designated by the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were transfected with murine
TRPM7 (Monteilh-Zoller et al., 2003). Cells were grown at 37 °C in T,g tissue culture flasks
containing a mixture of DMD-F12, 10% FBS, 0.1% penicillin, and 0.1% streptomycin in an
atmosphere of 5% CO», 95% O, as per the ClonTech (Palo Alto, CA) tetracycline induction
system. Cells were on a 2-day passage/plating schedule, and were plated onto circular
polylycine-coated glass chips (BLAH in diameter) in 35 mm Petri dishes. Cells were induced
with 1.5 mL tetracycline after approximately 24 hours of growth on chips.
Solutions - Four stocks were produced ahead of time in distilled/deionized water, pH balanced to
7.2, and stored at 4 °C (Table 1). In order to make 100 uM Zn“ solutions, 10 mM ZnCl, was
produced the day of experiments, and 500 uL of this solution was added to 49.5 mL of the
