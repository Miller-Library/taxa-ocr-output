Introduction
The TRP - transient receptor potential - family consists of ion channel subunits
comprised of six membrane-spanning domains (Clapham et al., 2001). All eukaryotic cells
express some member(s) of the TRP family. The mammalian TRP channels are classified into
three groups: C - short, V - vanilloid, and M - melastatin. Of the TRPM family of cation
channels, TRPM6 and TRPM7 are unique in that they both contain kinase domains. The
function of the TRPM7 kinase domain is not well understood, and this domain's activity has
been characterized only very recently (Ryazanova et al., 2004), though the kinase is known not
to be required for TRPM7 channel gating (Schmitz et al., 2003). The TRPM7 channel is
inactivated by phospholipase C (PLC) activity and resultant phosphatidylinositol 4,5¬
bisphosphate (PIP») hydrolysis (Runnels et al., 2002) and is activated by low intracellular
magnesium (Nadler et al., 2001). The channel conducts divalent cations inwardly and
monovalent cations outwardly and is outwardly-rectifying (Runnels et al., 2001). TRPM7 is
widely expressed in the human body, and likely has a central role in Mg“ homeostasis (Schmitz
et al., 2003). TRPM7 Ca“ may be essential for cell viability (Nadler et al., 2001). In addition to
normal physiological transport of Ca* and Mg*, TRPM7 acts as a trace and nonphysiological
metal divalent cation influx pathway, exhibiting especially high permeation of Zn“ (Monteilh-
Zoller et al., 2003), albeit at concentrations of zinc 1000x above physiological levels (Perveen et
al., 2002).
Zinc is involved in a number of normal physiological functions, ranging from synaptic
release during brain function (Zatta et al., 2003) to immune response (Shankar and Prasad,
1998). However, excessive levels of zinc in neurons can be toxic via nitric oxide-implicated
neuron cell death (Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2004) and elevated glutamate excitotoxicity (Siddiq and
