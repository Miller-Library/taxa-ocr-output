between transplanted T. brunnea at high and low tides after 3 hours and between
transplanted T. funebralis and T. brunnea at high and low tides after 24 hours. This
adjusted a-value was used because of lack of independence of the individual tests
and was obtained using the Dunn-Sidak equation (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). A
comparison between displacement values of transplanted T. brunnea at high and
low tides after 24 hours was not made because after 24 hours, the snails had already
experienced at least one high tide. A two-factor ANOVA test could not be used in
place of the t-tests because data sets were incomplete; control T. brunnea were not
counted at 1.5 hours and 3 hours.
Reciprocal Transplant Experiment, T. funebralis
T. funebralis were transplanted down to between 3 to 4 feet below MLLW, the
highest point at which T. brunnea could be found in abundance. Two transplants
were done at high tide, two transplants at low tide. Two sets of controls in which T.
funebralis were placed back to their natural habitat at upper-mid intertidal were
performed at high and low tides. Measurements of average displacement were
calculated as for T. brunnea.
A two-factor ANÖVA was performed with transplant-control as one factor
and high tide-low tide as the second factor, in order to determine significance of
differences within each factor and between each factor, and to determine significance
of interactions between the two factors.
Two-sample t-tests assuming unequal variances were also performed between
T. funebralis and T. brunnea at high and low tides to determine significance of
differences between displacements at these two tide heights. An ANÖVA test could
