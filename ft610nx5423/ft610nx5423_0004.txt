Zonation of Tegula

HSD tests were used to analyze differences in microhabitat utilization by T.
funebralis and T. brunnea during high tides and low tides.
Reciprocal Transplant Experiment, T. brunnea
T. brunnea were transferred to the typical shore height of T. funebralis, up to
heights between 2 and 4 feet above MLLW. Each set of high and low tide T. brunnea
transplants were done at two locations, three times at one location and one time at
the other. One of these sets of transplants was done during nighttime high and low
tides. One hundred snails were scrubbed to remove algae from their shells and were
then painted with flourescent enamel paints. During low tide transplants, snails
were placed on air-exposed surfaces about 0.5 m away from the water edge. During
high tide transplants, snails were placed under water at a depth of 0.3m to 0.5m.
Transplants were checked 1.5 hours, 3 hours and approximately 24 hours after
initiation of the experiment. Positions of snails found were recorded to the nearest
meter from the release site; negative values were given to snails moving upshore
and positive values were given to snails moving downshore. The average
displacement of all snails found at each time point was calculated.
Two controls were performed at high tide in which 100 T. brunnea were
painted in a similar fashion to transplanted snails but were placed back to their
typical height on the shore at about 4 feet below Mean Lower Low Water level.
Measurements were taken after 24 hours, and average displacement was calculated
as with transplanted T. brunnea.
Two-tailed t-tests assuming unequal variances, with adjusted a-level 0.013,
were performed between 24-hour displacement values of transplanted and control
T. brunnea, between transplanted T. brunnea at high and low tides after 1.5 hours,
