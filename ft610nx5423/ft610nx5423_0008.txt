(Table 3) did not display any significant differences (ANOVA, p » 0.05) in migration
rate.
Comparison of T. funebralis and T. brunnea movements
T. brunnea and T. funebralis migrated to their typical heights on the shore at
significantly different rates both at high tides (t =-10.78, p ««0.001) and at low tides (t
= -8.76, p «20.001). T. brunnea moved much faster downshore after both high tide
and low tide transplants (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
From this study, it appears that Tegula funebralis tolerate exposure to air
more than Tegula brunnea. T. brunnea generally avoids movement when exposed,
while T. funebralis exhibits a climbing behavior and prefers vertical faces to
horizontal surfaces, even when exposed.
Although differences in displacement of transplanted T. brunnea at high and
low tides were not significant,T. brunnea moved much faster downshore when they
were transplanted under water during high tides than when they were transplanted
at low tides and exposed to air. In three of the low-tide transplants, no snails moved
for the first three hours, and in the fourth and last transplant, only three snails
moved less than 1 meter away from the release site.
Transplanted T. brunnea moved not only further than controls, but also in a
more consistent direction. The majority of transplanted T. brunnea moved
downshore, whereas movement of control animals placed back into their natural
low shore habitat was more scattered in both directions.
