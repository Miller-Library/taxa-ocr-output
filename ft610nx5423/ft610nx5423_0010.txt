Zonation of Tegula

demonstrated that, in comparison with organisms living lower, higher intertidal
animals tend to have higher desiccation tolerances and lower desiccation rates
(Wolcott 1973).
Climbing behavior of T. funebralis could be responsible for the lower limit of
their distributions. Both T. funebralis in the field and in the laboratory exhibited
this behavior. The reason for this is unknown, but it is possible that it was once an
attempt to avoid predators (Paine 1969) that has since evolved into behavior. T.
funebralis may have evolved this behavior while T. brunnea did not because a
major predator of the two species, Cancer antenarius, finds it easier to crack the
shells of T. funebralis than T. brunnea (Abbott and Haderlie 1980). Thus, T.
funebralis have a disadvantage in encounters with the predator Cancer.
While Rocca (1995) showed that physiological tolerance rather than behavior
allows T. funebralis to live in the high intertidal, this study indicates that both
factors play a part in their habitat selection. T. funebralis are better able to tolerate
heat and desiccation stress than T. brunnea and they have also developed a climbing
behavior that may allow them to escape predators which do not feed above the
waterline, such as Cancer antenarius and Pisaster ochraceus. Research has been
done that demonstrates T. funebralis exhibit climbing behavior in the presence of
predators (Fawcett 1984, Markowitz 1980, Paine 1969). In the laboratory component
of this study, T. funebralis climbing behavior is shown to occur even when no
predators are present.
Ã–ther factors may also be responsible for T. funebralis and T. brunnea
zonation, including larval dispersal. Larval recruitment is an important cause of
the spatial segregation of the three subtidal Tegula species (Watanabe 1984) and it is
known that T. funebralis larvae settle high in the intertidal zone (Paine 1969) and T.
