not be used in place of these t-tests because data sets were incomplete; T. brunnea
controls were not performed at low tides.
RESULTS
Vertical Zonation
Abundance of T. funebralis was greatest between 2 and 4 feet above MLLW
and decreased with decreasing height on the shore. No T. brunnea were found at
heights above MLLW (Fig. 1). The zone of maximum T. brunnea abundance was
between 2 and 4 feet below MLLW. Densities of both species in the zones of overlap,
at 0 to 4 feet below MLLW, were low (less than 25 T. funebralis, less than 10 T.
brunnea per 0.25 m2 quadrat) compared to maximum T. funebralis densities (almost
75 T. funebralis per 0.25 m2 quadrat).
Laboratory Experiment
In all three replicates of experiments, T. brunnea tended to stay on the
horizontal bottom of the tank significantly more than did T. funebralis (Tables 1 and
2). No T. brunnea were ever found above the waterline during high tides, while T.
funebralis were regularly found above the waterline.
When low tides were simulated by removal of the standing-pipe, T. brunnea
visibly followed the receding waterline; often, in less than 10 minutes, all T.
brunnea had moved down to the bottom of the tank. During nighttime low tides,
more T. brunnea were found on the walls, with an average of 3% on the walls. For
