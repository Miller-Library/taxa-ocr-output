Zonation of Tegula
Shi Jane Liaw
ABSTRACT
Two intertidal species of Tegula, T. brunnea and T. funebralis, display distinct
vertical zonation. T. brunnea inhabit the lower intertidal to shallow subtidal zone,
while T. funebralis are found in the upper-mid intertidal zone. Reciprocal
transplants of each species to the habitat of the other revealed that T. brunnea
returns to its typical height on the shore significantly more quickly than does T.
funebralis. Transplanted T. brunnea and transplanted T. funebralis move
significantly further and in a more consistent direction than do control animals
placed back in their respective natural habitats. Although no statistical differences
were observed between transplants done in high and low tides, a consistent trend of
less movement by T. brunnea during low tides was observed. Microhabitat
utilization during simulated low and high tides in the laboratory showed that T.
brunnea remains submerged and on horizontal surfaces significantly more than T.
funebralis, which tend to occupy vertical surfaces both above and below the
waterline. Night and daytime behavior are similar for T. funebralis and differ for T.
brunnea in the laboratory.
