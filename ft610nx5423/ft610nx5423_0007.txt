daytime low tides, the average percentage of T. brunnea on the walls was less than
1%.
T.brunnea were much more likely to climb and stay on the walls during high
tides than during low tides. Twenty percent of T. brunnea were found on the walls
during daytime high tides, below the waterline, while less than 1% were found on
the walls during daytime low tides.
T. funebralis did not avoid air exposure as much as T. brunnea, and did not
follow the waterline as it receded during low tides. Numbers of T. funebralis on the
wall were fairly consistent throughout day and nighttime, high- and low-tide
transplants. T. funebralis on walls and on the bottom surface did not exhibit any
movement when water was drained for low tides.
Reciprocal Transplant Experiment, T. brunnea
T. brunnea transplanted to heights between 2 and 4 feet above MLLW
migrated significantly (t = 9.55, p««0.01) more after 24 hours than control T. brunnea
placed at their typical shore height (Fig. 2). Transplants done during high and low
tides (Fig. 3) did not display significant differences (t = 3.15, p » 0.05) in migration
rate after 3 hours. Transplants done during high and low tides after 1.5 hours also
did not display significant differences and trends were similar to that of transplants
after 3 hours and thus, results were not graphed.
Reciprocal Transplant Experiment, T. funebralis
T. funebralis transplanted to heights between 3 and 4 feet below MLLW
migrated significantly more (ANOVA, p « 0.05) than control T. funebralis placed at
their typical shore height (Fig. 4). Transplants done during high and low tides
