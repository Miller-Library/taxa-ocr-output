Zonation of Tegula

brunnea larvae settle in the low intertidal to shallow subtidal zone (Watanabe 1984).
Larval recruitment may therefore play a part in the segregation of these two species
as well. However, this theory cannot fully explain why the snails would migrate
towards their typical shore habitat after being transplanted.
Microhabitat preferences may also be partially responsible for the zonation of
T. funebralis and T. brunnea. Byers and Mitton (1981) found that after translocation
T. funebralis return to their natural habitats through a recognition of ecological
characteristics of the habitats. T. brunnea are found most often in areas of dense
algal cover (Watanabe 1984) while T. funebralis avoids dense algal cover (Wara and
Wright 1963). It is thus possible that in the reciprocal transplants of this study, T.
funebralis and T. brunnea were migrating to areas of preferred microhabitat. Even
so, other factors must be considered in combination, for microhabitat preference
alone cannot explain how snails are able to discern their location when
transplanted, and move in the correct direction towards their natural habitats.
Interspecific competition does not appear to influence zonation patterns
between T. funebralis and T. brunnea, since intraspecific densities of T. funebralis
are much greater (about 75 T. funebralis per 0.25m2 quadrat) than interspecific
densities where the two species overlap (less than 25 snails per 0.25m2 quadrat).
Furthermore, Watanabe (1984) has shown that interspecific competition is not
higher than intraspecific competition between T. brunnea and the two other
subtidal Tegula species, T. montereyi and T. pulligo. This may also the case between
T. brunnea and T. funebralis.
While Wara and Wright (1963) demonstrated that T. funebralis movement
was light-dependent, with snails moving up to rock tops during night high tides
and not day high tides, this study found no significant differences between the
