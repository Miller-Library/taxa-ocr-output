Zonation of Tegula

INTRODUCTION
In order to understand the dynamics of a biological community, one must
first understand the behaviors of its component organisms, including the reasons
for their habitat choices. The rocky intertidal is an ideal community to study
because of the ease of access to intertidal areas, the gradient of abiotic stresses to
organisms caused by fluctuations in tidal height, and the abundance of many species
(Connell, 1974). Two such species are Tegula funebralis and Tegula brunnea.
Tegula funebralis is a gastropod abundant in the upper- to mid-intertidal
zone between one and five feet above Mean Lower Low Water
(Wara and Wright 1963, Abbott and Haderlie 1980) with a population center at about
+3 feet. Tegula brunnea is found in the low intertidal to shallow subtidal zone,
between 0 and 18 feet below MLLW (Abbott and Haderlie 1980, Watanabe 1984).
These two common turban snails share many characteristics, including shell shape,
size, diet and behavior. However, despite similar physiological characteristics, they
are clearly vertically zoned.
Because they are vertically zoned, abundant and move at a rate that is
relatively easy to track, T. funebralis and T. brunnea are useful organisms in which
to study habitat selection. While there has been substantial research on the
zonation and migration behavior of T. funebralis (Wara and Wright 1963, Frank
1975, Markowitz 1980, Byers and Mitton 1981, Byers 1983, Fawcett 1984), little
research has been done on T. brunnea zonation and migration. Thus, special
interest in T. brunnea behavior motivated this study. In this study, a reciprocal
transplant experiment and a laboratory experiment were conducted to examine the
reasons for the ecological separation of the two species.
