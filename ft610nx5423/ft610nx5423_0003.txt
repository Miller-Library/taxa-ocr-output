Zonation of Tegula
Shi Jane Liaw
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vertical Zonation
Two transects were sampled perpendicular to the shoreline at Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA, and one transect was sampled at Point Pinos,
Pacific Grove, CA. Each transect was divided into four zones and all Tegula species
in five 0.25m2 quadrats were counted within each zone. The positions of the
quadrats along each transect were located using a list of random numbers. Heights
at Point Pinos were measured relative to water level at the predicted time of low
tide using a surveyorâ€™s transit and stadia rod. Heights at Hopkins Marine Station
were determined from a detailed topographic map of the intertidal zone.
Laboratory Experiment
Fifty snails of each species were placed in a 3 x 3m outdoor tank with running
seawater. High and low tides were simulated during both day and night. To
simulate high tides, a stand-pipe was placed in the drain which maintained a water
depth of 10.1 inches in the tank. Observations were made every half-hour for at
least an hour; during high tides the number of each species above the waterline,
below the waterline and on the bottom of the tank were recorded. During low tides,
the stand-pipe was removed and the water allowed to drain out of the tank. Counts
were taken of snails on the walls and on the bottom surface of the tank every half-
hour for at least an hour.
Both day and nighttime sets of high and low tide experiments were replicated
three times, with three different groups of snails. Analysis of Variance and Tukey
