Zonation of Tegula

number of snails at higher latitude in the tank during day and night. However,
further investigation would be of value.
The differences in displacements of transplanted T. funebralis and T.
brunnea, with T. brunnea moving significantly longer distances than T. funebralis,
show that the factors limiting T. brunnea are probably more direct than those
limiting T. funebralis. This is in keeping with previous studies (Dayton 1971, Paine
1974) that show that upper limits of intertidal organism range tend to be caused by
abiotic factors, while lower limits tend to be caused by biotic interactions. It is also in
keeping with the theory that heat and desiccation may be the cause of T. brunnea
zonation and an evolved climbing behavior may be the cause of T. funebralis
zonation.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank my advisor, Jim Watanabe, for his guidance, dedication
and boundless knowledge of snails and other intertidal creatures. I would also like
to thank my "snorkel buddies", especially Josh Rapport, without whom I could
never have found and counted that many tiny fluorescent snails.
