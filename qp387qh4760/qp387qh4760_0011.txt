grippable. Even though there was a significant amount of lip damage found on
the shells of ovigerous females, none of it seemed so severe as to hamper the
efforts for courtship.
Whorl and apex demage, however, can lead to unsuccessul reproduction.
Since female hermit crabs must hold their eggs in their shell until they become
attached to their pleopods (Coffin 1960), any holes in the shell are possible areas
for eggs to be lost. In terms of shell use, this may imply that females, once
ovigerous, must be in an intact shell to ensure attachment of the eggs to her
pleopods. For these reasons, it appears unlikely that ovigerous females would
ever want to change shells. Furthermore, observations in the lab made it clear
that ovigerous females would have a harder time entering a shell with a clutch
attached.
The fouling data suggests that the fouling of shells does not appear to
influence the choices of shells for non-ovigerous, ovigerous, and male hermit
crabs. Therefore, the visual examination of shells as potential homes may be the
same for ovigerous, non-ovigerous and male hermit crabs.
Although not statiscally significant, shell adequacy appeared to affect the
clutch sizes of P. granosimanus hermit crabs. These results agree with the
findings of Bertness, in which he found that as the shell size adequacy
decreased, the number of eggs increased. As shown by the shell adequacy index
for the three crabs, the ovigerous females are living in shells that are at least
15% smaller than their preferred size. So it is possible that the Pagurus
granosimanus is doing what Bertness described for another species: ovigerous
females change the aim of their energy expenditure from finding a larger
shell, to just producing a larger number of eggs.
This trend was not true for the P. samuelis crabs. Since most of the shells
were slightly larger than predicted, it is difficult to determine how ovigerous
