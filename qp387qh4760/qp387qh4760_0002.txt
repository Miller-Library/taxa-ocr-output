Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
Introduction
Ovigerous female hermit crabs must rely on their shell for survival and
for the survival of their egg clutch. Factors such as shell availability and the
habitat in which a female hermit crab lives may affect the success of
reproduction and egg maintenance. Furthermore, reproduction and energy
expenditure may influence the proportions of ovigerous females, non-ovigerous
females, and males located at different lcoations and at different heights along
the intertidal zone.
Shell size affects a hermit crabâ€™s reproductive effort, i.e., how many eggs
are brooded, but the effect varies from species to species. For one species, C.
vittatus, a large shell provides more room for brooding eggs (Fotheringham
1976), but for others, such as the Calcinus obscurus, increased shell size results
in greater energy expenditure in growth rather than reproductive effort,
resulting in fewer eggs (Bertness 1980).
Shell damage can be a variable in the susceptibility to predation for
hermit crabs. One of the local predators, Cancer antennarius, can more easily
eat hermit crabs occupying a damage shell than an intact shell (personal
observation). However it is unclear whether shell damage influences how
shells are distributed among the non-ovigerous, ovigerous and males.
A study of Pagurus longicarpus indicated that shell fouling and shell
damage may have an affect on the clutch size depending on the habitat and the
size of the hermit crab(Wilber 1989).
The distributions of Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis have
been identified for the Hopkins Marine Station (Belknap, Robert and John
Markham 1965). P. samuelis occupy the higher portions of the intertidal, and P.
granosimanus occupy the intertidal zone below, with some overlap. However,
