Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
observed shield length of an ovigerous female were omitted. The remaining
non-ovigerous and ovigerous females were separated into adequacy bins, and
the percentage of ovigerous females of the total females for each bin was
calculated. For both Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis, as shell size
increased from a small fit to a larger fit, the percentage of ovigerous females out
of the total number of females decreased.
Clutch Size
The number of eggs to egg weight ratio was calculated from 7 clutches of
hermit crabs (p = .947) (Fig 15). Note that these weights intermixed the eggs
from both species, and did not take into account any variability in eggs between
the species.
For each species, clutch size was compared to crab wet weight, size, shell
fouling, shell damage, and distribution at each three transects. None of these
variables were correlated to the number of eggs that an ovigerous female
carried. One possible correlation found was with the shell adequacy index for P.
gransimanus. As the shell adequacy index decreased for the ovigerous P
granosimanus, i.e., the hermit crab inhabited a shell smaller than the calculated
preferred shell size, the egg number increased (Fig 16). Although the p-value is
not considered significant (p Â« .07), more collection of ovigerous females may be
able to reveal a significant trend.
