and ovigerous’ shell damage was significant (p = 0.01). The difference between
the ovigerous’ and males’ shell damage was significant too (p = 0.04)
Fouling
The predominant fouling organisms were Spirobis spp. and Crepidula
planca , which were commonly found together.
There was no significant difference in the proportion of fouling for
shells occupied by P. granosimanus non-ovigerous, ovigerous, and males (p =
0.93) (Fig 8). The same was true for shells inhabited by P. samuelis (p = 0.60) (Fig
There was a difference in fouling of shells (p = 0.04) between the two
species of hermit crabs (Fig 10), which may be related to the difference in
intertidal heights in which the crabs live and where fouling organisms live
along the intertidal.
Adequacy
Non-ovigerous P. granosimanus were in shells larger than their
preferred size at all three sites (Fig 11). The ovigerous were in shells smaller
than the preferred size. At West Beach, ovigerous females were in shells 25%
smaller than preferred.
For P. samuelis, all were in shells larger than they preferred, except for
males at West Beach (Fig 12). At Agassiz Beach and West Beach, ovigerous
females were in shells smaller than the shells inhabited by the non-ovigerous.
At the Hewett Transect, the situation reversed, and the ovigerous female had a
larger shell than the preferred size shell of the non-ovigerous.
Shell adequacy did have an effect on the reproductive potential of a
female (Fig 13 & 14). To examine this relationship, females below the first
