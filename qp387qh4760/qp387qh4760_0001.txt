Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
Abstract
Two intertidal hermit crabs, Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus
samuelis, were studied at the Hopkins Marine Station. The two species
demonstrate definite zonation along the intertidal, but intraspecies differences
are not known. Past studies have shown that shell characteristics, such as
damage, fouling, and adequacy have varying influences on the reproductive
success of female.
Ovigerous females, non-ovigerous females, and males were examined at
three different locations.
The study of the distribution and the shell utilization
of each of the hermit crabs revealed that males were more predominant than
females. Non-ovigerous females were more common than males. Shell fouling
had no effect on the shell utilization by ovigerous, non-ovigerous and male
hermit crabs. Ovigerous females were in shells with less damage. Shell
adequacy assignments showed that females were more likely to be ovigerous if
they occupied smaller shells than the preferred size calculated from a shell
adequacy index. Clutch size was minimally correlated to other measurements.
