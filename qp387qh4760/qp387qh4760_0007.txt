Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
were more abundant than ovigerous and non-ovigerous crabs (Fig 4). At West
Beach and the Hewett Area, there were more non-ovigerous females than
ovigerous females. But at Agassiz Beach, there was a lower percentage of males
and a higher percentage of ovigerous females than non-ovigerous females.
There was no statistical difference among the proportion of non-ovigerous,
ovigerous and males at the three transects however (p = 0.16).
Trends across the sites (up/down along the intertidal) in a transect were
inconclusive due to some sites having a sparse population of hermit crabs.
Therefore, population distribution analysis focused on trends between the
transects and not the sites within the transects.
Shell Damage
Overall shell damage observations showed that ovigerous P. granosimanus
had shells that were more intact than the shells occupied by the non-ovigerous
and males (Fig 5). At the three transects, ovigerous P. granosimanus were in
shells that had no whorl or apex damage (Fig 6). Among the non-ovigerous,
ovigerous and males, the shells in the Hewett Area had the most damage,
whereas Agassiz Beach had least shell damage. Despite this, damage differences
among the non-ovigerous females, ovigerous females and males were not found
to be significant(p = 0.33).
Shells occupied by P. samuelis in the Hewett Transect were more damaged
than the shells found in the other two transects. The transect with the lowest
amount of shell damage was West Beach. Overall, 86% of ovigerous P. samuelis
were in shells that were intact (Fig 7). Non-ovigerous females were present in
shells that were more damaged than the ovigerous. Males had most of the shells
with lip, whorl and apex damage. The difference between the non-ovigerous
