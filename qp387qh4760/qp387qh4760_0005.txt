Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
and egg weight was measureed. A linear regression determined an egg
number:weight ratio that was later used to determine the number of eggs for
some clutches for which the eggs were not counted.
The following data were recorded for the shells occupied by the hermit
crabs: species, diameter, weight, fouling, and degree of damage. Shell diameter
was measured with Vernier calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. Shells were dried
before weighing in a microwave for two minutes on the high setting. Shell
weight included weight of any fouling organisms. The gastropods Spirorbis
spp., the polychaetes Cripidula adunca and Cripidula planca, and the non-
geniculate coralline alga Lithothamnion spp. on the underside of the shell and
on the whorl were noted. Damage of the lip, body, and apex was also noted.
A shell adequacy index (SAI) which measures deviation from a calculated
preferred shell size, (Kim 1994) was assigned to each hermit crab and its shell.
The SAI was derived by placing 50 P. samuelis and 57 P. granosimanus
individuals into tanks with an overabundance of shells (1:8 crab to shell ratio).
The crabs were given 5 days to acclimate to their new environment and select
shells. At the end of the five days, it was assumed that the crab was in the shell
size it preferred, and the crab’s wet-weight and the diameter of its shell were
measured. A linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between
crab weight and shell diameter to derive the SAI.
Wet weight of the crab was compared to its shield length and a linear
regression between the two measurements was determined. This regression was
used to determine either the wet-weight or shield length for a few individuals
(«10) whose wet-weight or shield length measurement was not recorded.
