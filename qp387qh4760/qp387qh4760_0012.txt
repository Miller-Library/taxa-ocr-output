Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
females may decide to expend their energy in growth effort or reproductive
effort. However, since the adequacy data suggests that P. samuelis is not shell
stressed, this trend may be irrelevant.
Summary
Examination of the different areas along the intertidal at the Hopkins
Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA, has shown that the difference in habitats,
from an exposed area to a protected area did not have a strong correlation with
the makeup of non-ovigerous, ovigerous and male hermit crabs of either
species. Differences were noted along each of the sites of the transects but no
definite trend was found to describe the distribution of female hermit crabs.
Damage of shell measurements reflected that ovigerous females were in
shells that were more intact than shells occupied by non-ovigerous females.
This was true for both species. This finding may be of a preference of ovigerous
females or a sign that reproduction may be facilitated when a shell is intact.
The latter seems more probable but additional studies need to be conducted.
Females were more likely to be ovigerous if the shell size was smaller
than the preferred size suggested from a shell adequacy index.
Reproductive effort was only affected by the adequacy of the shell, as no
variables regarding habitat, shell fouling, or tidal height had any correlation.
My findings agree with some other species of hermit crab, i.e., as shell size
becomes smaller than the preferred size, ovigerous females put more effort into
reproduction than growth, rather than expend energy on pursuing a shell that
may be only minimally larger.
