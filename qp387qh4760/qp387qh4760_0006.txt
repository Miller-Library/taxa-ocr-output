Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
A total of 136 Pagurus granosimanus and 180 Pagurus samuelis were
collected. Pagurus hirsuiticulus were collected as well but a limited sample size
(n = 36) was not sufficient for a similar study of this species.
The smallest ovigerous P. granosimanus was 4.3 mm in shield length, and
the largest had a shield length of 6.8 mm. The females ranged from 2.3 mm to 5.9
mm, while the males were 1.8 mm to 7.2 mm in shield length.
The smallest ovigerous P. samuelis was 4.0 mm in shield length and the
largest was 5.8 mm. Females ranged from 2.5 mm to 5.6 mm and the males ranged
from 2.2 mm to 6.5 mm.
The different ranges and overlapping of sizes for non-ovigerous,
ovigerous and males indicates that the ovigerous females, non-ovigerous
females and males are not necesssarily competing for the same shells (Fig 2).
Distribution
At West Beach, the Hewett Transect, and Agassiz Beach, 50, 31, and 55 P.
granosimanus were collected, respectively. Of the Pagarus granosimanus
collected, males (avg 64%) were more abundant than the ovigerous and non-
ovigerous. Non-ovigerous females were more common than ovigerous females.
There was a slight increase in males and a decrease in ovigerous females as the
studied area shifted from the exposed area, West Beach, to the protected area,
Agassiz beach (Fig 3). However, there was no statistical difference among the
proportions of non-ovigerous, ovigerous, and male Pagurus granosimanus at the
three transects (p = 0.82). A larger sample size may be needed to accurately
describe a possible trend between the habitats.
At West Beach, the Hewett Transect, and Agassiz Beach, 22, 56, and 102
Pagurus samuelis were collected, respectively. At the three transects, males
