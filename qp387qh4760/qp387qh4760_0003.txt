Martinez, E. The Distribution and Shell Utilization of the Female Hermit Crab
distribution studies have not reviewed the breakdown of non-ovigerous,
ovigerous, and male hermit crabs. P. granosimanus and P. samuelis are
susceptible to dessication and thermal stress (Taylor 1981), but how those
stresses affect the proportion of non-ovigerous, ovigerous, and males along the
intertidal is uncertain.
The purpose of this study was to determine how a habitat affects the
proportions of females, ovigerous females, and males. Ã–ther elements such as
relative tidal height were examined to indicate if the females, ovigerous females,
and males were more likely to remain in particular parts of the intertidal to
alleviate thermal and dessication stress. Also the type of damage on a shell was
examined for differences between the shell utilization of the non-ovigerous,
ovigerous, and males.
Methods and Materials
Two species of hermit crabs, Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis
were collected from the intertidal zone of the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific
Grove, California. Collection took place during May 11-13, 1994, during low tide.
Three locations were chosen for study: West Beach, an exposed area that
receives direct wave action; Hewett Transect, a semi-protected area; and Agassiz
Beach, a protected area which receives less wave action of the three (Fig 1). At
each location a transect running perpendicular to the shore from the high
intertidal to the lowest exposed position (approximately -0.5 m MLLW) was
sampled. Each transect was divided into five collection sites 2 meters apart
horizontally.
For each site, approximately 0.25 m2, the first fifty (50) hermit crabs were
collected or until thirty (30) minutes had elapsed. If fifty crabs were not
