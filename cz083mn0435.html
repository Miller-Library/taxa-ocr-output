INTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dorvillea moniloceras : Exact'>Dorvillea moniloceras</span> (Moore, 1909) is a common represen¬
tative of the polychaete family <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dorvilleidae : Exact'>Dorvilleidae</span> in the Monterey
Bay area. Originally known as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Stauronereis moniloceras : Exact'>Stauronereis moniloceras,</span> its
external morphology was first described by Moore (1909). Cham¬
berlin (1919) noted that gut analyses of another species of
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Dorvillea : Exact'>Dorvillea,</span> D. cr
ssa, yielded sand, diatoms, sponge spicules.
and crustacean fragments. According to Hartman (1945) speci-
mens can be collected intertidally among coralline algae in
Pacific Grove. Two other populations have been found in the
area, (1) subtidally in <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis pyrifera : Exact'>Macrocystis pyrifera</span> holdfasts and
(2) on the underside of the boat floats at the Monterey Mar-
ina. To expand on gut analysis studies by Chamberlin (1919)
and in an attempt to elucidate the diet of D. moniloceras,
fecal pellet analyses were performed on specimens from the
latter habitat. Also laboratory feeding experiments were
conducted on specimens from the same habitat to support fecal
pellet data.

FECAL PELLET ANALYSIS
Specimens of D. moniloceras were collected by hand from
among the clusters of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Phyllochaetopterus prolifica : Exact'>Phyllochaetopterus prolifica</span> (abbreviated
as PCT), a polychaete, and colonies of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ascidia ceratodes : Exact'>Ascidia ceratodes,</span> a
tunicate, on the underside of the boat floats at the Monterey
Marina. Two containers were used to transport each group of

worms from the marina to the laboratory where individuals were
immediately isolated into numbered Petri dishes. Specimens
were maintained in standing sea water at 12°0 for 1.5-2.0 days,
after which time the majority had defecated. Fecal pellets
were extracted from individual dishes with a Pasteur pipette,
isolated in separate compartments in sea water, and reserved
for analysis.
Size data of specimens consisted of width, length, and
number of segments. Data were obtained by anesthetizing each
worm separately in isotonic Mgcl, to impose a uniform body cond¬
ments were taken using a dissecting microscope,
ition. Measur
Worm width was measured from parapodia tip to parapodia tip in
the approximate middle section of the worm. Length was measured
from tip of prostomium to tip of pygidium. The prostomium,
peristomium, and pygidium were included in the number of seg¬
ments of each worm.
Analyses of pellets proceeded as follows. Relative amount
of feces was first estimated for each specimen on an arbitrary
scale of 0-5. Then individual pellets were placed on glass
slides and gently teased apart with needle probes. Finally, a
compound microscope (100x) was used in estimating relative
percentages in terms of volume of fecal pellet constituents.

FEEDING EXPERIMENTS
1). To determine whether or not D. moniloceras would eat det-
ritus present in laboratory sea water, the following steps
were taken. Six small fingerbowls were submerged in a plastic
tub, 50x30x20 cm, with fresh running sea water. One starved
Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 3
worm with an empty gut was placed in each bowl with approx-
imately 4 mm2 of detritus previously collected from running
sea water in the laboratory. Observations of gut appearances
were taken approximately every 6 hours.
2). A variety of organic materials was chosen as food: a
tunicate, a brown alga <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Macrocystis : Exact'>(Macrocystis),</span> a sea anemone <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Corynactis : Exact'>(Corynactis),</span>
tunicate matrix (of <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. ceratodes),</span> and phytoplankton. The
first four were sliced into small pieces within the range
0.5-1.5 mm2. Approximately 12 particles of each food and 5
drops of phytoplankton were introduced to separate small fin-
gerbowls with standing sea water. Nothing was added to the
control bowl. Two worms were added to each bowl and observed
for 6 hours.
3). To determine whether or not the worm would eat certain
organisms under simulated semi-natural conditions, scrubbed
Por tubes were added to two large fingerbowls until the bowls
were moderately full and the material dense. Then 6-7 spec-
imens, enough fresh sea water to cover the tubes, and 8 pieces
of food were introduced to each bowl. Bowl 1 contained <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Bugula : Exact'>Bugula,</span>
a Bryozoan, with associated hydroids as food, and Bowl 2 con-
tained <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Obelia : Exact'>Obelia,</span> a hydroid, as food. The bowls were maintained
at 12°0, and the water was replaced once a day.
SULTS and DISCUSSION
FECAL PELLET ANALYSIS
Data on worm size obtained from measuring specimens from
the field was used to generate Figures la,b,c. Figure la plots
Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 4
the number of worms against width range for a sample size of
101. The resulting histogram implies by its symmetry a normal
frequency distribution of widths about a mean value of 3.3 mm.
Figure ib plots the number of worms as a function of length.
The histogram generated suggests the existence of a bimodal
distrubution with the depression occurring in the 30-40 mm
range. A skewed distribution is depicted in Fig. 1c which
plots number of worms against number of segments. The occur-
rence of more worms with more segments connotes the possibil-
ity that worms add segments until a maximum determinate number
is reached. The i
ntuitive notion that worm length increases
with worm width is borne out by Fig. 2. Figures la,b.c show
that worm width serves as the best index of worm size.
Figure 3 cor
jains information from direct fecal pellet
analysis. Percent occurrences of the most common diet constit-
uents are illustrated for both the PCT and the tunicate popula-
tions in a decreasing order and an increasing order, respect-
ively. Although setae are shown to occur 46% of the time in
the POT population fecal pellets, an inadvertant sampling error
caused this value to be high. Figure 4 compares the average
percent composition by volume of 103 pellet samples obtained
from PoT and tunicate populations in terms of the most common
identifiable constituents. The arrangement of Fig. 4 is the
same as that of Fig. 3.
In all pellets examined, detritus was present, comprising
most of the average pellet in all worm size groups. Rasping
surfaces to free detritus appears to be one of the two actions
Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 5
of the jaw apparatus of D. moniloceras. The second action is
that of grasping larger objects and passing them to the esoph-
ogeal opening. The laboratory feeding experiment using detri-
tus as the food showed that captive D. moniloceras will eat
detritus. After 30.5 hrs., four of the six experimental worms
had darkened guts, indicating presence of food material.
Detrital material is ubiquitous among Por tubes and tunicate
clusters, the habitat of the experimental animals.
Accompanying detritus in pellets are naviculoid diatoms.
Approximately half of the frustules appear devoid of the org
anism which susgests that they are being digested by the worm.
Diatoms are a rich source of lipid which could supply the worm
with high energy fuel. The small volume of diatoms accounts
for their small value in average percent composition (see
Figs. 5a,b).
The high incidence of crustaceans in feces can be accounted
for by the following. The identifiable crustaceans are benthic
copepods and ostracods, normally found in habitats similar to
Por and tunicate clusters. Detritus grazing by the worms could
include the consumption of these crustaceans.
The fourth most common constituents and third highest in
relative % composition are hydroids of several genera including

since larger worms have the appropriate mouth apparatus size

to consume the hydroid (see Fig. 7). The majority of the
hydroid exoskeletons were empty, suggesting either that the worms
are consuming empty tubes or that they are taking in living
hydroid colonies and digesting the animal matter. In the lat-
ter case, D. moniloceras must have a high tolerance for nemat-
ocysts.
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Bowerbankia gracilis : Exact'>Bowerbankia gracilis</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Bryozoa : Exact'>(Bryozoa)</span> occurs in the fecal pel-
lets analyzed (see Fig.8). Because of its large size relative
to setae and sponge spicules, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Bowerbankia : Exact'>Bowerbankia</span> possesses a high
value for percent composition of fecal pellet despite pos-
sessing the lowest value for percent occurrence.
Statistically, the only significant variation in per-
cent occurrence between size classes occurs with sponge spic-
ules from worms found in POT clusters (p«.005). Other fecal
constituents show increasing or decreasing tendencies as a
function of size class. For example, both hydroids and
Bowerbankia decrease in percent occurrence as width decreases
while Por crustaceans and diatoms increase as width decreases.
Conceivably, smaller worms may be forced to feed on smaller
food choices due to the limited size of their mouths.
Two species of a filamentous red alga, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Polysiphonia : Exact'>Polysiphonia,</span> were
found in pellets of 5 worms taken at the same time from tunicate
clusters. These worms ingesting algae were larger than 3.0 mm:
smaller worms did not have any algae in their pellets.
Dietary constituents of worms from both habitats, PGT
and tunicates, closely resemble each other in occurrence and
percent composition of fecal pellets. Since PoT and A. ceratodes
Feeding Habits of D. moniloceras
W. F. Marshall, Jr. 7
grow near each other on the floats, the two microhabitats are
very similar. Also, it is possible for worms to migrate freely
from one habitat to the other.
Standard deviations of average percent compositions were
large in all cases where the percent composition was substan-
tial. This suggests a large variability in diet in a sample
of worms. However, as a group, they could be selecting prim¬
arily for the food sources shown in Fig. 4.

LABORATORY FEEDING EXPERIMENTS
1). The first laboratory feeding experiments used detritus
(above).
2). No specimens performed feeding motions during the first
1.25 hrs. of observation. Then both worms in the bowl with
chopped Co
ictis began feeding on the anemone surrounded by
mucous. Feeding lasted approximately 5 minutes with the worms
moving their mouth apparati extensively. Within 5 hrs., one
worm developed an open sore on its dorsal anterior. Within
24 hrs., both worms were dead. No other worms were observed
performing the feeding behavior during 2 hrs. of observation.
Like hydroids, anemones are coelenterates and possess nemato-
cysts. However, D. moniloceras can apparently withstand only
the nematocysts of hydroids but perhaps not of anemones.
3). Gut analysis of one worm from each bowl after 3.8 days
yielded the following. Bugula appeared in the gut of the worm
from the bowl where Bugula was introduced as food. Sertularella
was present in the intestine of the specimen that was given
this genus and other hydroid genera as food. Thus, by placing

D. moniloceras in an environment resembling its natural one.
the worm ate food that it normally eats, Sertularella, and
also ate food that it apparently does not normally eat, Bugula.
SUMMARY
The following conclusions can be made concerning the
feeding habits of D. moniloceras:
1. A wide variety of food material is ingested including
hydroids, Bowerbankia (a Bryozoan), sponge spicules, diatoms.
and crustaceans. Detrital material is the most commonly found
substance.
2. There is a tendency for larger worms to eat larger
pieces of food and smaller worms to eat smaller pieces.
3. D. mor
loceras was induced to eat some organisms
under laboratory conditions that it apparently does not nor-
mally eat in nature, although available to them there.

ACKNOULEDGEMENTS
Not to mention the help I received during the course of
this investigation would be terribly unappreciative if not
blatantly rude. Thus, I hereby express my thanks to Isabella
