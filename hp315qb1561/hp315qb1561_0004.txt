funebralis, Ocenebra circumtexta, Acanthina punctulata, and Acanthina spirata; the
chiton Mopalia mucosa; the polychaetes Dodecaceria fewkesi and Phragmatopoma
californica; and the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. The dominant alga at each
site is Endocladia muricata.
Daily Feeding and Temperature Observations
1 marked 35 Nucella emarginata at each site (70 total) with different colors and
numbers in order to differentiate between individuals. Marking was done with ordinary
nail polish and remained intact during the course of the study. I observed the daily
feeding behavior of individuals in the field during periods of lowest day time low water,
missing three periods of lowest low water (n = 3 out of 18 observation periods). Nucella
typically mount their prey and drill through the shell with their radula. They do this until
they are able to scrape out the soft parts with their proboscis. This process may last only
a few hours on small prey while larger mussels can take up to 8 days. When a snail is
feeding during a receding tide, it continues to grip its prey but does not extend its
proboscis when exposed to air. Thus the feeding process is prolonged further. I followed
the techniques of West (1986) in observing N. emarginataâ€™s feeding. To summarize the
technique, determination of snail feeding was always made with minimal disturbance.
Only with the smallest prey species was it sometimes necessary to gently tilt the shell to
determine prey identity. A small mirror also proved to be useful when a snail was hidden
in a crack or crevice. In all cases, active predation was indicated when the snail encircled
the prey with the anterior of the foot and located its buccal mass atop the opercular plates
of barnacles or between the valves a mussel.
