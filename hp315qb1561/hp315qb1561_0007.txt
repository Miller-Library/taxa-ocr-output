for 33% of the total plot area while protected prey accounted for 18%. Prey abundance
and exposure differed between prey species as well. Balanus and Mytilus accounted for
17% and 8% of the total area in sun-exposed areas, while only 3% each in sun-protected
areas. In contrast, Chthamalus spp. was slightly less abundant is sun-exposed areas.
where coverage was 8% compared to sun-protected areas with 12%. These results are
consistent with the behavioral studies on prey identity and exposure levels (Fig. 3). In
sun-exposed areas, there were 92 feeding events upon Balanus and 41 feeding events
upon Mytilus, while there were only 14 and 7, respectively, in sun-protected regions.
This is a decrease of about 85% for each prey species. In contrast, the number of feeding
events upon Chthamalus dropped only 19% from 32 in sun-exposed areas to 26 in sun-
protected areas.
Behavioral Patterns
Habitat use of N. emarginata varied from day to day. Percentages of observed
populations (usually 50-60 of 70 total) at each exposure level and the percent feeding
fluctuated between low tides (Tables 2 and 3). On some days none of the population was
exposed or feeding (22-May at Site 2) while others had well over half both sun-exposed
and feeding (17 and 18-May at Site 2). This was consistent between sites as there were
no significant differences in exposure levels or feeding rates between the two sites
(P=.35, t-test). In addition, feeding and sun exposure were tightly correlated on a day to
day basis at each site (Fig. 4, r2=.78, PS.01). There is also a relationship between feeding
rates and the timing of spring tides (Fig. 5). Average feeding rate for the entire
population (Sites 1 and 2 are lumped) between spring tides is significantly higher (PS.01,
t-test) during early-morning/late-afternoon low tides than mid-day low tides. Differences
