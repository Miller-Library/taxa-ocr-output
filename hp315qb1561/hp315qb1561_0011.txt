when the control group was exposed and feeding. Äfter one week, however, the
transplanted snails left their protected locations and exhibited behavior similar to that of
the control snails. Thus there is an initial shock with transplant, but overall feeding
behavior is still flexible. Since observations were not possible during high tide, it is
possible that the snails did indeed leave their protected areas. They could have fed on
small prey and/or became familiar with their new surroundings until able to leave their
shelter over the course of a low tide.
As the prospects of global climate change become more of a reality, questions
concerning how biological systems will respond to temperature increases become
increasingly pertinent. Peterson et al (1993) and Bhaud et al (1995) examined the
implications of climate change on marine ecosystems and interactions. My study focuses
on one such interaction and suggests a specific and direct thermal risk associated with
predation. While Sanford (2002) showed that increased water temperatures in submerged
Nucella caused' increased feeding rates on mussels, this study shows decreased feeding
rates at high temperatures during aerial exposure. In this way, warmer temperatures can
have multiple, seemingly contrasting effects. The predominate effect depends on both
the magnitude of warming and the media surrounding the animal. Given an air
temperature increase of a 1-2° C, how would N. emarginata respond? How close is this
species to its thermal limits? Sorte (personal communication) has found that N.
emarginata experiences heat coma at 35° C. The heat coma occurs when a snail is no
longer able to remain attached to the substrate. Maximum temperatures for individual
snails during the course of this study exceeded 35° C on 4 different days. Relative to
this, the sheltering response at 28° C then seems fairly conservative. Physiological
