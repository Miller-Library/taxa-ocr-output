responses at these lower temperatures may indeed indicate other forms of sub-lethal
stress. This response does, however, directly impact their feeding behavior and limit
available feeding time.
West (1986) showed that individual N. emarginata vary markedly in diet. How
flexible is their diet? Heinrich (1976) and Werner et al (1981) document instances where
individuals are able to change their preferred diet when necessary. Thus there is the
possibility of smaller and more protected prey species becoming more preferred as low
tide temperatures increase. This can have impacts on succession as mussel beds expand
in response to lessened predation as described by Paine (1974). Conversely, predation
intensity would increase on smaller and more sun-protected prey species such as
Chthamalus.
Possible f√ºrther experiments would be to monitor feeding of N. emarginata at
more time points, specifically during high tides. A field experiment with plots of snails
subjected to added heat stress could show behavioral changes experimentally.
Laboratory studies involving thermal tolerance, lethal temperatures, or heat shock protein
production in Nucella would give insight into physiological mechanisms underlying
thermal stress.
