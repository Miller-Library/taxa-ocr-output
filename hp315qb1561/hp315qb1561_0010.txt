sudden, as there were days when the sun-exposed temperatures approached 28° C and as
much as 50% of the population was still exposed and feeding.
The extent of sun-exposure (and extent of thermal stress) correlates with prey size
and handling time. N. emarginata does not respond as strongly to the temperature
threshold when there is the prospect of a high food reward. Mytilus is the largest prey
species, averaging 14 mm larger and 2 days longer handling time than the barnacles
(West 1986). Although absolute feeding rates declined quickly at higher temperatures,
feeding on Mytilus rose from 22% of total prey consumed below 28° C to 62% above this
threshold temperature. This implies that whelks may tolerate a greater thermal risk if
they have already invested considerable time in drilling a large prey or if the risk is offset
by a greater potential food reward. The existence of such tradeoffs would bear further
investigation.
The large differences in feeding rates between mid-day and early/late day spring
tides are likely due to the increased emersion time associated with these tides. Longer
emersion time corresponds to a greater thermal risk associated with feeding. Feeding
rates were not significantly different between mid-day and early/late day neap tides, as
exposure to air was relatively short and high temperatures are less of a threat.
The transplant experiments show that individual N. emarginata maintain their
threshold response even in an unfamiliar environment. When placed in the new
environment, the transplanted snails were able to both detect a threatening temperature
and find appropriate shelter (average exposed temperature of 31.2° C the day following
transplantation). For the week following the transplant, experimental snails did not move
from the sheltered regions they had found the first day. This was the case even on days
