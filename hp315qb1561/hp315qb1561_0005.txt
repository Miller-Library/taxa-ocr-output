In addition to observing daily feeding activity, I noted each individual snail's sun
exposure as well as the characteristic snail body temperature at that exposure. Areas of
rock were deemed sun-exposed if they received direct sunlight throughout most day time
low tides in May (only shaded during very early morning or late afternoon daytime low
tides). Protected areas were those that rarely received direct sunlight. Since I did not
want to disturb feeding activity, I was unable to measure snail body temperatures
directly. For this measurement I used gelatin (Knoxß brand) filled N. emarginata shells
as a proxy for snail body temperature. Prior temperature tests of the gelatin snail
consistently fell within 0.5’C below the actual snail body temperatures (allowing 2
minutes equilibration time). The small difference is due to the relatively minor thermal
inertia of gastropods. In order to determine the temperature regime at different sun
exposures, 1 performed a daily transect of temperature measurements across each site,
Temperatures of the gelatin snail were taken at both sun-exposed and protected areas
every 0.5 m along the transect line. Transects ran both across the length and the width of
each site. I used a digital microprocessor thermocouple for the temperature readings.
Prevailing tidal heights and timing, as well as daily weather, cloud cover, and surf
conditions were also noted.
Prey Abundance and Distribution
In order to assess the relative abundances of each of the major prey species, I
performed a survey of each site. This was done with a 0.25 m2 quadrat positioned
repeatedly over different sections of the site until the whole site was surveyed. First,
percentage of quadrat that was sun-exposed or protected was noted. Then percent cover
of each prey species (Chthamalus fissus and Cthamalus dalli were lumped as one prey
