species) within each exposure was determined. Total areas of each quadrat were then
summed across the entire site.
Transplant Experiment
1 performed a transplant experiment in order to differentiate between site-specific
temperature/exposure responses and general environmental responses. I moved 8
experimental N. emarginata (4 from each sun-protected and sun-exposed areas) from Site
1 to Site 2 and placed them in comparable exposure regimes. A control group was
removed from the substrate for the same amount of time as the experimental group, but
was subsequently returned to the same location on the rock. I then monitored the
responses of the two groups for 2 weeks following the transplant.
Results
Temperature Patterns
Temperatures varied significantly both among different days of the study as well
as within different sun-exposures of each site (Table 1, Fig.1). Average temperatures
ranged from 16.1° C to 32.8° C in sun-exposed areas and from 13.8° C to 21.2° C in
protected areas. Temperatures of sun-exposed areas were always greater than those in
protected areas (mean difference of 7.5° C), with the greatest differences on the warmest
days (11-May and 21-May). On a given day, temperatures were consistent between sites
at each exposure level.
Prey Abundance
Prey abundances varied among different sun-exposures. Abundances were
substantially greater in sun-exposed areas of Site 1 (Fig. 2). Sun-exposed prey accounted
