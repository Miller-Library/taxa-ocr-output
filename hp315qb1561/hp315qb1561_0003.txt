community structure (Kerfoot and Sih 1987, Lubchenco and Real 1991). The genus
Nucella is an important predator on the Pacific coast (Spight 1974, Palmer 1983, and
Navarette 1996), as well as in New England (Menge 1983) and Britain (Connell 1961).
The objectives of this study were: (1) To correlate feeding behavior in N.
emarginata with physical factors such as temperature and sun exposure. (2) To identify
thresholds that limit exposure to high temperatures. The results suggest that N.
emarginata are sensitive to sub-lethal temperatures and limit their sun exposure when
temperatures exceed a critical threshold. Furthermore, this exposure response to
temperature is tightly correlated with feeding since most large prey occur in sun¬
exposed, thermally hazardous microhabitats.
Materials and Methods
Study Sites and Biota
This study was carried out in Pacific Grove, California (36°36' N, 121°54' W).
Study sites were on the protected shore next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium on the
property of Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. Study sites were examined
during each period of lowest day time low water between 6 May and 23 May 2003. Site
1 is a 5 m2 cluster of small, compact granitic boulders located at 0.75 m above mean low
water. Site 2 is a 6 m2 large cement piling surrounded by sand, characterized by flat rock
and fewer cracks and crevices than Site 1. Site 2 is located at 0.90 m above mean low
water. The 2 sites are separated by 50 meters and consist of similar abundance of
Chthamalus spp., Balanus glandula, and Mytilus californianus, the major prey species of
Nucella emarginata. Öther species present at each site are the gastropods Tegula
