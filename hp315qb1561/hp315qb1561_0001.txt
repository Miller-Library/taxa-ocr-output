Abstract
1 studied the effects of temperature stress associated with sun-exposure on feeding
behavior in the carnivorous intertidal whelk, Nucella emarginata. Seventy individual
whelks were marked and observed at each day-time low tide over a 3 week period at 2
wave protected sites at Hopkins Marine Station. Temperatures ranged from «15° C on
cold, overcast days to 230° C on calm, sunny days. Temperatures of sun-exposed regions
of each site averaged 7.5° C warmer than sun-protected regions, with the greatest
differences on the warmest days. Most larger prey of N. emarginata (Balanus glandula
and Mytilus californianus) were more abundant is sun-exposed regions while smaller
prey species (Chthamalus spp.) were more abundant is sun-protected areas. Proportions
of marked whelks that were feeding varied widely between 5 and 68% on days when
exposed temperature was below 28° C. Above 28° C, however, percent feeding never
exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. Whelks that remained feeding
in sun exposed areas at the higher temperatures fed predominately on larger, more
valuable prey that can take several days to drill and consume, thus experiencing greater
potential thermal stress. Whelks transplanted to a nearby site traveled farther than control
whelks and sought appropriate shelter before the next low tide (avg. temp = 31.2° C).
They remained more sedentary than controls for the week following transplant, after
which they resumed foraging similar to the controls. These results suggest that N.
emarginata is conservative in its response to high temperatures during low tide. The
response does, however, limit the time available for feeding on larger prey. Consistently
warmer temperatures could serve to shift the preferred prey species.
