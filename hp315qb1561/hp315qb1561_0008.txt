between time of day during neap tides are not significant (P=.30, t-test), nor are there
overall differences between spring and neap tides pooled over times of day. There were
87 feeding events during spring tides and 72 during the neap tides (8 days of each tide).
Temperature and Behavior
Feeding and sun exposure were each dependent on the sun-exposed temperature.
On colder days there was very little correlation between temperature and sun exposure
(Fig. 6). When the average exposed temperature was below 28째 C, proportions of snails
that were sun exposed varied from 10 to 70%. Above 28째 C, however, percent sun
exposed rarely exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. This relationship
is reflected in the feeding data. While there is no relationship between feeding and
temperature on colder days, no more than 10% of the population at either site fed on days
when the exposed average temperature exceeded 28째 C (Fig. 7). As with sun exposure,
feeding rates declined as temperatures rose higher. The dominant prey species also
differed substantially with increased temperatures (Fig. 6). Below 28째 C, Mytilus
accounted for 22% of prey consumed, while Balanus and Chthamalus accounted for 48%
and 28% of prey, respectively. (Fig 8) When the sun-exposed temperature exceeded 28
C, Mytilus accounted for 62% of consumed prey, with Balanus and Chthamalus at only
5% and 12%.
Transplant Experiment
Snails were transplanted to both exposed and protected areas of Site 2. The day
following transplant, when average sun-exposed temperature was 31.2' C, each of the
transplanted snails found protected regions of the new site. The transplanted snails also
traveled significantly longer distances than the control snails (Pk.O1, t-test) to reach them
