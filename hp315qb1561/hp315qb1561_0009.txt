(Fig. 9). From the start of the first day, transplanted snails traveled an average of 0.45 m
while the control snails averaged about 0.17 m. During subsequent days, the transplanted
snails did not move from the sheltered regions they had found the first day, even on days
when the control group was sun exposed and/or feeding. Äfter one week the transplanted
snails resumed feeding rates similar to those of the controls.
Discussion
Since the majority of their prey inhabit sun-exposed areas, feeding by N.
emarginata results in increased sun exposure. This exposure poses a potential thermal
stress during low tide when temperatures are higher. The potential stress varies with prey
species, since Mytilus and Balanus live predominantly in sun-exposed areas while
Chthamalus is slightly more abundant in sun-protected regions. This is a common
situation in the intertidal, where many prey species have spatial refuges in areas that are
too harsh for their predators, but still hospitable enough for them. The best known
example is that of the predatory sea star Pisaster ochraceous and its prey species, Mytilus
(Paine 1974)
The extent of thermal stress associated with feeding depends on temperatures
during low tide. Low tide temperatures vary markedly from day to day, as well as
between sun-exposed and protected areas. These fluctuations appear to affect feeding by
N. emarginata only when temperatures exceed 28° C. Below this temperature, there is
very little correlation between temperature and sun exposure, while fewer than 10% of
the whelks fed during temperatures above 28° C. The transition appears to be very
