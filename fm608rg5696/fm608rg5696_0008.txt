Pigmentation in N. grubei

of known carotenoids gave negative tests for carotenoids when
combined with the unknown pigment. Carotenoids may be pre¬
sent and not detectable because of inadequate purification.
Yet the green color (a possible carotenoprotein) would
neither extract with water nor buffer solutions, both used
to extract green carotenoproteins. (Cheesman, Lee, Zagalsky
1967).
The same argument of insufficient purification holds in
the attempt to characterize the unknown as chromolipoids. In
this case, however, many tests (solvent solubilities, conc.
HSO. SbCl3, and Sudan Black B staining) indicate their pre-
sence. It is not known what effects impurities would have
on chromolipoid detection. Yellow chromolipoids in the poly¬
chaete Thoracophelia mucronata were found by Fox, Crane and
MoConnaughney (1948). A green chromolipoid was found by
Tessier (1929) in a number of hydroids. It is not known
whether a chromolipoid could be responsible for a green color
and subsequent change to yellow with acetone extraction.
Sterols are known to absorb in ultraviolet light and
though these should have been removed by saponification.
their presence may be responsible for the high spectral
absorption in the ultraviolet region.
