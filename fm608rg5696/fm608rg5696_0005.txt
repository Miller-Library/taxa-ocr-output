Pigmentation in N. grubei

cells (Dales 1954). Granule sizes found in N. grubei are an
an order of magnitude greater than those found by Dales in
N. diversicolor.
Extracted orange pigment of body wall: This pigment
gave a negative Gmelin reaction and was soluble in acetone,
hexane, chloroform, slightly soluble in ethanol, and insol¬
üble in water. The spectrum obtained in acetone is shown in
Fig. 2. In hexane under UV (Black Ray UVL 21, Ultraviolet
Products Inc.) the pigment gave a bluish fluorescence on
the top layer and a green fluorescence in a lower layer.
Addition of conc. H,SO gave a color change from yellow to
cloudy orange, not the blue or green characteristic of car¬
otenoids. Addition of SbCla also failed to give a blue re¬
action and instead cloudy orange. The pigment was stained by
Sudan Black B.
Chromatography (25% acetone in hexane) revealed four
colored bands with the Re values shown in Fig. 3. In hexane
all solutions were pale yellow, band two (Re 0.46) was the
most highly colored.
Viewed in ultraviolet light the chromatograph revealed
extensive fluorescent impurities throughout the eluted zone.
Fluorescence varied from green and blue to a bright purple
band between bands two (Rg 0.46) and one (Rg 0.34).
The data and tests obtained from the chromatograph after
elution with methanol are given in Table 1. The control is
