Pigmentation in N. grubei
K. Carlson
was chromatographed on 500 preparative silica plates with
fluorescent-indicator and developed with 25% acetone in hex¬
ane. Relevant tests and spectra were obtained from the de-
veloped bands.
The green pigment remaining was extracted with 5% HOl
in methanol to give in solution a bright green color. This
green solution was extracted into chloroform by addition of
water. The Gmelin reaction (Fox 1953), zinc acetate-iodine
test (With 1968), and conc. HoSOp destruction were carried out.
Spectra were obtained in acidified methanol.
Only blue colored eggs were used for extraction. They
were rinsed over a glass filter and ground with distilled
water. When rinsed the eggs immediately turned to yellow-green.
Removed to a phosphate buffer (KHoPOL and Na»HPOL) pH 7 ac¬
cording to the procedure of Lee (1966) followed by centri¬
fugation (Gilchrist 1968) failed to extract the pigment in-
to the aqueous solution. Acetone was added, yielding a clear
yellow solution; repeated extraction removed all color from
residue. A preliminary drying was carried out with sodium
sulfate. Purification and characterization were done as
with the body wall orange pigment.
Results
The green color of N. grubei has two components: a
darker color found in the body wall and in particles within
the coelom, and a blue-green color found in both the body
