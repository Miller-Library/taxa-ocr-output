wall and eggs of spawning females. These colors were extrac¬
ted and analyzed separately. The darker color was found to
be biliverdin, as Dales (1954) found in Nereis diversicolor,
and the blue-green color was due to unidentified pigments ex¬
hibiting many properties of the chromolipoids.
Dark green pigment of body wall: The spectrum in 5%HCl/
methanol gave the following peaks:
369 sharp
690-700 broad
This absorption closely resembles the spectrum of known
biliverdin (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). Both
spectra are shown in Fig. 1. The Gmelin test for bile pig-
ments was positive and a red fluorescence indicating a bila¬
triene was obtained after addition of zinc acetate and iodine.
Destruction by conc. HoSOp distinguished this pigment from
mesobiliverdin.
The biliverdin pigment in N. grubei occurs as granules
of varying sizes, often 9-10u, throughout the body wall. Con-
centrations of biliverdin are found anteriorally, the dorsal
side. This is in contrast to Dales (1954) who found less
biliverdin in this area and instead a darker color due to
carotenoids. Also, large (usually 2504) particles of very
concentrated pigment were found free in the coelom. When the
green color was dissolved away from these particles mucous
like fragments remained. Most probably these are coelomic
