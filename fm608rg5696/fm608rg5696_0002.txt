igmentation in N. grube

Introduction
Theevivid green color of the polychaete worm Nereis grubei
during its spawning season has been noted by many authors (Reish
1954, Schroeder 1968). Gould and Schroeder (1968) observed an
oocyte color change of blue to yellow green during matura¬
tion. During this time the color of oocytes tends to dom¬
inate the normal year-round darker green color of the body wall.
The purpose of this work is to determine the nature of the
colored pigments in spawning females of Nereis grubei.
Materials and Methods
Nereis grubei containing eggs were collected in gastro¬
clonium holdfasts at Hopkins Marine Station and Stillwater
Cove, Monterey County, California. Eggs were removed from
forty worms by pipette and their bodies cleaned by washing
with Instant Ocean. Both body wall and eggs were frozen un-
til used.
The body walls were extracted with cold acetone (5°C)
while grinding, yielding an orange solution. A green color
remained. The procedure of Bingham (1975) was followed in
attempting to purify the orange body wall extract. Spectra
were taken in acetone with a Beckman DK-2A spectrophotometer,
Tests of H,SO, addition (Fox 1953), SbCl3 addition (Fox,Crane,
and McConnaughney 1948), and staining by Sudan Black B (Work
and Work 1969) on filter paper were used. The unknown pigment
