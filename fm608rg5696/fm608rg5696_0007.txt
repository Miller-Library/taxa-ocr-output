Pigmentation in N. grubei
K. Carlson
that the same area is darkened by N. grubei, although in
this case colored by biliverdin. Protective coloration seems
likely. Shorebirds were seen feeding in the algal fields from
which N. grubei were collected. The biliverdin matches well
with the light to dark green color of gastroclonium holdfasts.
Though gastroclonium was found to vary in color from yellow-
green to dark green to brown, its holdfasts retained the same
green color. During the spawning season (February to June
when females become a noticable bright blue-green, Schroeder
(1968) found an N. grubei migration to gastroclonium from
the brown colored kelp Egregia menziesii. Migration to a
protectively colored environment is well correlated with color
development by spawning females.
The oocyte color change during maturation seems to be
the result of structural differences in the tissues. Along
with this color change Gould and Schroeder (1969) found inÂ¬
tensive stratification of the cytoplasm in mature oocytes.
Evidence presented here, based on co-chromatography and
spectral similarities, indicates that the blue-green color
in body wall and oocytes of N. grubei results from the same
pigments.
Because of impurities, I was unable to satisfactorally
characterize the blue-green color of body wall and eggs of
N. grubei. After chemical tests, insufficient color remained
to purify by re-chromatographing. Experiments with controls
