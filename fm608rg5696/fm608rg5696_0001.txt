Pigmentation in N. grubei
K. Carlson
Abstract
Pigmentation in the polychaete worm Nereis grubei has
two components. The dark green bile pigment biliverdin
occurs in granules in the body wall and in the coelom.
An unidentified blue-green pigment was found in the body wall
and in oocytes of spawning females. Protective coloration
is enhanced by both biliverdin and the unknown pigment.
Structural differences appear to be responsible for the color
change during oocyte maturation in Nereis grubei.
