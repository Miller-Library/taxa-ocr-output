Pigmentation in N. grubei
K. Carlson
from material eluted from an undeveloped silica gel plate.
Pigment of Oocytes: Yellow-green eggs collected from a
small number of N. grubei when frozen turned reversibly to the
blue color of the less mature oocytes.
After extraction of the blue colored eggs the yellow
solution in acetone gave the absorption spectra shown in Fig.
2. Under ultraviolet light the hexane solution fluoresced
whitish purple. Addition of conc. HoSO,, gave a change of
yellow to cloudy orange. Addition of SbCl, yielded an orange
brown solution. The pigment was stained by Sudan Black B.
Co-chromatography with the unknown body pigment revealed
identical bands both in visible and ultraviolet light.
Discussion
The biliverdin in N. diversicolor was found by Dales
(1954) to be derived from hemoglobin. Considering the simÂ¬
ilarities of occurence it seems reasonable to assume the same
derivation for the biliverdin found in N. grubei. It is not
known whether the amount of biliverdin in N. grubei increases
in sexual epitoky during the spawning season as in N.
diversicolor. The large particles found in the coelom seem
to indicate that large amounts of biliverdin are in the pro-
cess of being removed to the gut (Dales 1954).
In N. diversicolor Dales (1954) found a darker area
dorsally and anteriorally, due to carotenoids, and speculated
its role was protective coloration. It is interesting to note
