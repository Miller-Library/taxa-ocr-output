CONCLUSIONS
In studying the role of the cholinergic receptor/nitric oxide/cGMP pathway in
regulating neurite outgrowth of the NIE-115 cell line, it was discovered that cells
stimulated with different nitric oxide donors exhibited varied forms of growth. It was
observed that cells treated with DEANO and Spermine NONOate expanded lamellipodia
and demonstrated maturation of lamellipodia through neurite formation and extension.
Growth of the main shafts of processes, however, was inhibited. Contrarily, it was
observed that in SNAP, the main shafts of processes elongated, generally remained
unbranched, and were thick in diameter. Growth of neurites from lamellipodia, however,
was arrested. It was also observed that both carbachol and cGMP arrested neurite
outgrowth. This study suggests that nitric oxide affects growth through a pathway other
than the cGMP pathway. Evidence suggests that cholinergic stimulation activates
additional pathways that mask the effects of nitric oxide, and that these other pathways
play a role in inhibiting neurite outgrowth.
