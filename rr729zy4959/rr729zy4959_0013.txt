Further evidence for this hypothesis lies in the effect of cGMP. It is widely
accepted that nitric oxide activates guanylyl cyclase and consequently stimulates the
production of cGMP (Moncada et al., 1991). However, the present study has shown that
cells stimulated with 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane permeable form of cGMP, demonstrate
neither the growth found in cells treated with nitric oxide donors nor that seen in controls
This suggests that nitric oxide regulates neurite outgrowth through a pathway other than
CGMP.
Previous research has shown that the NIE-115 cell line express other receptors in
addition to the nitric oxide-cGMP coupled MI receptor. Yasuda et al have shown that
NIE-115 cells express 15% MI and 65% M4. The M4 muscarinic receptor is coupled to
the down regulation of cAMP, but not to a calcium response [14 Other research has
demonstrated that intracellular cAMP promotes neurite outgrowth, expansion of
lamellipodia, and motility [1. By this line of thought, stimulation of MA receptors by
carbachol might arrest growth by causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. It has
also been shown that NIE-115 cells express nicotinic receptors [8]. Though not much is
known about these receptors, it is generally accepted that they possess distinct functional
properties. Their activation by carbachol may, in turn, play a role in neurite outgrowth
regulation.
