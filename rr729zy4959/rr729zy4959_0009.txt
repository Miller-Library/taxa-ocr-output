Carbachol and cGMP arrest growth
The outgrowth exhibited by cells in PBS was almost entirely absent in carbachol-
and cGMP-treated cells. Almost all neurite outgrowth was inhibited upon stimulation
with carbachol (see figure 5). This result was observed both in cells that had a calcium
concentration increase upon stimulation (as detected with fura-2 imaging), as well as in
cells that did not. Likewise, almost all neurite outgrowth was arrested in cGMP-treated
cells (see figure 6).
Rapid Cell Death
A few examples of rapid cell death (RCD) was observed in the experiments. This
phenomenon is characterized by the speed with which the onset of dying becomes
apparent and RCD takes over the fate of the cell. The initiation of RCD can be detected
within two minutes - the time interval between frames.
The observed RCD can be divided into two distinct categories: flat cell death and
cluster cell death. Flat cell death (see figure 7) occurs to what the present study terms flat
cells -flat, thin, roughly-circular cells with broad, thin lamellipodia spread out along the
entire circumference. This type of RCD is characterized by the retraction of all processes
and an implosion into a round, compact form. Flat cells that die in this manner are in
contact with either the neurites or the soma of non-flat cells. The retraction that occurs
upon death is often observed to pull at attached neurites and cell bodies. Four instances of
flat cell death was observed: three in one SNAP experiment and one in a PBS control.
The second type of death, cluster cell death, occurs to undifferentiated cells growing in a
