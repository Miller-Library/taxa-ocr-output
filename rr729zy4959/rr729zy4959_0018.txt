Figure 4. SNAP (100 um) inhibits the growth of neurites from lamellipodia. A: An image
taken at start of SNAP stimulation. B: Two hours after stimulation, the main shafts of
processes had elongated while remaining unbranched and thick in diameter (arrows in A).
No neurite growth from lamellipodia is observed. Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies
to A & B.
Figure 5. Carbachol (1 mM during first 15 minutes of stimulation, 20 uM constant
perfusion afterwards) arrests growth. A: An image taken at start of carbachol stimulation.
B: Two hours after stimulation, no significant neurite outgrowth was observed.
Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies to A & B.
Figure 6. Cyclic GMP (1 mM during first 15 minutes of stimulation, 20 uM constant
perfusion afterwards) arrests growth. A: An image taken at start of cGMP stimulation. B:
Two hours after stimulation, no significant neurite outgrowth was observed. Calibration
bar in A, 20 um, and applies to A & B.
Figure 7. Flat cell death in PBS. A: An image taken at the start of PBS control: a and b
point to neurites of neighboring non-flat cells, c points to the cell body of a flat cell. B:
After 90 minutes of growth in PBS, neurites of neighboring non-flat cells (a, b in A) had
grown to make contact with the lamellipodia ruffle of the flat cell. C: After two hours of
growth in control conditions, the flat cell was dead. Note the characteristic compact,
round shape of a dead flat cell. Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies to A-C.
