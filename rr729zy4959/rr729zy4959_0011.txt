DISCUSSION
Rapid cell death
Due to the low frequency of rapid cell death, no conclusions can be drawn as to
the trends that may govern its occurrence. It is possible that the two morphologically
distinct types of RCD are governed by different mechanisms. Since it appears that only flat
cells and undifferentiated cluster cells are subject to RCD, it is conceivable that those
particular cell types possess or lack a certain quality, rendering them more susceptible.
This quality may be correlated with the developmental stage, environment, treatment,
and/or intercellular interactions
That one cluster cell death often triggers other similar deaths in the same group
suggests that there is intercellular communication between cells of the same cloning
cluster. This communication may occur via gap junctions. It is also possible that the cell
contents released by one cluster cell death triggers cluster cell deaths in susceptible cells in
the surrounding area.
Death of flat cells appears to be dependent on direct contact with the neurites
and/or cell bodies of non-flat cells. This suggests that non-flat cells may cause flat cell
death via a transmitted signal, and that this signal can travel through neurite and soma
membranes.
Concentration dependence of NO
The three NO donors release nitric oxide for different lengths of time, at varied
concentrations. DEANO, with a half life of 2.1 minutes, releases high concentrations of
NO for a short period of time. DEANO will have released most of its nitric oxide after 15
