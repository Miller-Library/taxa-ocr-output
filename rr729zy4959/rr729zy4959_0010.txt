cloning group (see figure 8). Undifferentiated cells are defined here to be cells without
processes. This type of death is characterized by a sudden bursting and bubbling, followed
by continuous blebbing until the end of the time-lapse series In addition, it was found that
one cluster cell death was often followed by other cluster cell deaths within the same
group. Examples of cluster cell death were found in one SNAP, one Spermine NONOate,
and one DEANO experiment.
