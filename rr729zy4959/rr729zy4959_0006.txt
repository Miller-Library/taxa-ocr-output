Growth in PBS was considered as the control for all the treatments. Triplicate
experiments using PBS were performed and recorded for the same total number of frames
as for the treatment experiments.
Neurite Outgrowth Assay
After the initial 18-minute PBS control period, the test compound was added.
Saline containing 100 uM DEANO was introduced into the chamber and allowed 20
minutes to react, after which constant perfusion with PBS was resumed. 1OOuM NO
donor Spermine NONOate was applied using constant perfusion. Nitric oxide donor S-
nitroso-N-acetylpenacillamine, at 10OuM in 1% DMSO, was also added using constant
perfusion. The cyclic GMP analog, 8-Br-cGMP, was added at a concentration of ImM
and allowed to react for 15 minutes before switching to constant perfusion at 20 uM.
Cells treated with carbachol were first incubated with Fura-2 (SuM) for 30 minutes on a
shaker table in the dark before experimentation. At addition of carbachol, the cells were
viewed with a 20X Fluor objective under UV light and video taped (Panasonic VHS) to
record calcium concentration increases in responding cells: the cells were recorded for
approximately 5 seconds at 340 nm before stimulation (to obtain background
fluorescence), and for one minute at 380 nm upon addition of carbachol. Carbachol was
added at an initial concentration of 1 mM and allowed to react for 15 minutes before
starting constant perfusion at 20 uM. Triplicate experiments were performed for each test
compound. Cells were time-lapse recorded for an additional two hours from time of
stimulation.
