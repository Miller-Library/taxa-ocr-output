Figure 8. Cluster cell death in DEANO. A-B: Initiation of cluster cell death in cell 1 is
evident within 2 minutes (images A and B were taken two minutes apart, at the start of
DEANO stimulation). B-D: Progression of cluster cell death in cell 1 for the next 30
minutes, marked by bubbling and blebbing. E: Initiation of cluster cell death in cell 2, also
marked by explosive bubbling. E-F: Progression of cluster cell death in both cells until the
end of the two-hour time-lapse. Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies to A-F.
