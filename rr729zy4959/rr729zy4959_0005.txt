and PBS was added immediately to prevent drying out of the cells. A field containing as
many distinct cells as possible, of varied morphologies and with visible processes, was
selected. Time-lapse video (Panasonic VHS) and optical disk (Panasonic OMDR)
recordings were made simultaneously, at a rate of one frame every two minutes, using
Nomarski D.I.C. optics and a Hammatsu C2400 SIT camera. A total of 69 frames was
recorded for each treatment, 9 frames before and 60 frames after stimulation The images
were acquired with a 20X bright field objective at low light intensities and at a controlled
temperature of 30°C. A pipeline image processor (Megavision, Santa Barbara, CA) was
used to digitize images, and its application programs were used for analysis of the entire
time series. Select images were converted into bitmap files and transferred to Adobe
Photoshop 3.0. Measurements and further analysis were done using Photoshop
applications. Digitally processed images were printed from an HP LaserJet AMV printer.
Controls
It was found that the length of time the cells were in the well for video time-
lapsing (-2.5 hours), coupled with the temperature of 30°C, increased the osmolarity of
the bathing solution by more than 25%. To control for this effect, all experiments were
done under constant perfusion (rate - 7.5 mL/hr) with the bathing solution.
Because different cells have varied basal motility, an 18-minute control period of
growth in PBS was recorded for each experiment prior to treatment, against which growth
during the 18 minutes after treatment was compared. The control period was used to
compare basal growth rates between experiments.
