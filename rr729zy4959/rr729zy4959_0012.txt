minutes. Spermine NONOate, with a half life of 39 minutes, releases lower concentrations
of nitric oxide for a longer period of time. The rate of release quickly plateaus, resulting
in a steady, low rate of release. SNAP is also a long term donor, releasing even lower
levels of nitric oxide for an even longer period of time
Since different results were obtained using Sperno and SNAP, although both are
slow-release molecules, this suggests that the effects of nitric oxide are concentration
dependent. SNAP, consistently releasing lower levels of NO, inhibits the extension of
thin, branching neurites from lamellipodia. In contrast, Sperno, releasing higher levels of
nitric oxide, inhibits the elongation of the main shaft of processes. That cells grown in
DEANO, the quick-release, high-level NO donor, and Sperno both exhibit the same
changes in growth behaviors suggests that the duration of stimulus is not as crucial as the
concentration of NO release.
Another cholinergic pathway masks effects of nitric oxide
Previous research has demonstrated that nitric oxide production is coupled with
the calcium concentration increase that occurs upon stimulation of MI muscarinic
receptors with carbachol [41. This study has found, however, that cells responding to
carbachol with a calcium increase, and hence producing nitric oxide, exhibit neither the
growth found in cells treated with nitric oxide donors nor that found in control conditions.
This observation, coupled with the fact that carbachol arrested growth even in cells that
did not show a calcium response, suggests that another cholinergic signal is involved in
regulating neurite outgrowth, and that this signal masks the effects of nitric oxide
