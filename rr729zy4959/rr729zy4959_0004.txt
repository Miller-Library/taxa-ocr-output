MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and diethylamine nitric oxide, sodium salt
(DEANO) were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA)
Spermine NONOate was from Alexis (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). Carbachol and 8-Bromo¬
cyclic GMP were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.).
Cell Culture
Mouse neuroblastoma clone NIE-115 cells (from UCSF Cell Culture Facility)
were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO
U.S.A.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide. Cells were
plated onto glass cover slips and placed in 35 mm plastic tissue culture dishes (Falcon,
Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ). Cells grown to-60% confluency were
then differentiated by treating with 2% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). All cells were
cultured for at least 3 days before use and fed one day before use.
Time-Lapse Video/OMDR Microscopy
Immediately before each experiment, a glass chip was selected from one of the
plastic culture dishes containing differentiated cells and placed in 10 mM HEPES buffer
(phosphate buffered saline, PBS) at pH 7.4. The chip was then transferred to a well that
fits into the stage of the microscope (Nikon Diaphot) and secured with a small amount of
petroleum jelly applied to the edges of the chip. This well was then placed onto the stage
