INTRODUCTION
In the cholinergic receptor/nitric oxide/cGMP pathway, the muscarinic cholinergic
receptor, Ml, is coupled to the activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS catalyzes
the conversion of L-arginine into L-citrulline and nitric oxide gas Nitric oxide, in turn,
has been shown to be coupled to the activation of guanylyl cyclase and the production of
cyclic GMP [3,5,1 1), as well as several other, less well-characterized actions [21.
Finally,
cyclic GMP acts as a signal molecule for opening and closing membrane channels
The present study investigates the role of nitric oxide in regulating neurite
outgrowth in the NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Along with other receptors,
NIE-115 cells express the Ml receptor. Previous studies conducted on the role of this
pathway in neurite outgrowth regulation have been inconsistent. While it has been
suggested that cGMP inhibits motility and causes neurite retraction in NIE-115 cells 111.
other research have found that cGMP promotes neurite extension and motility in rat dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) neurons [121. It has been shown that carbachol inhibits the growth-
promoting effects of forskolin in human neuroblastoma NB-OKI cells [71, yet
acetylcholinesterase promotes regeneration of neurites in cultured adult neurons of
Aplysia [10]. The effects of nitric oxide on neurite outgrowth have also been
controversial. While studies have shown that NO arrests growth of neuronal cells during
differentiation 6,9 and inhibits extension of regenerating axons of rat DRG neurons [131,
other research has indicated that nitric oxide promotes neurite extension and motility in rat
DRG neurons [121
The present study investigates the role of nitric oxide on neurite outgrowth by
examining three points along the MI receptor cascade: (1) at the level of the muscarinic
