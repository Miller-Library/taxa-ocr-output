ABSTRACT
The NIE-115 mouse neuroblastoma cell line was used to investigate the role of the
cholinergic receptor/ nitric oxide/cyclic GMP pathway in regulating neurite outgrowth.
Here evidence is presented that both carbachol and 8-Bromo-cGMP inhibit neurite
outgrowth. Nitric oxide donors, however, promote various forms of neurite outgrowth.
DEANO and Spermine NONOate were shown to promote neurite outgrowth from
lamellipodia, but had no effect on neurites that did not possess lamellipodia before
administration of the donors. SNAP was shown to allow growth of the main shafts of
neurites, but not that of lamellipodia or their extended neurites. This study suggests that
nitric oxide promotes growth through a cGMP-independent pathway. During activation
of cholinergic receptors, the stimulatory effects of nitric oxide appear to be masked by
other pathways in the cholinergic cascade.
