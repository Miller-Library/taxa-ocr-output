Figure 1. Nomarski D.I.C. Ã–MDR images showing neurite outgrowth in PBS. A: An
image taken at start of PBS control. The cells possessed lamellipodia (a, b, c, d), as well
as neurites without lamellipodia. B: After two hours of PBS treatment, the cells showed
significant amount of growth. Neurites initiated and extended from lamellipodia (a, b in
A), lamellipodia expanded (d in A), and processes elongated (e in A). Frequently, entire
lamellipodia developed into fine, highly-branched neurites (c in A). Calibration bar in A,
20 um, and applies to A & B.
Figure 2. DEANO (100 um) inhibits growth of main shafts of processes. A: An image
taken at start of DEANO stimulation. B: Two hours after stimulation, lamellipodia had
initiated and extended thin, branched neurites (a in A). The main shafts of processes,
however, remained the same length (b in A). Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies to
A & B.
Figure 3. Spermine NONOate (100 um) inhibits growth of main shafts of processes. A:
An image taken at start of Spermine NONOate stimulation. B: Two hours after
stimulation, lamellipodia had initiated and extended neurites (a, b in A). The main shafts
of processes, however, did not elongate (c in A). Calibration bar in A, 20 um, and applies
to A & B.
