RESULTS
Cells grown in the PBS control exhibited a significant amount of growth, which
manifested itself in a variety of ways (see figure 1). Initiation and extension of neurites
from lamellipodia was observed. The number of neurites sprouting from each
lamellipodium varied, but they were oftentimes delicate and finely branched. Frequently,
instead of the neurites growing out from the ends of the lamellipodia, entire lamellipodia
would develop into these highly-branched neurites, suggesting that the process is one
involving the maturation of motile lamellipodia into neurites. Branches off the main shafts
of processes lengthened in PBS, as well as the main shafts themselves, regardless of the
original process length. Elongation and broadening of lamellipodia was also observed.
DEANO, Spermine NONOate, and SNAP Inhibit SpecificTypes of Growth
Cells grown in DEANO and Spermine NONOate exhibited the same types of
growth (see figures 2 & 3). In either treatment, neurites are seen to extend and elongate
from lamellipodia. As with cells grown in PBS, it is sometimes observed that entire
lamellipodia develop into thin, distinct processes. Also analogous to the control, these
neurites often appear delicate and finely branched. Both DEANO and Spermine
NONOate, however, appear to inhibit growth in the main shafts of processes.
Growth of neuronal cells treated with SNAP was different from that of cells
treated with DEANO and Spermine NONOate (see figure 4). Unlike DEANO and Sperno,
SNAP did not inhibit elongation of the main shafts of processes. As these processes
extended, they did not branch and remained thick in diameter. It was observed, however,
that SNAP did arrest the maturation and branching of lamellipodia.
