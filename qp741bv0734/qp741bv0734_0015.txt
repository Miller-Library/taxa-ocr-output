half of the day. Air temperature in Oregon would most likely be colder, but the effects of
air temperature on mussel growth, respiration, and MDH activity are unknown. However.
air temperature during this winter probably did not reach high enough temperatures to
cause any heat stress on the mussels.
This research provides a baseline for future work. Äfter a transplant that lasted
through winter and summer, the major growth period, the mussels could be measured
again. By the summer, any acclimation effect would likely be eliminated (Pickens 1965).
and any remaining differences between mussel populations might then reflect genetically
fixed differences. Non-genetic factors (e.g. gill size) that were initially set by
environment could then have lasting effects, unrelated to thermal acclimation. In
addition, the physiological tests could be repeated to show whether growth correlated
with respiration and MDH activity during a season of greater growth. Other indicators of
growth and physiology could also be used such as heart rate, calorimetry, and RNA:DNA
ratios. An enzyme that indicates only aerobic metabolism such as citrate synthase (CS)
might be more directly related to oxygen consumption than MDH. To research how
temperature changes affect growth, temperature could be directly manipulated in
laboratory experiments. The influence of age is another factor that should be examined.
By transplanting very young mussels, any age discrepancy would be reduced and
observed growth rates may be more reflective of actual population differences.
M. californianus is currently thought of as a genetically uniform species despite
its broad range in distribution. However, the field growth results of this research and
Sanford’s study suggest intrinsic differences between populations could exist. Further
research may suggest that M. californianus should be included in a growing body of
