study during the summer (Sanford, unpub. data), the summer growth was over 3.5 times
faster than the winter growth for these populations of M. californianus.
Acclimatization has been hypothesized as one of the reasons that mussels from
Oregon grow faster than the mussels from California. During the February
transplantation, the Oregon mussels were coming from water that was 2.5°C colder
(Fig. 8) so that the difference in growth could have been due to acclimation. However,
Sanford's study in 2000 that showed a dramatic difference in growth, actually had
Oregon mussels being transplanted to a colder climate than what they had experienced
(due to earlier onset of spring upwelling in Central California), suggesting that the
differences in growth could not have been due to acclimatization.
Another interesting finding of my study was that mussels grew faster in Hopkins
Marine Life Refuge than ones at Soberanes Point. Hopkins Marine Life Refuge is in
Monterey Bay whereas Soberanes Point is on the open coast, where water temperatures
are often over 2°C cooler (Sanford, unpub data).
Because age can play a role in growth rate, it may also be a factor in why Oregon
mussels seem to grow faster. Younger mussels grow faster than older mussels (Morris et
al. 1980, Sukhotin and Pörtner 2001). Therefore, if mussels grow faster in Oregon
because of another factor such as food availability, then although similarly sized mussels
were transplanted, those from Oregon may have been younger. Thus, differences in
growth may be the result of the difference in age rather than a true difference between
populations.
The suggestive difference in growth was not reflected in the physiology of these
organisms. Respiration and MDH activity results clearly showed no significant
