mussel bed creates habitat for other marine organisms. Thus, this species has strong
impact on community structure in the intertidal zone.
Because M. californianus is an ectothermic species, its body temperature is
dependant upon its environment (Helmuth 1999). Therefore, physiological processes
could be greatly affected by ambient temperatures. If enzymatic activities of animals are
measured at the same temperature, the organisms from colder temperatures will often
have higher activities and metabolism than their equivalents from warmer environments
(Hochachka and Somero, in press). Thus, the metabolic activities of the organisms at
their respective native habitats will be similar. Moving an organism from colder to
warmer waters may cause physiological processes to speed up until the animal has
acclimated to the new environment.
Because the only direct way to quantify metabolism is by difficult calorimetric
methods, indirect methods generally are used to measure metabolism (Schmidt-Nielsen
1997). The most used method to obtain metabolic rates is to determine oxygen
consumption. Quantifying activity of an ATP generating enzyme is another way to
measure metabolism. Metabolism has been correlated with growth (Frandsen and
Riisgard 1997), reproduction (Smaal et al. 1997), seasonal variation (Hatcher et al.
1997), age (Sukhotin and PÃ¶rtner 2001) and many other processes.
Despite the broad distribution of M. californianus, research has shown few
significant differences among populations of the mussel. Grant Pogson at University of
California, Santa Cruz has not found significant genetic differences among M.
californianus populations (Sanford pers. comm.). Levinton and Suchanek (1978) also
found minimal genetic variation in M. californianus along 3000km of the North
