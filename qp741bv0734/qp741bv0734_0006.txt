MATERIAL AND METHODS
Collection and Maintenance of Specimens
In February 2001, mussels (4.5-5.Scm in shell length) were collected from the
lower limit of wave-exposed mussel beds at Mal Paso Creek, California (36°33'N
121°56’W) and Fogarty Creek, Oregon (44°50’N 124°03’W). Mussels from each site
were transplanted by Sanford into 20 x 20 cm Vexar"M mesh cages in the low-intertidal
zone at two wave-exposed sites: Soberanes Point, California (36°27’N 121°56’W) and
Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, California (36°37.3N 121°54.3’W). Each of the six cages
contained 20 mussels from both sites of origin. A small notch was filed into the growing
lip of each mussel shell to allow the measurement of growth and to identify the source of
the mussels (Oregon=1 notch, California=2 notches). In May 2001, transplanted mussels
(n=2 per site of origin per cage) were collected at Soberanes Point and put into seawater
tanks at Hopkins Marine Station. During the same period, mussels were freshly collected
from Mal Paso Creek and Fogarty Creek (n-30 per site) and stored in the same seawater
tank.
I quantified respiration rates of and enzyme activities in the gills of these mussels.
For each mussel, length and growth (of the transplants) were measured. 1 then dissected
the mussel and removed both gills, which were washed in 0.22um filtered seawater
containing the antibiotics (Penicillin-G and Streptomyocin each at a concentration of
0.15mg/L). For each mussel, one gill was used to obtain a respiration rate and the other
was used to determine the activity level of malate dehydrogenase MDH, an enzyme of
the Krebs citric acid cycle and the anaerobic glycolytic pathway.
