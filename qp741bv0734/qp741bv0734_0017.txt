ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Thank you to George Somero, a fantastic advisor who was supportive of almost anything
1 wanted to try in the lab. Peter Field, where would I be without your help with the
biochemical assays and for letting me call you at home whenever I ran into a problem.
Thanks to Caren Braby who I asked a million questions and for helping me with all the
little things. The rest of the Somero lab thanks for helping me out whenever I got stuck
on something. I am most grateful to Eric Sanford without whom this project definitely
would not have happened. It’s a good thing you set up the whelk experiment in the field
otherwise, 1 couldn’t have done this project. Thank you for all the time you spent editing,
and re-editing, and re-editing and making my project what it is.
Thanks to my parents for all their encouragement to pursue research. Jonah, thanks for
everything.
