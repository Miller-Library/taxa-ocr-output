Soberanes Point and three cages at Hopkins Marine Life Refuge were sampled (n=30-40
mussels per cage). Using t-tests, I tested whether growth per 100 d differed between
mussels from Oregon and California.
Temperature Loggers
Temperature records were obtained from mid-intertidal data loggers (Optic
StowAway, Onset Computer Corp., Pocasset, MA) at Soberanes Point, Hopkins Marine
Life Ref√ºge, and Fogarty Creek. Data loggers were put in the field over three months
before the February transplantation and were collected in May after samples were taken. I
used the temperatures from two hours before to two hours after each high tide to calculate
the mean high tide temperature. These data were used to estimate the acclimatization
temperature of the mussels used in this study. In addition, data on temperatures while the
transplants were in the field were collected. Data were analyzed using a t-test to
determine if the sites had different temperatures.
RESULTS
Four treatment groups were compared: freshly collected from Oregon and
California, and field-acclimatized from Oregon and California (transplanted for 10 weeks
to Soberanes Point).
Respirometry
The respiration runs showed great variability among individuals within the same
treatment group (Fig. 2). Mussels in all treatments had similar respiration rates of
