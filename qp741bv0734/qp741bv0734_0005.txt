American West Coast. However, M. californianus is known for having variation within a
population. Although few growth studies have been done on M. californianus, the rate of
shell growth has been shown to vary with age, sex, temperature and food concentration
(Coe and Fox 1942, 1944; Fox and Coe 1943). Dehnel (1956) examined growth in the
field of mussels from different latitudes, and found significant variation with mussels at
his most southern site having the largest growth rate. Unfortunately, mussels at these sites
were from different tidal heights, which probably affected growth more than water
temperature. Pickens (1965) showed some temperature compensation for the heart rate of
M. californianus at colder temperatures. Mussels acclimated to new temperatures in six
weeks or less, but this was dependant on mussel size.
Additionally, morphological differences between populations have been
researched. Environmental conditions (e.g. wave exposure) affect shape and shell
thickness, and the thicker shelled mussels may grow slower than thinner ones (Fox and
Coe 1943; Coe and Fox 1944). Rao (1953) found an increasing proportion of shell weight
to soft tissue weight as latitude increased.
This study investigated whether differences in growth between populations of M.
californianus from Central Oregon and Central California occurred during the winter
period. This research also examined metabolic rates by comparing respiration and malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) activity between these two populations. Additionally, some
aspects of mussel morphology were evaluated.
