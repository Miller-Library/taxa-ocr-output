To prepare the measurements for data analysis, I first ensured that the MDH run
contained no electrical spikes for at least 15 sec. I calculated the enzyme activity from the
change in absorbance/min for 25 sec. To determine the activity of the enzyme the
following equation was used: (Aabs/min x volume of gill homogenate)/(s of NADH).
where s equals the extinction coefficient. To determine the activity in umol
OAAlmin/gram of tissue the activity was multiplied by 200 because 5mg of tissue were
put into the cuvette. I performed a single factor ANÖVA to test whether differences in
activity existed among the four groups. Respiration rates were compared to the MDH
activity using a regression analysis.
Morphological Measurements
Morphological measurements were also made to investigate variation between the
Oregon and California mussels. I measured the shell length, width and total thickness of
freshly collected mussels from Oregon and California (n=10 per population). I also
measured both wet and dry weights of the gills. Prior to weighing, wet gills were blotted
(see above), and dry weights were measured after gills had been dried at 70°C to a
constant weight (approximately 48 h). I performed analyses using t-tests and regression
analysis to determine if any differences between populations were significant.
Field Growth Measurements
The growth of transplanted mussels was quantified in late May in the field at both
Soberanes Point and Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. New shell added beyond the notch in
the growing lip of each mussel was measured (+0.01) using digital calipers. Six cages at
