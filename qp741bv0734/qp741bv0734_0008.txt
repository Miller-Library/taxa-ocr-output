incorporating the solubility of oxygen, the volume of the chamber and the weight of the
gill. I used the following equation to get the rate in umol O2/sec/gram of gill tissue: (the
volume of the chamber) x (slope/100) x (solubility of oxygen at 15°C, latm, 34%00
salinity of seawater). I performed a single factor Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA) to
determine whether oxygen consumption differed among the four groups.
MDH Biochemical Assay
MDH activity was quantified in the other gill from each mussel used in
respiration, and from three or four more mussels per treatment (n=10 total per treatment)
The gill was weighed and then homogenized (Duall, Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ) on
ice by hand and diluted 5x in 200mM imidazole buffer, pH=7.0. I then transferred this
solution into a 2mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuged it at 5°C and 1400Orpm for five min,
1 mixed 50mL of 200mM imidazole buffer (pH=7.0) in an Erhlenmeyer flask with
0.0054g of NADH (final concentration of O.15mM) and 0.0014g of oxaloacetate (OAA)
(final concentration of O.2mM). This solution was kept on ice and in the dark whenever
possible to minimize degradation of NÄDH. A spectrophotometer (UV-1601, Shimadzu
Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD) with the Kinetics computer program was
used to read the activity of the enzyme. The spectrophotometer was zeroed using the
buffer before assays were started. 3mL cuvettes with 2mL of the cocktail were
equilibrated in a 15°C water bath. Using a 25uL Lang-Levy pipette, I transferred an
aliquot of the sample to one of the pre-equilibrated cuvettes in the spectrophotometer,
stirred the solution vigorously for five seconds, and then recorded the activity for 30 sec
(n=5 replicates per gill).
