Field Growth Measurements
At both sites, the mussels from Oregon grew faster than those from California
(Fig. 7), although differences fell just short of statistical significance. At Hopkins Marine
Life Ref체ge, the Oregon average growth was 1.72mm/100 d while for California mussels
it was 0.952mm/100 d (t==-0.196, df=4, p=0.061). Similarly, at Soberanes Point, Oregon
mussels tended to grow faster than those from California (0.52mm/100 d vs. 0.31mm/100
d, respectively) although growth was much lower than that at Hopkins, and the difference
was only marginally significant (t,=-1.739, df-10, p-0.056).
Temperature Loggers
Water temperatures during the 10 weeks prior to the February transplantation of
the mussels were 2.5째C cooler at Fogarty Creek than at Soberanes Point (Fig. 8, t,-30.04,
df-292, p=2.64E-91). In contrast, water temperatures during the 10 weeks prior to
collection of fresh mussels in early May were only 0.7째C cooler at Fogarty Creek (Fig. 9.
ts=1.969, df=254, p=4.94E-04). Mussels transplanted to Soberanes Point experienced
water temperatures 2째C cooler than those at Hopkins Marine Life Refuge during the 10
weeks of growth (Fig. 9, t,=15.83, df=254, p=9.48E-40).
DISCUSSION
This research showed that during the winter, growth of Oregon and California M.
californianus was very slow. The difference in mussel growth rate was nearly significant
between the populations (p=0.05-0.06), but the lack of significance in rates may be due to
small sample sizes and low resolution from little growth. In comparison with a similar
