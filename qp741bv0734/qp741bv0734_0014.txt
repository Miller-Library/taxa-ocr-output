differences between Oregon and California mussels during winter (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).
However, because the growth was minimal, the differences in metabolic rates may have
been muted and difficult to detect with relatively small sample sizes. Respiration and
MDH activity showed no correlation (Fig. 4). This may be because MDH plays a role in
both aerobic and anaerobic ATP generation whereas oxygen consumption only reflects
aerobic metabolism. In addition, it is possible that respiration and MDH activity may not
be linked with growth in M. californianus.
Despite the similarities in physiology, there were some interesting morphological
differences. The Oregon gills were much lighter in pigmentation than the California gills
(Fig. 6), perhaps due to an environmental factor (e.g. diet) or perhaps indicating intrinsic
differences between the populations. In addition, for similarly-sized mussels, the Oregon
gill was significantly smaller than the California gill. This, too, could reflect greater
water-column food concentration in Oregon (such that the gill needs less surface area), or
it may be an intrinsic difference between the populations.
The larval biology of M. californianus suggests minimal variation between
populations along a latitudinal gradient. The pelagic larval stage of the M. californianus
veliger lasts about nine days (Strathmann 1987). Because of the short pelagic larval stage,
it seems unlikely that the larvae would be able to travel significant distances along the
Northern American West Coast. Thus, populations of M. californianus along the West
Coast could have reduced gene flow, and differences in populations especially because of
adaptations to a particular environment seem possible.
One factor this research did not address was possible differences in air
temperature and heat stress between sites. The mussels were normally exposed for about
