approximately 0.0012 +0.0001 umol O2/sec/gram of tissue. There were no significant
differences between the Oregon and California mussels, either freshly collected or field
acclimated (Table la, ANOVA, p-O. 413).
MDH Biochemical Assay
Similar to the respiration results, the MDH activity showed no significant
differences among the treatment groups (Table 1b, ANÖVA, p-O. 831). There was
considerable variability among individuals, but replicates for each individual were very
similar. The mean activity for all treatments were very similar at 0.143+ 0.005 umol
OAA/min/gram of tissue (Fig. 3). There was no correlation between respiration rates and
MDH activity levels (Fig. 4, p-0.194, R“=0.075).
Morphological Measurements
The thickness (t,=-0.828, df=18, p=0. 419), length (t,=-0.263, df-18, p-0. 796),
and width (t,=1.23, df=18, p=0. 235) of the shell were not significantly different between
Oregon and California mussels. However, despite the similar size of mussels, the gill dry
weight of Oregon mussels was 16.9% less than that of California mussels (0.0190g vs.
0.0229g, respectively; t,=2.66, df=18, p=0. 016). Gill wet weight was significantly
correlated with gill dry weight (Fig. 5, p=1.68E-06, R“=0.729). In addition, I noticed that
the Oregon mussels had pale gills while the California mussels' gills were bright and rich
in color (Fig. 6).
