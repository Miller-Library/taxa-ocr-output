Respirometry
Before the respiration trial, I put the gill in a 100mL beaker with filtered seawater
and antibiotics and placed it in a 15°C water bath. The oxygen microelectrode (model
MI-730, oxygen meter model ÖM-4, Microelectrodes, Inc., Bedford, NH) was zeroed by
submersing it in an oxygen-free solution of O.OIM NaB saturated with NaS crystals. The
electrode was then calibrated to full oxygen saturation in the solution of filtered seawater
and antibiotics that was gently bubbled with an air pump.
Respiration was measured in a water-jacketed 14.4mL chamber (Fig. 1). The
microelectrode entered the chamber through a threaded hole in the top. The water-jacket
surrounding the respiration chamber was connected to a water bath set to 15°C and the
whole device sat upon a stir plate. The gill was sandwiched between two layers of nylon
mesh and placed on a perforated plastic platform over a magnetic stir bar. I carefully
sealed the chamber and removed all air bubbles before beginning the trial. Using the
Powerlab unit (8sP ADInstruments, Mountain View, CA) and the Powerlab Chart
Program, I measured the decline of oxygen saturation for 30 min, removed the gill, and
ran a control for another 10 min. Äfter the run, I weighed the gill by blotting both sides
with a Kimwipe'" so that respiration rate could be normalized by the mass of the gill
tissue. 1 determined gill respiration rates in at least six mussels from each treatment (n-6-
7 per treatment).
1 calculated respiration rates from the slope of the decline in oxygen for 20 min
after an initial 10 min period. Because the slope used was after the first 10 min, control
runs were not subtracted out since they usually were made during the initial 10 min of the
run when there was often noise in the reading. This slope was normalized by
