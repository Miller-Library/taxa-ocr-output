INTRODUCTION
Although intertidal and subtidal systems have been studied extensively, very little
is known regarding latitudinal variation in marine populations. Considerable research has
found physiological and biochemical variation in organisms across their geographic range
(Walsh and Somero 1981, Hochachka and Somero, in press), but little is known about
how these responses to local temperature affect populations and communities. In addition
to differences caused by the latitudinal temperature gradient, populations may vary
genetically. The life histories of most marine species include planktonic stages, and thus
high gene flow among populations is expected. However, current studies suggest that
larval retention and genetic differentiation may be more common than previously thought
(Warner et al. 2000).
Recent work has found significant differences in growth between mussels from
populations of Mytilus californianus. During the summer of 2000, Eric Sanford
transplanted groups of mussels from Central Oregon and Central California to both
Oregon and California. The results showed that Oregon mussels grew faster than those
from California at all sites independent of location. In this study, I investigated whether
differences between populations were the result of acclimation or intrinsic effects.
The California mussel, M. californianus, is a common marine invertebrate in the
rocky mid-intertidal zone (Gosling 1992). Its distribution spans the West Coast of North
America from Alaska to Baja California, and often can dominate very wave exposed
areas (Ricketts et al. 1985). M. californianus has been shown to limit biodiversity of
sessile marine invertebrates through competition for space (Paine 1966). However, the
