ABSTRACT: Mytilus californianus dominates the rocky mid-intertidal zone along much
of the West Coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California. Thus, it has
important effects on community structure. Previous work has failed to identify genetic
differences among populations along this latitudinal gradient. However, some differences
in morphology have been described. A preliminary study showed that mussels from
Central Oregon grew significantly faster than those from Central California when
transplanted to sites in either state. My study investigated physiological differences in
populations of M. californianus from Oregon and California. In February, mussels were
transplanted to California from Oregon and California. In May, additional mussels were
freshly collected from the original populations. Gill respiration rates and malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) activity were examined to compare metabolic rates of individuals
in these populations, and determine if differences were intrinsic or transitory effects of
acclimation.
No significant differences were found in respiration rates or MDH activity
between the two populations of mussels, both for field acclimated and freshly collected
groups. Although overall field growth was low, there was suggestive but inconclusive
evidence that transplanted mussels from Oregon grew significantly more than California
mussels during the February to May period. These results do not rule out either an
acclimation effect or intrinsic differences between these populations. Because the Oregon
waters were slightly colder (by 2.5Â°C) during the ten weeks prior to the transplantation.
acclimation of the Oregon mussels may explain the growth difference. Alternatively.
there could be intrinsic differences in growth potential between the two populations. In
either case, differences in respiration rates and MDH activity were either too small to be
