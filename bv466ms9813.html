NTRODUCTICN
Pentidotheastenops (Bencdict 1898) is an isopod (Grustacea) found
exclusively in the lower intertidal (+1.0 --2.0 ft. tide level and
below), or as more precisely expressed by Doty (1946) between LHLW, the
highest level exposed once a day and LLLW, a level rarely exposed. It
is reported by Hatch (1947) to be found from Coos Bay, Oregon to
Monterey Bay, Calif, Since its color range (Saccardo's olive green to
black according to Ridgway's Color Standard) matches that of its plant
hosts, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Egregia : Exact'>Egregia</span> and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Laminaria : Exact'>Laminaria,</span> the animals are not easily seen in the
field.
Very little is known about this animal beyond the standard anatom-
ical description (Menzis, 1950). An investigation of its habitat and
its relatidship to the plant hosts together with a study of bchavior
atterns of this crustacean was the object of this present study.

MET
IELD WORK
In order to find the natural habitats and to plot the distri-
bution of P. stenops on the Monterey Peninsula, sixteen areas were
chosen because of their diversity between the Coast Guard Breakwater.
at the western end of Monterey Harbor and Mission Point, at the western
end of Carmel Beach which is the midpoint of Carmel Bay, a coastline of
7-8 miles (fig. 1). In this area there are very rough (Pescadero Pt.)
to calm (Stillwater Cove) situations, and intermediate locations (table
2). Because of their local diversity, three of these areas (2,6.7)
were divided in half giving a total of nineteen stations. Each station
was characterized concerning temperature, oxygen, degree of exposure.
algal growth and selected physical parameters (table 2). Population
densities were scored (table 1) on Egregia and Laminaria which were
found to be the favored host plants. Since conditions varied from area
to area as to algal growth and physical characteristics these designations
turned out to be very flexible and very few arcas actually fit into
one category in all respects. Each arca was sampled at least three
times and the mean of the values obtained is found in table 2.

OXYGEN CONCENTRATION
Oxygen concentrations were determined by taking samples in 60nl
glass stoppered bottles and performing a standard Winkler oxygen anal-
ysis in the lab.
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between oxygen concentration and ab-
undance in the areas sampled. There is greater than a 99.9% cor-
relation between oxygen concentration and number of specimens found
Ecology of P. sten
(Kendle-Tau Rank-Order correlation test). Ideally, the graph should
start in the lower left-hand corner (high temp., low oxygen conc., low
abundance) and proceed in a somewhat linear fashion to the upper right-
hand corner (low temp., high oxygen conc., high abundance), however
fluctuations occur because of the varying conditions of the areas
sampled in this study.

TEMPERATURE
Temperature was recorded on a standard centigrade thermometer.
All temperatures were taken at between the -1.0 and -2.0 ft. tidal
levels during the early morning hours.
A high degree of correlation also exists between temperature and
relative abundance (fig. 3). The actual plot, found by plotting all
the points separately, is found in the upper right-hand corner while
the larger graph relates the mean teperatures over selected ranges to
give a better visual representation of the strong correlation which
exsists. Temperature seems definitely to be a factor in determining
the distribution of the isopod.

The categories are somewhat arbitrary but they do serve their purpose in

Again, a strong correlation exists between degree of exposure and

preferred.

Fig, 5 sums up the field work by relating all the factors con-

note the number of areas with the designated degree of esposure. It
should be noted that a population of P. stenops was never found in calm
areas where the highest mean temperatures and lowest mean oxygen levels
also were recorded. The rough areas, characterized by low temperatures
and high oxygen concentrations, seem to be the preferred areas for the
existence of larger populations of the isopod. The abundance level
rops off as the areas get very rough which must besolclyto the heavy
wave action as the oxygen concentrations and temperatures are comparable
to those recorded inthe rough areas.
Ecology of P. stenops
LAB WORK
From the field data it was suspected that oxygen, temperature and
degree of exposure were possible limiting factors for the distribution
of P. stenogs. Lab experiments were undertaken to confirm these sus¬
picions.


OXIGEN TULERANCE
An oxygen tolerance test was run in which one animal was placed
in a 500ml Erlenmeyer flask containing sea water at a recorded temperature
and oxygen level. An oxygen probe connected with a rubber plug was used
to stopper the flask. The animals were confined in a screen cage and
as
stirring flea was placed on the bottom of the flask. The temperature
was ke
puconstant by placing the flask in a water bath. Readings were
taken at irregular intervals.
The oxygen graph (fig. 6) shows similar curves for all three size
sifications of P. stenops. T
clas
he interesting point is that the animals
were still living in oxygen concentrations as low as i-2
pm. During
the night in the field it is known that actual oxygen levels approach
such low values as the algae do not photosynthsize during the dark
hours. It would be of adaptive significance to P. stenops to be able to
exist under such conditions. However, it was also noticed that the
isopods become weakened when the oxygen concentration level fell to
below 3-4 ppm as they gripped their soreen cages loosely and sometimes
let go of the wire mesh completely. Atsuch low oxygen levels they
open¬
ed their uropods and weakly beat their pleopods, their respiratory mech-
anisms.
Ecology of P. stenop
It was concluded that oxygen concentrations of 3-4 ppm resulted in
a weakened state of the isopod, probably reducing its ability to hold on
to the algae in the heavy surf zone.
TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE
A standard LT50 temperature tolerance test was performed to deter-
mine sensitivity of P. stenops to temperature variations. Sixteen iso-
pods were placed in each of four disposable plastic tubs which were
placed in four different temperature environments (fig. 73), A measured
amount of E
gregia was placed in each tub and the four tubs were oxygenated
every four hours. Readings were taken at irregular intervals.
The isopods seem to be extremely sensi¬
tive to slight variations in
temporature. At 15 C their LT50 was 26 hours, a startling result when
one considers that temperatures along the coast exceed this at dif-
ferent times of the year. Temperature could definitely be a limiting
factor as P. stenops is found to occur predominantly in the rough in-
tertidal zones where a constant stirring up of the water insures a rel-
atively low temperature,where a calm area remains in a rather stagnant
tate and the water is allowed to warm up.
EXPOSURE
A rough vs smooth water experiment was performed on thirty isopods
to determine their preference to water motion and the periodic impact of
waves. A wave machine (fig.8) was constructed which created a water dis¬
turbance every 56 seconds. The isopods were evenly distributed according
to size and sex along three Egregia rachises, which were immersed in a
confined measured area in a large saltwater pool. T
The area was divided
Ecology of P. stenops
equally in half by a chalk line on the bottom of the pool; one side
directly oxposed to the periodic wave shock and the other relatively
calm.
The isopods showed no preference for either the rough or calm
areas indicating that perhaps water motion is not a deternining factor
but the conditions that result from such wave action are advantageous
to the animals' survival.
Y" VS CLEAN WATER
DRI
At the termination of the wave impact experiment the Egregia
rachises in the rough area of the tank were noticably cleaner than the
rachises in the calm area. It was speculated that perhaps the isopods
require a relatively clean environment in which to thrivel A LT50
test to determine survival rates in clean vs "dirty" water (fig. 7) was
run. Two disposable plastic tubs were filled with equal amounts of sea
water and a measured amount of Egregia was placed in each. A one mil-
limeter layer of "dirt", consisting of fecal material of P. stenops and
decayed Egregia recovered from the bottom of an aquarium, was placed on
the bottom of the
Irty tub. Both tubs were placed in a constant temp-
erature (12.8•0) water bath. No further water was allowed to enter
either tank. Observations were taken at irregular intervals. Oxygen
readings were taken at the LT50 time in the dirty tub and at the termin-
ation of the experiment in the clean tank.
Survival rates under oxygen deprivation conditions were markedly
decreased in the dirty water. The final oxygen reading in the dirty water
(5.6ppm) was much higher than those concentrations (1-2 ppm) P. stenops
Ecology of P. stenops
was previously found to survive in. In an even higher concentration
the isopods showed signs of weakening. All isopods in the clean tub
were still living at the termination of the experiment, 14 hours after
the LT50 time of the dirty water. The oxygen level recorded in the
water (3.2 ppm) was lower than that in the dirty tub. This implies that
there is some other factor involved, other than oxygen deprivation, af-
fecting a lower survival rate in the dirty water.
SSICATION
Another probable factor limiting <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>P. stenor</span>
s to the lower inter-
tidal zone is perhaps its rate of dessication. A standard LT50 des-
sication tolerance test (fig. 7 ) was run on 12 animals. They were
placed in a dry glass bowl and kept under constent observation as a
short LT50 time was expected. The animals were kept separated, using a
metal probe, to reduce clumping, a common method utilized by terrest:
rial
isopods to reduce water loss.
The short LT50 time (1.5 hours) implies that it would not be ad-
vantageous to P. stenops to be left outof the water, exposed to the air.
for long periods of time, such as during a low tide. This could defin¬
itely be a factor in restricting the animal to the lowest tidal level.
ALGAE GROUTH AND FOOD CHOICE
Feeding marks were observed on both L
inaria and Egregia, in the
field and in the lab, and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nereocystis : Exact'>Nereocystis</span> in the lab. Gut analysies were
performed on 20 P. stenops collected from various areas.

Egregia, the various epiphytes that grow upon it and Laminaria
seem to be the most common algae used for food by P. stenops. They ap¬
parently will eat

tis and assorted Red algae
(table

DED
PERFORMANCE
A performance test relative to feeding and temperature was run
to assegs the limiting factors determining the distributions of P.
stenops. It had been noticed in lab kept animals that as conditions
deteriorated dueto oxygen depletion, a rise in temperature and a change
han ono
of food, animals lost their ability totheir host plants. It was reasoned
that a test of their strength to hang on would be indicative of their
physical condition.
A seawater fire hydrant was utilized in order to simulate a strong
current in the following way: A rachis of Egregia was placed in an
aluminum gutter (fig.12), one end of which received an onrush of seawater
from the spout of the hydrant. Twelve animals were grown on each of
three different substrates, one at a different temperature (fig.8) for
48 - 72 hours before testing. It was felt that food and temperature
variances were most convenient to test. It would have been proper to
test also oxygen levels but this presented too many complications,
All twelve anpimals grown under cach condition were placed on the
Ecology of P. stenops
10
rachis at one time. An initial problem arose during the first runs in
that it became clear that the isopods showed erratic responses to their
new conditions and some repeatedly fell off. A proceedure was developed
whereby after the twolvo were placed on the rachis, the water was turned
on so that only a slight current was created. Those that did not hang
on were removed. If such animals numbered not more than half (6) then
the run was continued and the water was turned on full. The flow was
kept up until half the isopods were swept away. The time was recorded
from the point of the first rush of water when turned on full to the time
when the last isopod was swept off. The numbers in the columns of fig.
8 refer to the numberof animals left after the initial wash,
The results seem to indicate that indeed food and temperature do
affect the isopod's physical well-being as sharp drops occur in the
time able to hang on as tho diet and temperature were varied from the
normal. This is more evidence that both food (algae) and temperature are
limiting factors in the distribution of P. stenops.

DISCUSSION
The results of the lab work correlate quite well with observations
and recordings made in the field. It is obvious that not one single
factor is resposible for P. stenops occuring in abundance where they do
but rather it is a combination of most of the factors considered that
determines their presence in a given area. It has been shown that it is
not the actual movement of water in a rough area that is beneficial for
the success of a population of P. stonops, but the oxygen levels, temp-
erature and cleanliness of water resulting from the effects of the heavy.
Ecology of P. stenops
11
periodic water motion. The dgree to which P
P. stenops can survive in a
heavy surf zone can be noted in that its abundance diminishes as the area
becomes very rough.
That
stenons occurs only at the lowest intertidal levels explains
why it is susceptible to dessication. Even though Egregia, its major
host and food source, occurs up to the ti.0 ft. tidal level, P. stenops
can be observed only from approximately the-O.5 ft. level and on down.
From the data collected an "ideal" area for the maintenance of
a sizable population of I
stenons can be described. It is the following:
A generally rough area with a temperature range between 10' and 15°G.
he oxygen concentration of the water must be above 8.00 ppm during the
day and the water should be relatively clean (note: area 6b, sewer out-
fall). Both Egregia and I
inaria should be plentiful.

NATURAL HISTORY NOTE
Some interesting behavior patterns in the field were noted dur-
ing sampling excursions and they will be considered here.
ORIENTATION
The first concerns the particular orientation of P, stenops on
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Egregia : PartialExact'>Egregia stipes.</span> No matter which way the current is flowing in the
ocean there is always a flow of water outward from the holdfast to the
end of the rachis on Egregia. It was observed that most of the stenops
oriented themselves so that they were facing in the direction of. i.e..
antennae towards,the apex-ofthe stipe. A current tube (fig. 10) was
constructed to test the significance of theis observation and the re¬
sults (fig. 7 ) show that a significant number of isopods prefer this
orientation.
Animals were placed both facing towards and away from the current.
four at a time, on a rachis of Egregia and exposed for two hours. From
the data (fig. 7 ) it is seen that P, stenops do prefer to face away
from the current a significant amount of the time and this result agrees
with the field observations.
It was also noted that when facing towards the apex of the rachis
the isopod assumes a more hydrodynamically favorable position as com-
pared with facing the current head on. The telson is pressed down upon
the surface of the rachis in such a way as to allow the water to pass
over and around the body with very little lifting and pulling of the
animal. This would appear to be extremely advantagcous to P. stenops
for its survival in the wave swept areas in which it is most commomly

found.
PHCTOTROPY
P. stenops showed obvious photonegativism in the field as they were
predominantly foundon the underside of Egregia rachises and when held
exposed to the sun would scurry back around to the shady side. A light
vs dark experiment was devised (fig.11) to test the significance of
this behavior. A disposable plastic tub was covered with black paper

and holes were punched at either end. A rachis of)

a, lipped of
its blades in the middle three-quarters of length, was placed longi-
tudinally in the box and fixed in position by running the two ends
through the two holes. The box was clamped, submerged, in an aquarium.
open to the window of the aquarium. Two one-hundred watt bulbs were
placed facing the open side and an isopod was placed either facing the
open lighted side or on the dark side, always facing up. The lights
vere left on for two hours per trial.
The results of this experiment (fig. 7 ) show conclusively that
sienops is photonegative which explains the field finding of the
predominance of isopods on the underside of
ia rachises.
P
stenops found on Laminaria will often times have a paraeopod
hooked on another leaf and have pulled it over itself to cover its
body in a kind of sandwich of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Laminaria : PartialExact'>Laminaria blades.</span> This curious be-
havior can also be explained by their photonegativism,
ADAPTION TO HOST
A direct correlation between size of isopod and size of rachis or
blade of algae was found through observations made in the field. It
Ecology of P. stenops
14
seems that P. stenops can not puncture the algae from the top with
their hook-like, semi-chelate legs but rather must hook them around
the opposite side of the rachis or blade where it can and does punc¬
ture the alga. This phenomenoowas demonstrated by placing an isopod
on a wide blade of-Laminaria that it could not reach around. It was
very easy to push off, not being attached to the alga by any means.
In the field one often finds an isopod on a blade too wide for it
to stretch both legs around. It will, in such instances, be to one
side so that it can at least loop the paraeopods of one side of its
body around to secure itself. This behavior is further evidenced by
baby <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Stenops : Exact'>Stenops</span> which are found exclusively on the basal portion of the
lateral blades of Egregia (Robert G. Sellers - unpublished work),
These tiny blades are perfect for the small stenops to hang onto
SWIMIING
P. Stenops is a rather poor swimmer for an animal which spends
most of its life underwater. The only function that swimming seems to
serve is that of finding something to grab onto. aStenops were never
seen swimming in the field. Even when observed underwater during high
tides the animals were always seen clutching to either Egregia or
Laminaria. This observation was further evidenced in the lab. When
P. Stenops were placed in an empty dish thoy would engage in short
swimming bursts in all directions, presumably searching for something
to grab on to. Any material that was introduced int the dish, includ-
ing: metal forceps, other stenops, fingers, glass slides and wire mesh
0
Ecology of P. stenops
15
became a temporary home for the isopods as they would immediately grasp
onto such materials after having run into it during the course of one
of their short swimming bursts. I am under the impression that stenops
utilizes its limited ability to swim only under extreme circumstances
such as when it becomes dislodged from its algal host,
COLOR VARLATION
Color variation in P. Stenops is another highly adaptive character-
istic it possesses. The current two species of Egragia found in the
gata and E. menzisii, range in color from a light
area studied, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. laevis
olive</span> green to almost a black, including all variations of green and
brown. As was mentioned in the introduction, the stenops observed in
the study area were found to possess color variations in the exact same
range. This enables them to utilize camouflage as a defense mechanism
against predators (and collectors I may note).
GENERAL
The general activity of P. stenops in the field consists of feeding
(algae browsing) and copulation. As in other Idotheas the male grasps
onto the back of a non-brooding female and waits until she molts,
which time copulation occurs. The male and female then separate, and,
to what extent they could be observed, they do not encounter each other
again until the female delivers her young and becomes, once again, non-
brooding. Males and females in the field were found to occur in equal
numbers.
Although it appears that many parameters of the lifestyle of the
marine isopod P. stenops have been investigated here, a great deal more
remains to be investigated into this crustacean.

SORMARY
Populations of P. stenops were observed and sampled along selected
treas on the Central California coast. Ecological factors affecting
their population distribution as well as characteristic behavior pat-
ns were noted. Lab experiments were performed to test the signi-
ficance of such observations on the general well-being of the isopod.
