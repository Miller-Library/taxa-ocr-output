Calcium Spikes in Metridium
in MgCl, solution. (Figure 11 and Figure 12)
Cobaltous chloride in sea water
The effect of 10 mM CoCl, is found to be very similar
to calcium-free artificial sea water, as seen in Figure 13, CoCl
is seen to work much quicker than either Mgol, or calcium-free
mediums and is seen to have less blocking effect to muscle conÂ¬
tractions illicited by high voltage stimuli (Figurellvs.12).
Stimulus site decrement is more rapid with CoCl, than any other
solution tested. (Figure 15)
Discussion
In concentrations of 0.1 mg/1 Tetrodotoxin completely
inhibits conductance in frog sciatic nerves within ten minutes
after application (Kao and Fuhrman, 1967). Tetrodotoxin has high
rates of diffusion in frog neurons, with or without myelin
sheath, and the preparation used here is quite thin with a high
surface to volume ratio (Kao and Fuhrman, 1963, 1967). Thus it
is reasonable to conclude that Tetrodotoxin is reaching the
neurons but is having no effect.
D. M. Ross has shown that preparations in sodium-free sea
water show no change in response to electrical stimuli (Ross,
1960). Thus it is reasonable to conclude that sodium is not the
spike ion, since neither the absence of sodium nor the presence
of an inhibitor of its conduction affects the system.
It has been shown here that the absence of calcium ions or
