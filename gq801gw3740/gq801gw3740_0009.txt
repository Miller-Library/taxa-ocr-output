Calcium Spikes in Metridium
ion, it is possible that calcium-free sea water with magnesium
ion present inhibits vessicle release. Second, calcium-free
sea water or the presence of other divalent cations may in¬
hibit muscle end plate potentials, rather than the nerve net.
Considerable evidence has been presented here to contradict this
idea, but the possibility is still present.
In order that these findings be made conclusive, it will
be necessary to record electrically from the nerve net during
stimulation, a test which has been found difficult. The evidence
given here is clear in itself and it is reasonable to believe
that calcium is the spike ion in the anemone nervous system.
Summary
1. There are two distinct types of stimulus site: one
which responds to two pulses at low voltage, termed ideal, and
the other which requires more pulses at higher voltage, termed
non-ideal.
2. Stimulation at any site decrements the ability of the
site to respond to further stimulation.
3. Nerve net initiated contractions may be differentiated
from electrically initiated contractions.
4. Tetrodotoxin has no effect on the responses of Metridium
senile to electrical stimulation.
5. Calcium-free sea water extinguishes response to elec¬
trical stimulation.
