Calcium Spikes in Metridium
solutions were changed every four hours. At the end of the test
period, each preparation was placed on the apparatus in fresh
test solution and a series of stimuli were applied, similar to the
series used initially. Thus, results reported refer to the
differences between the initial and final recordings relative
to the differences in the controls.
est solutions
The five solutions used were prepared as follows. Sea
water was used from the running sea water system. Its temper-
ature ranged from 12-15°0. Tetrodotoxin in.53M Nacl in dis¬
tilled water at 100 mg/ml was added to 100 ml of sea water.
Artificial sea water was prepared using formula M. B. L. No.
given in the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory Manual
(Cavanaugh, 1956). Calcium-free artificial sea water was pre-
pared by formula number 6, that of Moore, given in the same
reference. Cobaltous chloride solution was prepared by
adding isotonic Cocly to sea water in the same final concen¬
tration as Caclo, 10 mM.
Electrical recording
Attempts were made to record nerve and muscle potentials
from the preparation by means of a glass suction electrode of
inner diameter 150u. A Tektronix type 122 preamplifier and
Tektronix type 502 scope were used for display. Recordings
were seen that resembled those reported by Robson and Joseph-
son (1968), but these were rare and are not further reported.
