potency in less than thirty minutes, whether or not the elecÂ¬
trodes are physically removed, as long as no electrical stimuli
are used.
Distinguishing-nerve net initiated contractions from electrically
initiated contractions.
The nerve net was considered deactivated after four hours
in MgClo may also slightly impair muscle ability while CoCl
in relatively small concentrations quickly deadened nervous
response but did not seem to impair the muscle's ability to
contract.
A comparison of differences in response to electrical
stimuli between preparations in sea water and preparations in
Cocl or MgCl is shown in Table I. Note that in all cases
a nerve net initiated contraction requires two pulses or more,
while muscle may be stimulated by one pulse.
