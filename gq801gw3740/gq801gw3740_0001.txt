Calcium Spikes in Metridium
Introduction
In preliminary experiments designed to observe isometric
contractions in the sea anemone Metridium senile it was noted
that Tetrodotoxin in low or high concentrations (0.1 mg/1 and
10 mg/1) had no effects on responses to electrical stimuli.
Tetrodotoxin has the specific effect of holding closed the sodium
gate in other nervous systems and thus blocking conduction
(Kao and Fuhrman, 1967; Takata, Moore, Kao, and Fuhrman, 1965).
Following this observation experiments were undertaken
to show that Na was not the ion used in depolarizing the axon
by influx. The ion responsible for depolarization is usually
termed the spike ion. Noting the work of D. M. Ross (1969)
it was hypothesized that calcium might be used instead, since
Ross shows that when calcium is removed from artificial sea
water the anemone no longer responds. It is concluded that the
evidence indicates that calcium is the spike ion in Metridium
senile.
Materials and Methods
Apparatus
Mechanical recordings were made with a counterbalanced
lever system (Robson and Josephson, 1969), modified in that
the transducer used was a Grass model FTOB force transducer.
Thus the contractions were measured isometrically, and were
