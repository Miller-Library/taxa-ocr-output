Calcium Spikes in Metridium
The last preparation, held in increasing concentrations
over time, is shown in Figure 6 and is representative of all of
the mesentaries that were tested. In all cases the preparation
in Tetrodotoxin solution responded better than its control at any
point in the test period. Tetrodotoxin was found to have no
effect on responses to stimuli and no effect on specific site
decrement.
Artificial sea water, M. B..L. No. 1
Artificial sea water was used as a control for tests
in calcium-free artificial sea water. This formula does not
have the full complement of ions found in real sea water and perÂ¬
haps for this reason tends to increase the rate of decay of the
preparation as a whole, as seen in Figure 10. This overall
decay was barely noticeable in thirty minutes but was apparent
after four hours. The preparation decays uniformly in that
each site is effected in the same way, giving smaller responses
and showing heightened rates of stimulus site decrement.
Calcium-free artificial sea water
Within ten minutes after application the nervous
response is extinguished. The preparation relaxes continually,
and immediately after application the rate of stimulus site
decrement increases markedly. After twelve hours of application
muscle responses to 100v. stimuli are still present, but are
slower and of less magnitude than produced by a mesentary in
