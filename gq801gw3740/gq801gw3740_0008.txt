Calcium Spikes in Metridium
the presence of any of several other divalent cations extinguishes
nervous activity. These observations agree with those of Ross.
He further notes that if both calcium and magnesium ions are
removed from sea water the preparation's activity and responses
to stimulation are heightened (Ross, 1960). This particular
experiment was only carried out for thirty minutes, which in the
absence of magnesium ions (which Ross showed to be critical)
may not be long enough to deplete calcium ion reserves around the
neuron. It is thus theorized that the spike ion is calcium and
that magnesium ion, in competing with calcium controls the activity
of the nerve net.
In MgClo or calcium-free sea water the ability of muscles
to contract is impaired and eventually extinguished. This effect
is found to be much less with CoCl. It is theorized that cobalt
ion blocks nervous conduction by diffusing through interstitial
fluid and competing with calcium ion influx around the neuron
in the same manner as magnesium ion. But because of its larger size
cobalt ion is unable to diffuse into the muscle end plate to
block the calcium ion output there, or does so at a much slower
rate. A single experiment using manganous chloride showed its
effects on electrically initiated muscle contractions to be less
than magnesium ion but greater than cobalt ion.
These results cannot be regarded as conclusive because of
difficulties in two main areas. First, kWestfall has shown that
the synapses in Gonionemus contain dense core vessicles similar
to those in the vas deferens of the rat (Westfall, 1970). Since
release of these vessicles by exocytosis is catalyzed by calcium
