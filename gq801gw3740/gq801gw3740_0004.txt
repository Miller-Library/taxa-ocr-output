Ideal versus non-ideal sites
1. There are two distinct types of stimulus site, and
some gradation in between these. The first, termed ideal, is
is characterized by giving full responses to two pulses of
10 msec duration, 0.2 sec apart at 5 volts. Response immediately
follows the second pulse, as shown in Figure 1.
2. At the second type, termed a non-ideal site, more
pulses in a series, or higher voltage is required to illicit
a similar responseto an ideal site, as shown in Figure 2.
3. These sites are not automatically apparent and are
found by trial and error.
Stimulus site decrement
1. Stimulation at any site decrements the ability of the site
to respond to further stimulation, as shown in Figure 3
2. The rate of decrement at an ideal site is slower than
that at a non-ideal site. (Figure 4 ys. 3)
3. The rate of decrement depends on the condition of the
preparation, since by approximately sixty hours after dissection
the preparation fails to respond and necrosis is evident.
4. The more non-ideal the site is, the faster it decreÂ¬
ments. Also, the larger or longer the stimulus is used, the
faster decrementation occurs. (Figure 5)
5. Any site once decremented will return to its original
