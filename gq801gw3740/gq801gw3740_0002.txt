Calcium Spikes in Metridium
recorded on a Grass model 5 polygraph. Temperature was held
to the range between 12-16°0.
Stimulus
The stimulus electrode consisted of two platinum wires,
sixteen guage, insulated to lmm from the tip, placed 2mm apart.
Electrical pulses were obtained from a Grass model S6 stimulator,
through a Grass model S.I.U. 4678 stimulus isolation unit.
Voltages listed on figures are output across the electrode tips.
Preparation of animal
Metridium senile with average diameter of 5 cm were collected
from a depth of 6 meters on Wharf Number 2 of Monterey Harbor.
Monterey, California. In all cases the animals were maintained
for one week in aquariums with fresh running sea water before
dissection. Preparations were obtained by the method of Batham.
Pantin, and Robson (1960), and allowed to equilibrate for eight
hours.
For each test run the mesentary was removed from running
sea water and placed directly onto the apparatus. The prepara¬
tion was then stimulated and responses recorded until a series
of five similar responses were evidently typical of that mesen¬
tary.
The mesentary was then removed from apparatus and placed
in the test solution. A control placed in fresh sea water and
another in artificial sea water were held under otherwise iden¬
tical conditions. For tests longer than four hours, all
