Feeding Differences in Metridium
percentage of detritus ranged from 40 to 60%. One day
later the large anemones regurgitated large amounts of
mucus containing bubbles which floated to the surface.
Microscopic examination showed that mucus from both sizes
contained high populations of bacteria. Occasional
undigested phytoplankters and foraminifera occurred.
The relative abundance of the organisms most fre-
quently encountered in the environment and in the fecal
pellets of small and large Metridium are compared in
Fig. 2. The diet of small Metridium consists mainly
of the three types of worms from the pilings. The re-
mainder also consists largely of immediately adjacent
benthos. In sharp contrast, the food of large Metridium
represents mostly planktonic forms. However, the diet
here showed a greater variety; additional food organisms
not indicated as utilized by large Metridium in Fig. 2
due to their rare occurrance, include crab chelae, shrimp
appendages, gastropod larvae, tunicate tadpole larvae,
and barnacle nauplii. Fecal pellets from both large
and small anemones included sponge fragments and spicules,
crustacean fecal pellets (possibly from the guts of diÂ¬
gested prey), and the exoskeletons of barnacle appendages.
Most of the barnacle exoskeletons were probably molts
captured by the anemone, however fresh mouth parts and a
barnacle ovigerous lamella were also found on occasion.
