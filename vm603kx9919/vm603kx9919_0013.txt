Feeding Differences in Metridium
Large Metridium (20-35 cm in column height) cap-
tured Artemia larvae and Tigriopus and held them in the
tentacles, closing completely later. Larger prey re¬
quired more time and tentacular movement to be trans-
ferred to the mouth.
The large Metridium seem ideally adapted for cap-
ture of numerous planktonic organisms and the small
anemones seem better suited to larger prey in relation
to their body size.
3. Microscopic examination of the facal pellets pro-
duced in the lab revealed their contents to be mucus,
bacteria, animal remains, and unrecognizable detritus.
Small Metridium utilized mainly benthic organisms
from the wharf pilings as food. Nematode, polychaete,
and nemertean worms constituted the bulk of their diet.
Food organisms of the large Metridium consisted
largely of zooplankton. Copepods and crab zoea larvae
were the most abundant organisms in the plankton and in
the diet of the large anemones.
These results show a marked difference in the food
sources of the two sizes of Metridium. Feeding in each
case appears to be on those organisms most readily avail-
able for capture. The tentacles of small Metridium are
in close proximity to the surface of the pilings and its
characteristic benthos. The large anemones, with
