Feeding Differences in Metridium
10
A partially digested barnacle was seen being extruded by
one small Metridium in the field. Also included in the
pellets of large and small anemones were variable fracÂ¬
tions of sand, barnacle and mussel shell pieces, sea
urchin spines, anemone mesentarial filaments, and in
the large individuals, several fish scales. One large
anemone extruded intact chiton plates in the lab.
Clearly there is a marked difference in the sources
of the organisms eaten by small and large Metridium;
benthic and pelagic diets, respectively, are indicated.
Even most of the scattering of benthos including bryozoan
and hydroid fragments taken by the large anemones could
have been captured waterborne. Pieces of mussel and bar-
nacle may have been broken from higher on the pilings
and cascaded down. The food of the small Metridium is
found on or in close proximity to the surface of the
pilings. Certainly part of the dietary difference be-
tween large and small anemones relates to the distance
of the tentacles from the substrate in each case. In
a typical feeding posture, the animals are bent upword
from horizontal on a vertical face (Fig. 1d-e). Here
the tentacles of small anemones are close to the pilings,
less than 2 cm away and often brushing the surface.
The tentacles of large Metridium are usually at least
15 cm distant from the pilings. The same general argu-
ment holds for anemones on horizontal surfaces.
