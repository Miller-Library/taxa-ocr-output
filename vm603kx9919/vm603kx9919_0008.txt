Feeding Differences in Metridium
from there slid rapidly into the mouth. The sliding
may have involved both gravity and ciliary action.
In general, the small Metridium do not respond to
the smallest food, perhaps due to insufficient mechan-
ical stimulation of the tentacles. They efficiently
consume larger food, the extent of response increasing
with the size and degree of activity of prey. Large
anemones can easily capture numerous small food animals,
Much more movement and time are needed to handle larger
food. The great number and the arrangement of tentacles
and the behavior of large Metridium are adaptive toward
feeding on numerous microfood particles while the small
anemones can manage pieces larger in relation to their
body size. The deciding factor seems to be the distance
between the mouth and tentacles and the corresponding
difficulty in transferring particles to the mouth.
These conclusions are in agreement with the observations
made in previous studies.
Natural Foods of Metridium
In order to determine foods consumed by Metridium
under natural conditions, animals were collected in the
field, returned to the lab, and settled in clean aquaria
provided with filtered running seawater. Batham and
Pantin (1950) state that Metridium produce fecal pellets
within 48 hours after feeding. In the present study,
