Feeding Differences in Metridium
11
Previous investigators have assumed that large and
small Metridium may select foods of different size.
This may indeed be true to a degree, but present results
indicate the two size classes also geed on the organisms
most readily available for capture. Crab zoea larvae
bulk large in the diet of large Metridium compared to
their abundance in the plankton at the time of sampling.
This may not reflect selectivity, but merely a greater
number in the plankton when the anemone fed than at the
time the plankton tow was taken.
Summary
1. Studies were made of the feeding mechanisms and
sources of food in natural populations of small and
large Metridium senile on wharf pilings in Monterey,
california during April and May, 1975.
2. Artemia larvae and adults, the copepod Tigriopus,
and squid and Mytilus pieces produced different responses
in the small and large anemones when dispensed to tentacles
at various distances from the mouth.
Small Metridium (3-15 cm in column height) captured
food larger than 1 mm, the number of tentacles and por-
tion of the oral disc involved increasing with increased
size and activity of the prey.
