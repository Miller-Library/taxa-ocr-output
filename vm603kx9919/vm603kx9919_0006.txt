Feeding Differences in Metridium
were killed and caught readily with one tentacle, as
were Tigriopus of the same size. The method of transfer
of food to the mouth differed according to the distance
of the food-catching tentacle from the mouth. Tentacles
near the mouth carried the prey by ciliary current to
the tentacle tip, then bent letting the food fall into
the mouth. Tentacles on the edges of the oral disc
bent medially until the prey touched another tentacle
where it attached. It was then released from the first
tentacle and the process repeated until the food reached
an inner row of tentacles; ciliary currents then carried
it off the tentacle tip into the mouth.
Large Metridium responded differently to Artemia
larvae and Tigriopus. These foods were always caught
and held with one tentacle. The prey remained attached
to the tentacle, no movement toward the mouth occurring.
Shortly after capture, the anemone closed completely.
For small Metridium, the capture of active Artemia
adults required the participation of a localized group
of tentacles. The portion of the anemone's disc involved
in capture increased the larger the prey was in relation
to the size of the anemone. After food capture the
contracted group of tentacles relaxed and the prey re-
mained attached to one tentacle. The prey was then trans-
ferred by being passed medially from tentacle to tentacle
