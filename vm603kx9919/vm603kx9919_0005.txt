Feeding Differences in Metridium
opposing edges of each disc lobe are usually held fairly
close together, forming a solid thicket of tentacles
on top and a conical space below between tentacles and
disc in each lobe.
Feeding Mechanisms in Metridium
Reactions to different sizes and types of food were
observed in the various sizes of Metridium. Smaller
food was dispensed by a Pasteur pipette at a distance
such that the prey did not swim away but also was not
swept into the tentacles by the force of ejection.
Larger foods were presented with forceps. Foods pre-
sented included Artemia larvae of two sizes (1 mm and
1.5-2 mm long), Artemia adults (1 cm), the copepod
Tigriopus californicus (1.5 mm), and pieces of the squid
Loligo opalescens and the mussel Mytilus californianus
(1 cme). Responses were observed to food placed on the
tentacles at various distances from the mouth of the
anemone. The reactions of anemones 3-15 cm in height
were similar, and these animals are treated as one group,
Newly hatched Artemia larvae (1 mm) were not caught
by the small Metridium, but swam among the tentacles
and were seen to touch them with no apparent effect on
either animal. Slightly larger Artemia larvae (1.5-2 mm)
