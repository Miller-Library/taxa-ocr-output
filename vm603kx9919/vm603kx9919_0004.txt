Feeding Differences in Metridium
intermediate sizes (10-15 cm), and are often densely
arranged on the pilings. The largest animals tend to be
more solitary. However, all of the smaller and inter-
mediate sized specimens used in the present work were
collected from areas immediately around large individuals.
Morphology of the Tentacular Crown
A description of the oral disc and tentacles of
the different sized individuals of Metridium is essential
to understanding their feeding behavior (Fig. la, b, and c).
The smallest animals (less than 3 cm in column height)
have an unlobed disc bearing tentacles about 1 cm in
length, arranged in only a few rows. From this size
through the intermediate sizes the disc becomes larger
and progressively more lobed; tentacles remain the same
size but many more rows of tentacles are added.
There is a hiatus in the continuum of both complexity
and size between the intermediate and the large animals.
In the largest Metridium the disc is elaborately lobed
with six to eight petal-like extensions. The tentacles
remain about 1 cm in length but are very numerous esÂ¬
pecially at the margins of the disc and its lobes.
Several rows of larger tentacles surround the mouth and
extend partially down the center of each lobe. The
