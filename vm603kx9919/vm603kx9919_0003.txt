Feeding Differences in Metridium
on larger food. Hand attributes this "change in food
habits" with body size to the intertidal distribution
of the animals; small anemones live near shore where
the cresting waves carry larger food to them,, while
the larger anemones, living in deeper water receive a
constant supply of plankton.
No studies have yet been conducted to determine
the natural diet of Metridium of any size, or to sys-
tematically explore the feeding habits to test whether
the feeding preferences of small and large animals in-
dicated above are real and consistent differences.
This study was undertaken to discover the natural foods
of large and small individuals of Metridium.
Habitat of the Study Animals
The research was conducted at the Hopkins Marine
Station of Stanford University in Pacific Grove, Cal-
ifornia during April and May 1975. Animals were collected
from Monterey Wharf #2. There is a rough distribution
in size with smaller anemones tending to be higher on
the pilings and closer to shore. The very large
Metridium (20-35 cm in column height) occur only at the
end of the wharf within a few feet of the bottom. Small
individuals (less than 6 cm) intermingle with the
