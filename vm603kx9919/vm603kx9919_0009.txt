Feeding Differences in Metridium
animals freshly brought from the field defecated in be-
tween 24 and 48 hours. Pellets from 50 small, 15 inter-
mediate sized, and 18 large Metridium were examined under
a dissecting microscope. The pellets contained detritus
and food animals in various stages of digestion. ReÂ¬
cognizable remains of organisms were visually separated
from the unidentifiable detritus. When necessary for
identification, the remains were mounted in glycerine
and examined under a compound microscope. Relative
abundance of the different species or taxa was deter-
mined from counts and from qualitative estimates of their
percentage of the total biomass. To determine foods
available, material was scraped from the pilings adjacent
to the site where anemones were collected, and plankton
tows were taken at the collecting site. These collections
were examined, and relative abundance of organisms est-
imated as above. Phytoplankton, unrecognizable detritus,
and sand, abundant in the water, were not included as
food sources.
The small anemones each excreted several tiny pel-
lets and a dark reddish-brown mucus. The total volume
eliminated by each animal was approximately 0.1 ml, con-
sisting of 65% mucus, 30% detritus and 5% animal matter.
Large Metridium produced one or a few sizeable pellets,
total volume for each animal averaging 1.4 ml. The
