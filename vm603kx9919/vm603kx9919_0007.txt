Feeding Differences in Metridium
and finally dropped into the mouth.
When adult Artemia were fed to large Metridium
the response was restricted to the few tentacles involved
in capture,, or to a fraction of a lobe of the oral disc.
The opposing margins of a lobe pressed together enclosing
the prey. The tentacles then relaxed and and the food
was passed among adjacent tentacles toward the mouth.
The prey was transferred to the larger central tentacles
which deposited the food in the mouth. Often the Artemia
was moved randomly and sometimes it was discarded from
the edge of the disc.
Small Metridium fed squid and Mytilus pieces, caught
them with a group of tentacles. The entire group of
tentacles then moved the food toward the mouth, the
oral disc contracting until the food reached the lips.
Food transfer did not seem to involve ciliary currents
of the tentacles.
When squid and Mytilus were fed to large individuals,
the opposite sides of the disc lobe stimulated converged
to enclose the food. The tentacles immediately surrounding
the food began to wave, and a mucus coating with bubbles
was produced around the food. Food and mucus were
passes between tentacles into the cavity formed by the
sides of the disc lobe where it was hidden from view.
The food appeared again near the base of the lobe and
