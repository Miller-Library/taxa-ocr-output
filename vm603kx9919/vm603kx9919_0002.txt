Feeding Differences in Metridium
Metridium senile is an abundant anemone of circum-
polar distribution. On central and southern Californian
shores it occurs in large numbers in protected bays and
harbors (Hand, 1955). Much of the earlier work on M.
senile is summarized in Stephenson (1935), and the num-
erous papers of Batham and Pantin (e.g. 1950, 1950)
cover many aspects of structure and function.
Previous studies include some work on the feeding
behavior in Metridium. Parker (1898, 1905, 1917) des-
cribed reactions to food, ciliary currents and their
reversal on the lips and pharynx, and fatigue in the
feeding response due to repeated stimuli, but made no
investigation of the natural diet. Stephenson (1935),
echoing the opinions of Elmhirst (1925) and Pax (1928),
assumed that Metridium are zooplankton-feeders. This
conclusion, reached also by Hand (1955), is based solely
on the following laboratory and experimental observations.
1) Metridium accepts macroscopic food less readily than
other anemones. 2) They live for years in flowing
seawater aquaria with no food other than the plankton
in the water. 3) Large individuals reject or respond
sluggishly to macrofood. Elmhirst noted that large
Metridium reacted reluctantly even to copepods and crab
larvae in the lab. Small individuals accepted pieces
of mussel and fish readily, but seemed not to depend
