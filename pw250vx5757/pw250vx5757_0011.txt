C
Addendum
Experiments performed after the conclusion of the writing of the above
report indicate that there is a possibility that a mechanism of enzymatic
degradation of DDT is present in the starfish Pisaster ochraceus. The
procedure used in this experiment was identical to that of the experiments
above except that the period of equilibration in fresh sea water after expoÂ¬
sure to C++-DDT was extended from four hours to five days. Two peaks appeared
in the chromatogram. The identity of the two peaks has not been determined.
