An Investigation of DDT Degradation in the Starfish,
Sea Urchin, and Mussel
The me tabolism of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane)
to less toxic derivatives has been shown to be the probable mechanism of
DDT resistance in a number of invertebrate species. Enzymatic degradation
of DDT to DDE (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene) and small amounts
of DDA (bis-(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid) has been demonstrated in DDT-resist¬
ant strains of the house fly Musca domestica (Sternberg et al. 1950). Enzy-
matic dehydrochlorination of DDT to DDE has also been demonstrated in DDT-
resistant strains of the pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Bull and
Adkisson 1963), the blood-sucking leech Hirudo nipponia (Kimura et al. 1967),
the mosquito Culex fatigans (Kimura et al. 1965), and by the Madeira roach
Leucophaea maderae and the European Corn Borer Pyrausta nubilalis (Lindquist
and Dahm 1956). Kallman and Andrews (1963) demonstrated the reductive de¬
chlorination of DDT to DDD (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) by
yeast, requiring no DDE intermediate.
A recent study by Risebrough et al. (1967) noted the presence of the
DDT residues DDE and DDD in a large number of marine invertebrates. Recent
investigations have shown that DDT, DDE, and DDD are also present in sea
water in low concentrations (Odeman et al. 1968). The following experiments
with the starfish Pisaster ochracesus, the purple sea urchin Strongylocen-
trotus purpuratus, and the mussel Mytilus californianus were designed to
determine whether the DDE and DDD found in these species by Risebrough are
products of an in vivo enzymatic degradation of DDT or result from direct
uptake of DDT residues from the environment.
