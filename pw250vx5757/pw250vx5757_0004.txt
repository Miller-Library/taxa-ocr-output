However, our conclusions are subject to certain limitations. Different
periods of incubation or of equilibration in fresh sea water might yield
different results. The time periods in these experiments may have been too
short to allow for the induction of a DDT-degrading enzyme system; or, if
suchsn a system were present in the organism, degradation of DDT to DDE
or DDD may be so slow as to produce negligible end products in the period
of time studied. Incubations at higher or lower concentrations of C+-DDT
might also alter our results.
