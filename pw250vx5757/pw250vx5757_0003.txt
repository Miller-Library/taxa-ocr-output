mixture was then spotted and chromatographed using the procedure outlined
above.
Results
Preliminary chromatograms run with pure standards indicated that good
separation of DDT, DDE, and DDD could be attained using the method outlined
above. However, consistent Re values for DDT, DDE, and DDD were not obtained.
Results are shown graphically in Figure 1, which consists of chromato¬
grams of extracts prepared as previously specified. As seen, only a single
peak appears in each graph. These peaks were tentatively identified as DDT
by comparison of Re values with pure standards of DDT, DDE, and DDD run on
the same strips with the extracts.
Confirmation of the identity of these peaks was obtained by cochrom-
atography of extracts combined with pure C++-DDT. The cochromatograms are
shown graphically in Figure 2. In each case the single peak was of sufficient
amplitude to include from 2/3 to 3/ of the total counts spotted from the
extract and C-DDT combination. This suggests that none of the C+-DDT
taken up by any of the three species studied was converted to DDE or DDD.
Discussion
Previous studies of enzymatic degradation of DDT generally have been
limited to species showing evidence of the development of resistance to pro-
longed exposure to high levels of DDT. In this study we attempted to deter-
mine whether similar mechanisms of enzymatic degradation of DDT also exist
in three marine invertebrates. Under the conditions of these experiments,
Pisaster ochraceeus, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and Mytilus californianus
show no evidence of enzymatic degradation of DDT to DDE or DDD. This observa¬
tion implies that the DDE and DDD residues found in these species by Risebrough
are the result of direct uptake of these DDT derivatives from the marine
environment.
