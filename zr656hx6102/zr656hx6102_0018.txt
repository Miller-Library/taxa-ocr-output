Figure Legend:
Fig. 1. Mechanism of apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The basal molecular
mechanism is conserved in all metazoans.
Fig. 2. The life cycle of Botryllus schlosseri.
Fig. 3. The asexual life cycle of Botryllus schlosseri, otherwise known as the
blastogenic cycle. Each new generation of zooids is larger than the previous generation.
Fig. 4. The nucleotide and protein sequences of bel-2 B and B+ in Botryllus schlosseri.
These distinct sequences belong to the same gene family and are only separated by a few
amino acids. The underlined regions are highly conserved.
Fig. 5. The phylogenetic tree relating Botryllus schlosseri to several vertebrates and
Caenorhabditis elegans, based on the bel-2 locus. Numbers indicate gene distances.
Fig. 6. The results of the Southern and Reverse Northern Blots probed with a mixture
of the radioactively labeled bel-2 B and B++ probes. The method lacks the resolution to
separate the probes because they are so close in sequence.
