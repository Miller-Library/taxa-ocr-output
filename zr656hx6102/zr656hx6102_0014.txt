detailed study of the expression patterns of bcl-2 B and B+, a combination of loss and
gain-of-function experiments will determine the apoptosis regulatory function of these
genes in B.schlosseri conclusively.
Conclusions:
The results of this study suggest that there are at least seven independent bel-2
genes in B.schlosseri, and that the coding region of bel-2 B/B+ is approximately 1.1 kb in
length. According to the phylogenetic tree based on bel-2, B.schlosseri is closer to
vertebrates than it is to C.elegans. Bcl-2 B exhibits consistent expression throughout the
blastogenic life cycle while bel-2 B+ seems to be down regulated in the later stages of the
cycle when the parent zooids age and experience takeover. The differential regulation of
two genes of the bel-2 gene family suggest that apoptosis in B.schlosseri is controlled by
a mechanism similar to that of vertebrates and C.elegans.
