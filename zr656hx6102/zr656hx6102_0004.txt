supply. B.schlosseri is an interesting model system because the organism undergoes a
weekly asexual budding process to give rise to a large colony of asexually-derived,
genetically identical offspring that share a common vascular system. With each new
cycle, blastozooids regenerate complex organs such as blood, heart gastrointestinal
systems, gill arches, nervous system, gametes etc. (Milkman, 1967) If a zooid is separated
from the colony, it can regrow the whole colony using the same asexual budding process.
Thus the individuals are all linked, but not dependent upon one another.
The asexual life cycle, otherwise known as the blastogenic cycle, is a seven day
process. (Fig. 3) Stage A begins with the opening of the feeding siphons in the zooids. As
soon as the siphons open, the eggs within the parent zooids are fertilized. At this point,
primary buds are microscopic. Two days later, stage B begins with the establishment of
the heartbeat and circulatory sytem in the primary buds, linking them to the rest of the
colony. The primary buds have grown, but the secondary buds are only a thickening in
the epithelial wall of the primary buds. At any given moment during the blastogenic cycle
there are three individuals at various stages in their development. (Berrill 1941a) During
stage C, organogenesis begins in the secondary buds, and the primary buds continue to
grow. The parent zooids begin to age by losing pigmentation and size. At the end of the
sixth day, the colony is faced with an event called takeover, or stage D, in which the
parent zooids close their feeding siphons, undergo synchronized apoptosis, and are
resorbed by the primary buds. The primary buds then open their siphons and begin a new
cycle. (Watkins 1958) The apoptosis of half of a colony each week might seem
energetically costly, but each successive generation is larger than the previous zooids.
Each zooid also has a limited capability of gonad production, and smaller zooids lack
