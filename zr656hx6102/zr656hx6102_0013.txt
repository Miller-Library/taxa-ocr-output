mature zooids that degrades in order for the functional zooids to age. Previous studies
show that the zooid lifespan is determined by a clock mechanism that is bud dependent.
When a primary bud is surgically removed during stage A, the colony remains alive for
48-72 hours until a new bud is generated. Since the vascular system is established in
stage B, only two days after stage A begins, there is evidence that a bud-derived factor is
released into the circulatory system at this early stage, irreversibly deciding the zooid
lifespan. (R. Lauzon, pers. comm., and Chang and Lauzon, 1993)
An ambiguity that cannot be resolved with the RNase protection assay is that it
does not provide information about the spatial localization of the different RNA species.
A certain bel-2 species might be regionally down regulated during one stage of the life
cycle while up regulated in another region, and this would average out to the same band
in the assay. For this reason it is essential to obtain probes specific to the coding regions
of the bel-2 partial genes. This will allow a more detailed and specific spatial and
temporal study of bcl-2 RNA localization. The in situ hybridizations Iattempted on
wholemount sections in this study would be ideal to determine localization of bel-2
mRNA, however the method needs to be tailored to the organism. RNA is also very hard
to work with because it can be denatured very easily. The non-differential fluorescence
observed in in situ hybridizations was visible in both FITC and UV channels on the
fluorescence microscope. I had also done PI staining to get an idea where the cells were
in the sections. There is a possibility that B.schlosseri tissue has auto fluorescence due to
circulating pigment cells, or that the PI fluorescence leaked into the other channels when
I viewed them subsequently. To see what the problem with this part of the study was,
further experimentation is necessary with new probes and a confocal microscope. Ã„fter a
