RNase Protection Assay
Overnight hybridization reactions (2 X10' cpm of each probe and lug total RNA from
stage A, midcycle and Takeover-D) were co-precipitated in IOM NH,Oac, glycogen and
ethanol and incubated in hybridization probe overnight at 42°C. I used yeast tRNA for
two sets of control tubes for each probe. Before each use, RNA probes were denatured by
incubating at 95°C for 5 minutes to ensure higher strand specificity. The reactions were
then digested with RNase A/ RNase TI in Digestion Buffer at a 1:1000 dilution for 30
minutes at 37°C. For one set of the control tubes, no RNase was added to the mixture.
After the digestion, the RNase Inactivation/ Precipitation Buffer III and 2 uL of yeast
tRNA were added to the reactions and incubated at -20°C for 15 min. The RNA was
pelleted by centrifugation at top speed for 15 min. and resuspended in Gel Loading
Buffer II. The samples were loaded onto a 40% acrylamide gel after incubation at 950C
for 5 min to solubilize and denature RNA. After running for 2.5 hours, the gel was
transferred to chromatography paper, covered with saran wrap, dried, and exposed to
double-sided film for 2 days at -80°C. (Ambion, RPA III kit)
Southern Blot/ Reverse Northern Blot
For the Reverse Northern Blot I made cDNA from stages A, B, C, and D in the asexual
life cycle by PCR-amplifying single-stranded cDNA in 50 uL reactions. For the Southern
Blot I set up 30 uL reactions with Eco RI and Pst I, the appropriate buffer, and genomic
B.schlosseri DNA for bel-2 B/B+. The restriction digests went overnight at 37°C.
Afterwards, I ran all the samples on a large 1% agarose gel for sufficient resolution and
transferred them to a nylon membrane using a capillary/southern blot. In the rotating
