unknown. However it is likely that changes in gene expression are a fundamental part of
this process.
The key regulatory protein of apoptosis in C.elegans is ced-9, whose expression
results in the prevention of the process. This single protein corresponds to a wide array of
proteins that belong to the bel-2 gene family in vertebrates. This gene family includes at
least 15 regulatory proteins whose differential expression result in both the prevention
and the promotion of apoptosis. Certain anti-apoptotic genes from the human bel-2 gene
family are similar enough to be interchangeable with ced-9. Expression of human bel-2
results in a reduction of apoptotic events in C.elegans. (Vaux et al., 1992) Recent studies
have shown that the bel-2 gene codes for a mitochondrial ion channel and a docking
protein in vertebrates. Ã„fter a premitochondrial decision step, upstream signal
transduction pathways are activated to regulate Bcl-2 proteins, followed by the release
and activation of caspases. A decrease in this protein prevents it from inhibiting different
apoptotic pathways. (Hsu and Hsueh, 2000 and Schiavone et al., 2000)
This study uses Botryllus schlosseri as a model system. They are common just
below the watermark on pilings, eel grass, and under rocks, especially in harbors where
water turbulence is low. (Milkman, 1967). This organism is a colonial protochordate that
reproduces sexually to produce a free-swimming tadpole, with many vertebrate
characteristics, including a hollow dorsal notochord, gill slits, segmented muscles, and a
tail. After attachment, the tadpole metamorphoses into an oozoid, which asexually
divides to become a non-chordate sessile, filter-feeding adult. (Fig. 2) A colony of
B.schlosseri is made up of a group of systems that resemble flowers. Each petal of the
flower is a distinct individual, or zooid, that is linked to the others by a common blood
