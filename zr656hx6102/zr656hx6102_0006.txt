Preparation of riboprobes by in vitro RNA transcription
Sense and antisense (T3/T7) strand-specific ssRNA probes were derived from plasmid
vectors containing the partial-length cDNA clones of the genes, bel-2 B, bcl-2 B+,
tubulin and cytoactin. The different riboprobes were prepared from appropriate PCR-
generated cDNA fragments flanked by non-specific phage polymerase promoter
sequences, T3 and T7. For RNA in vitro transcription and labeling with fluorochromes,
reaction mixtures contained 200 ng template DNA, 1 mM ATP, GTP, and CTP, 0.65 mM
UTP, 0.35 mM DIG-oxygenin-11-UTP(Boehringer Mannheim)/O.35 mM sa-2PJUTP,
transcription buffer 5X, RNA polymerase T7 and T3, and H2O to a final volume of 20uL.
Transcription proceeded in a 37°C water bath, shielded from light for 1 hour, followed by
a 30 min. digestion with RNase-free DNase at 37°C. Unincorporated nucleoside
triphosphates were removed by running the reaction products through an S-400 gel
column with centrifugation. (Promega, protocols and applications guide, P. 59-61)
Analysis of RNA transcripts on agarose gel
Before use, the RNA transcripts were analyzed for length by staining with ethidium
bromide on a 3% agarose gel. Dilutions of 1:100 and 1:200 were made of each probe. The
overall nucleic acid content of the probe dilutions were analyzed using a
spectrophotometer. Based on the results the probes were all diluted to a concentration of
lOng/uL. Radioactive probes had an average scintillation count of 2.5 x10° cpm/uL.
