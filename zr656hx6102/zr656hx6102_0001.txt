Abstract:
Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian that reproduces the entire colony every week
through a synchronized asexual budding process. At the end of this seven day cycle, all
functional zooids undergo synchronized apoptosis and are resorbed by blastozooids of the
new generation. There is evidence that suggests a similar mechanism controls apoptosis
in many vertebrates and invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. In
mammalian cells, expression of certain genes from the bel-2 gene family regulates
apoptosis, the physiological process that eliminates unwanted cells. The purpose of this
study was to investigate the role of bcl-2 in apoptosis of B.schlosseri. This study shows
that there are at least seven members of the bcl-2 gene family expressed in B. schlosseri.
The sequences of two isolated clones of the bel-2 gene, called bel-2 B and bel-2 B+, show
a 40% homology with known vertebrate bel-2 sequences. These genes exhibit differential
expression throughout the asexual life cycle. Bcl-2 B maintains a consistent level of
expression throughout the asexual life cycle of the colony while bel-2 B+ is down
regulated after the early stages of the zooid lifespan. The results of this study suggest that
the bcl-2 gene family might regulate apoptosis in the asexual life cycle of B.schlosseri as
well.
