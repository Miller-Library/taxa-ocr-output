PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS. The sections were acetylated with
0.1 M triethanolamine (TEA) buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.25% acetic anhydride.
Prehybridization incubation was at 37°C in 4X SSC containing 50% formamide.
(Maniatis et al., 1989) Äfterwards, each section was drained and overlaid with
hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, IX Denhardt's solution, 4X
SSC, 10 mM BME, 1 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA and 1Ong of DIG-RNA probes.
Sections were covered with coverslips and incubated overnight at 42°C in a humidifier.
After hybridization, sections were sorted according to probes and placed in Coplin jars.
Coverslips were removed by soaking in 2XSSC, followed by washes with 2XSSC and
IXSSC in a shaking 37°C water bath. Any unbound RNA probe was digested by
incubating in NTE Buffer containing 20ug/mL RNase A for 30 min at 37°C (500mM
Nacl, 1OmM Tris, ImM EDTA, pH 8.0). Sections were washed for a final hour in
O.IXSSC in the 37°C shaking water bath.
Immunological Detection Enhancement
The Fluorescence Antibody Enhancer Set for DIG Detection (Boehringer Mannheim) was
used for this part. After ISH, slides were washed and incubated for 30 min at room
temperature with 50 mL IX blocking solution per Coplin jar to block unspecific antibody
binding. Afterwards the slides were overlaid with anti-DIG Antibody in a 1:25 dilution in
IX blocking solution and incubated for 60 min at 37°C in a humidifier. Slides were
washed in washing buffer (0.2% Tween 20 in IXPBS) at 37°C between antibody
incubations. The secondary antibody incubation of anti-mouse-Ig-DIG and the tertiary
antibody incubation with anti-DIG-fluorescein (FITC) were under the same conditions as
