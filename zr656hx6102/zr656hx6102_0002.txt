Introduction:
Apoptosis is the programmed death of cells characterized by cell shrinkage, loss
of structure in the plasma membrane, and apoptotic body formation. It is a fundamental
process during the initial development of the organism, especially in the embryo and
nervous system. Apoptosis also plays a key role in the maintenance of the immune
system in the adult. Maintaining the balance between extensive apoptosis and
proliferating cells is essential. Defects in apoptosis have been observed in 85% of all
cancers. To prevent mishaps, many different and redundant cell signaling pathways exist
in vertebrates and contribute to the maintenance of the adult organism. (Hsu and Hsueh,
2000) Widely characterized gene families, such as the bel-2 gene family in humans and
ced-9 in Caenorhabditis elegans, are responsible for the regulation of this vital process.
This study is a part of an overall research project that aims to characterize the
developmental steps and underlying molecular pathways that lead to apoptosis.
The basal molecular mechanism of apoptosis was first discovered in C.elegans
and is conserved throughout all metazoans. Apoptosis is a one way process. Once a cell
has committed to apoptosis, it will certainly die. (Schiavone et al., 2000) Apoptosis
begins with the activation of the apoptotic pathway, releasing a wide array of nucleases
and proteases that digest the cell from within. At this point, a neighboring cell engulfs the
dying cell, preventing the intracellular components from contaminating the outside
environment. Once the corpse is resorbed, there is no trace left of the apoptotic cell.
(Fig.1) Thus apoptosis is both a process of destruction as well as one of resorption. The
exact mechanisms that underlie the decision between the life and death of a cell are
