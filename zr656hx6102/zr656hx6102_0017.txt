Table 1: A summary of terms specific to Botryllus schlosseri that are important in
understanding its life history.
Sausage-like blind termini of blood vessels commonly found in the
Ampullae
periphery of colonial urochordates
Asexual development process in which budding of new zooids occurs
Blastogenesis
from existing blastozooids in a botryllid colony. A typical blastogenesis
cycle at 18-20Â°C lasts about a week
A single individual in a colony of colonial protochordates generated by
Zooid
asexual reproduction. Zooids are arranged in star-shaped rosette,
serpentine, or ladder-like structures called systems that share cloacal
apertures
Also known as allogenic resorption, a genetically controlled
Colony
phenomenon in tunicate chimeras in which all blastozooids of one of the
resorption
partners are morphologically eliminated by the other partner
Colony
Ability to discriminate self colonies form nonself colonies within the
specificity
same species, resulting in fusion or rejection
First sessile zooid metamorphosed form a free swimming tadpole larva,
Oozoid
itself generated by sexual reproduction
Last stage in blastogenesis, where the new blastozooids take over the
Takeover
colony from the previous generation
