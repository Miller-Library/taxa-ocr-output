life cycle of B.schlosseri. However, this method lacks the resolution to differentiate
between similar sequences as well, so I did an RNase protection assay. This assay is very
sensitive and can differentiate between RNA species that have only a few amino acids
that are different. The bands on the gel are a result of radioactively labeled antisense
RNA probes binding to complimentary RNA strands of target RNA. The lack of bands in
the sense control lanes show that the RNA probes were specific in their binding. The
housekeeping gene tubulin gave consistent bands throughout the life cycle, confirming
that the RNA samples were consistent in quality and amount.
The differential expression of bel-2 B and bcl-2 B+ suggests that they might
regulate apoptosis in B.schlosseri in a manner similar to vertebrates and C.elegans. These
results are a confirmation of preliminary studies done in the Weissman lab. Recent
studies show that an important step in the down regulation of bel-2 might be due to a
highly conserved destabilizing AU-rich region in the 3â€™ end of bel-2 mRNA. Degradation
of mRNA is crucial in the regulation of bcl-2 expression in vertebrates as well as in the
ced-9 gene of C.elegans. This destabilizing region is seen in both vertebrates and
Celegans. (Schiavone et al., 2000) An idea for future studies includes isolating the
mRNA of bel-2 B+ from a colony to see if it contains this AU-rich region on the 3' end
as well.
Bel-2 B might be responsible for shaping the body plan of the primary and
secondary buds growing throughout the blastogenic life cycle. An important point to
remember is that apoptosis is essential both in embryonic development as well as
maintenance of the adult organism, so it should be occurring throughout the whole life
cycle in different tissues. On the other hand bel-2 B+ might be an anti-apoptotic agent for
