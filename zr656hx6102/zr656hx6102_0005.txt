these structures altogether. By renewing zooids each week, the colony maintains its
reproductive capabilities. (Berrill 1941b)
In addition, when Botryllus colonies encounter histocompatible kin in the wild,
they exhibit vascular fusion. The colonies undergo a natural transplantation reaction
where the vasculatures of the two colonies fuse together to form a single unit with a
common blood supply. If these colonies are artificially separated, one colony will at least
partially express the DNA of the other colony. This foreign contribution to development
is known as parasitism and might have a genetic basis. If the two colonies are not
compatible, the ampullae will exhibit an immunological reaction and local apoptosis will
occur, resulting in the resorption of the ampullae. This reaction to non-self cells produces
points of rejection and the two colonies shrink away from eachother. (Stoner and
Weissman, 1996 and Stoner et al., 1999) This observation shows that apoptosis occurs in
different contexts within the colony and might produce the need for different genes to
control different instances of apoptosis in B.schlosseri.
Materials and Methods:
Cells and animals
dHIOB cells were grown in suspension cultures and on circular agarose plates at 37Â°C
after electroporation with plasmids containing bel-2 B, bcl-2 B+, cytoactin and tubulin
inserts. The partial clones were previously isolated from B.schlosseri stock grown in
mariculture tanks at Hopkins Marine Station.
