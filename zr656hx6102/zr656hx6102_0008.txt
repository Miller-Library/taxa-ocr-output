hybridization chamber, the nylon membrane was radioactively probed for bel-2 B/B+
overnight at 65°C, washed in O.IX SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C in a shaking water bath. It
was then exposed to film for 3 days at -80°
Fixation of cells and whole mount sections for conventional fluorescence microscopy
From B.schlosseri colonies grown in mariculture tanks, approximately 3 x 10° blood cells
were isolated by cutting ampullae of 3 systems and extracting with a micropipette. The
cells were washed in twice in Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS) (Maniatis et al., 1989) for 3
minutes, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and then cytospun at 1000g onto a
glass slide. The cells were permeabilized by immersion in 100% ice-cold acetone and
washed in HBS. The cells were then processed for in situ hybridizations. For whole
mount sections, 2-3 systems from homozygotic crosses Byd 196 were taken from each
stage A-D in the asexual life cycle of the colonies. The cells were fixed in 2%
10OL
paraformaldehyde in ASW (27.65g Nacl, 0.67g KCl, 1.36g CaClz.zH20, 4.66g
MgCl2.6H20, 6.29g MgsÖ4.7H20, 0.18g NaHCO3/ 1 L, pH 8.2) overnight and were
then transferred to 30% sucrose in filtered seawater for 2 days. The systems were
embedded in OCT, frozen over dry ice and cut in 6um sections in a cryostat.
In situ hybridization (ISH)
All solutions were prepared with DEPC-treated ddH20 and PBS (Maniatis et al., 1989).
Sections were incubated in PBS, followed by PBS with 100mM glycine, PBS with 0.3%
Triton X-100, PBS, and permeabilized by TE Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0, 1 ug/mL RNase-free Proteinase K). The sections were post-fixed by incubating in
