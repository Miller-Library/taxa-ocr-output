the primary antibody. Afterwards slides were stained with propidium iodide (Pl) (5-10
ng/mL) and air dried in a dark room covered with mounting media and a coverslip (50%
glycerol, 50% PBS). The signals were detected with a conventional fluorescence
microscope.
Results:
In order to study the molecular pathways of apoptosis in B.schlosseri, I probed
genomic B.schlosseri DNA with bel-2 B/B+ probes made from bel-2 clones isolated
using degenerate PCR. To see partial nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences of
B and B+, see Fig. 4. Based on these sequences and known bel-2 sequences of other
vertebrates and C.elegans, I constructed a phylogenetic tree. (Fig.5) Both sequences had a
26% homology with ced-9 in C.elegans, and a 40% homology with vertebrate bel-2
sequences. In the Southern Blot, which are the two lanes on the far left, both restriction
digests contained multiple bands. The Pstl digest contained at least 3 bands, while the
EcoRl digest contained at least 7 bands. (Fig. 6) For the Reverse Northern Blot in the
four lanes to the left of the DNA ladder, bel-2 B/B+ probing of cDNA isolated from
different stages of the blastogenic cycle (A, B,C and D) yielded a single 1.1 kb band in
stage A. (Fig. 6) The RNase protection assays gave consistent bands for bel-2 B
throughout the blastogenic cycle (A, midcycle, takeover), while bel-2 B+ displayed
differential expression, with bands becoming lighter in later stages. The sense controls
showed no bands for each probe, using RNA from stage A. The RNA quality and amount
control tubulin gave consistent bands throughout the blastogenic cycle as well. (Fig. 7)
For a graphical representation of band strengths in the RNase protection assay, see Fig.8.
