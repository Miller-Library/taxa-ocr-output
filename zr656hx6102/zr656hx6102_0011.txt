The in situ hybridizations did not yield conclusive results. Both sense and antisense
probes contained equal fluorescence in the actin control and sections probed with bel-2 B,
B+. (data not shown)
Discussion:
In this study, I investigated the regulation of apoptosis in the colonial tunicate,
B.schlosseri, focusing on the gene bel-2. The two bel-2 clones isolated from B.schlosseri
have a 40% homology with vertebrate bel-2 sequences and a 26% homology with the
ced-9 sequence in C.elegans. The proximity of B.schlosseri to the vertebrates in the
phylogenetic tree led me to suspect the involvement of bcl-2 in the apoptotic pathway of
B.schlosseri. At least 15 genes belonging to this gene family regulate apoptosis in
vertebrates. The multiple bands in Southern Blots of genomic B.schlosseri DNA suggest
that there are at least seven independent bel-2 genes in this colonial tunicate. The
recognition sites of the restriction enzymes Pstl and EcoRl were not included within the
regions that the B/B+ probes bound to the DNA, suggesting that each fragment represents
an independent gene. One interesting band in the EcoRl digest is at 3.2 kb. This band is
darker than the rest, indicating that more probe bound to it compared to the other
fragments. This could be because both the bcl-2 B and bel-2 B+ probes found binding
sites on the fragment, increasing the activity of the band. Since this method lacks the
specificity to differentiate between the two sequences, the probes were used as a mixture.
From the Reverse Northern Blot, I saw that bel-2 B/B+ are expressed strongly in
the early stage A of the blastogenic cycle, but expressed less or not at all in the later
stages. The cDNA for this blot was made from DNA taken from different stages of the
