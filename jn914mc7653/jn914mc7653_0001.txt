1. Introduction
The following study was undertaken to see if a hatching
substance similar to that reported by Crisp and Spencer (1958)
and Barnes (1959) for Balanus balanoides is also involved in
the hatching of nauplii larvae from the barnacle Chthamalus
dalli. Balanus balanoides has only one brood a year and the
whole population release their larvae synchronously. Barnes (1962)
has reported that this spawning is correlated with plankton
blooms. Crisp and Spencer proposed that a hatching substance,
possibly a metabolic product, formed by the adult animal
in response to feeding caused this synchronous release.
Barnes (1959) suggested that the substance might be a neurosec-
ratory substance.
This type of hatching substance would be beneficial to
barnacles such as Balanus balanoides which hatch synchronous-
ly at certain times of the year. It is not at all clear,
however, that the other barnacle genera exhibit this type of
hatching and have hatching substances. Indeed, the studies on
hatching and reproductive behavior of Chthamalus dalli reported
in this paper indicate there is no synchronous hatching or hatch-
ing substance in this barnacle.
The animals used in this research were collected from various
points on the Pacific coast in the area of Monterey, California.

hatching of nauplii in vitro

The two ovigerous lamellae of Chthamalus dalli lie
