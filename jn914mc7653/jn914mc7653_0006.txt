of larvae in each beaker. After a day the animals were disected
and the percentage of animals without lamellae computed.
This method proved to be invalid, however, because the controls
differed among thenselves as much as did the experimental
populations from the controls.
A feeding experiment similar to the above extract
experiment was run at the same time to deternine whether
feeding triggered larval release as in Balanus balanoide
(Crisp and Spencer, 1958). Barnacles on rocks and shells
were placed in filtered sea water and some were fed phyto¬
plankton. These experiments were inconclusive for the same
reason as the experiment above, because an adequate control
could not be found.
5. Field work
To explain this apparent lack of factors affecting
hatching, I carried out a field study to get information
about the in vivo brooding of embryos by Chthanalus dalli
My main study was done on a vertical rock face along Cannery
Row in Monterey, California. This rock face was covered by
hthamalus
illi from 0.5 foot to 5.5 feet above the mean low
tide level. I divided this height up into eight eight-inch
zones, with zone one being the lowest. Animals were collected
from each of the zones and the percent of animals with
ovigerous lanellae was calculated. (see table 1). The stages
of the embryos were deternined under a microscope. Four
stages were considered: 1.one- and two-celled e¬
gs 2.nulti-
cellular to limb buds of nauplii 3.early nauplii 4. fully-
formed nauplii. The results of this study are in table 2,
