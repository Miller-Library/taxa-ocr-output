expressed as percent of the total number of animals with
lamellae in each zone.
Examination of table 2 indicates that there is a decrease
in the number of lamellae found in the higher aninals.
Further observations on the C. dalli populations at Hopkins
Marine Station and at a point on the Pacific coast about three
niles south of Carnel, California, yielded similar results.
At Hopkins Marine Station two horizontal rock faces in the
same area and subjected to the same wave action were examined.
The lower rock was at 1.5 feet above the mean low tide and
the higher rock was at the 5 foot level. The higher C.
dalli
population had no animals with lamellae, while 93.43 of the
lower population had lamellae. At the other location I sampled
various populations, some on mussel shells at a 1 foot level,
some on rocks at 4 feet, and others on rocks at 8 feet.
The upper population had no animals with lamellae, the niddle
population had 36.73 with lamellae, and the lower one had
86.73 with lanellae.
In addition to the above work, I sought to correlate the
observed hatching behavior with the data obtained by Galen
Hilgard of Hopkins Marine Station on the yearly pattern of
dalli populations
brooding enbryos. Her data on Chthanalu
at Hopkins Marine Station is shown in figure 1. Figures 2

Investigation.
