In another experiment animals were disected and one
lanella was quickly put in the dark, the other being left
in the light. No differences in hatching were found.
b. Chemical factors
In these experinents I attempted to discern whether an
extract made fron grinding up bodies, shells, or tissue of
Chthamalus dalli accelerated hatching, as found by Crisp and
Speneer (1958) for Balanus balanoides. Extracts of C.
dalli
were prepared by grinding the whole animal in a teflon
homogenizer in artificial sea water and then centrifuging
to remove any particulate matter. Two lamellae were taken
fron the same animal and washed several'tines in artificial
sea viter. They were then placed on microscope slides
and a drop of extract plus artificial sea water was placed
on one and a drop of artificial sea water on the other.
Hatching in both lamellae was observed under the compound
nicroscope and no consistant differences in the time of
release of the first nauplii were noted. The nunber of
nauplii released after 30 to 60 minutes was also not sig-
nificantly different.
4. Factors affecting hatching in vivo
I collected animals on small rocks and mussel shells
and placed groups of 40 in beakers of aerated artificial
sea water. The Chthamalus extract was then added to some
of the beakers, with the remaining beakers left as controls.
The beakers were checked hourly for release of larvae, but at
no time was there any noticible difference in the number
