same animal were placed in artificial sea water (Harvey, 1955)
and used for each trial. One lamella served as a control and
the other was subjected to the experimental conditions.
Preliminary experiments indicated that the percentage of
eggs that hatched in a given amount of tine varied considerably
between lamellae obtained from the same animal and subjected
to the same conditions. The time taken for the first release
of larvae and the total number of larvae released per unit
time were much more constant. The reasons for this are not
clear. One possibility is that the surface areas of the two
lamellae would be more nearly the same than their surface to
volume ratio. Since the outer larvae hatch first, hatching
seems to depend on surface area, and hence the percentage hatching
would depend on the surface to volume ratio. The effect of
a larger surface area is clearly seen when the lamellae
are broken into several pieces,as the rate of hatching greatly
increases with such fragnentation.
To analyse hatching rate in the following experiments,
I used both the time of release of the first nauplii and
the nunber of nauplii which would hatch in a unit of tine.
To determine if the hatching process depends on oxygen,
one lamella of each pair was placed in deoxygenated artificial
sea water (through which nitrogen had been bubbled) and the
other lamella was placed in artificial sea water through
which oxygen had been bubbled. The hatching was compared,
and in all cases there was no hatching in the lamellae in
deoxygenated water even though hatching occurred in the cor-
responding lamellae in oxygenated water.
