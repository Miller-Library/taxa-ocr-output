Discussion
Findings on possible physical factors affecting hatching
in Chthanalus dalli were similar to those obtained by Crisp
and Spencer (1958) in their work on Balanus balanoides.
The liberation of the larvae from the egg nembranes is
apparently an oxygen-requiring process carried on by the larvae.
This process is not affected by light. The nost important
physical factor affecting hatching appears to be the frag-
mentation of the egg mass, since breaking up the lamellae causes
a narked increase in the rate of hatching and the total
number of larvae which hatch.
I found no chemical substance from barnacle extracts
which affected hatching. I cannot conclusively rule out the
possibility that some chemical does affect the whole animal:
I simply could not find any way to set up an experimental
population of animals with consistent controls. It seens
as if these sane problems must have been present for Barnes
(1959) and Crisp and Spencer (1958), but no mention of any
such problem is made in their papers.
Perhaps one factor which could explain the difference
in hatching behavior between Balanus balanoides and Chthanalus
lalli is the difference in the reproductive behavior of the
two animals. The animals that both Barnes and Crisp worked
with were animals living in an environment where they only
liberated larvae in response to plankton bloons. Data on
the reproductive behavior of Chthamalus dalli, however, shows
that this barnacle posesses lamellae throughout the year,
with the exception of the late fall and early winter. There
is apparently no major larval release correlated with the
