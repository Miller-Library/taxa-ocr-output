peak plankton bloon. There also appears to be no correlaÂ¬
tion between temperature and larval release during the year.
The above conparisons are tenuous without knowing the period
of larval development in vivo, which might be difficult to
obtain in a non-synchronously reproducing population.
The study done on the Chthamalus population at
Cannery Row also indicates that there seems to be no factor
synchronizing hatching. Lamellae were equally abundant at
all stages of development, indicating that developnent was
not arrested at the nauplius stage in preparation for some
environnental trigger as in B. balanoides.
One factor which I cannot explain is that the percentage
of lamellae decreases greatly with the height of the animals
above the water. Barnes (1962) found the same situation to
exist for Balanu
balanoides and postulated that it night
be due to earlier hatching triggered by a concentration of
hatching substance because of longer periods out of water or
by longer periods of time in oxygen. Neither of these
reasons seens likely for C. dalli.
In order to understand the hatching behavior of nauplii
tha
malus dalli, more data is required on the repro-
fron C
ductive and hatching behavior in the field. Laboratory
experiments vith adequate controls must also be devised.

Experiments were done with Chthamalus dalli to determine
what factors affect the rate of both in vivo and in vitro
hatching of nauplii. Aside from mechanical fragnentation of
the lamellae,which increases the rate of hatching, no
