of development (from the undivided eggs to the multicellular
stage) there is a transparent membrane enclosing the whole
lamella, but this membrane breaks down in the later stages,
with only scattered remnants of it remaining visible. There
is also a breakdown of the cementing substance holding the
eggs together. The lamellae containing fully-formed nauplii
can easily be broken apart into individual enbryos with a probe
or scalpel, but the early stage embryos remain together in clumps
after such treatment.
b. Egg case strength
An experiment was done to determine whether the strength
of the egg membranes changes during the course of development.
Enbryos in the early stages of development and nauplii ready to
hatch were broken free from a lamella and placed on a slide with
a drop of water and a coverslip over the. Small weights
were then pleced on the coverslip to determine the force
needed to rupture the menbrane. For both cases it was found
that the nenbranes first ruptured when the weight was between
twenty and twenty-five grams. The rupture occurred as a
small hole in one end and was always at the anterior end
of the nauplii enbryos.
c. Hatching of nauplii in vitre
For some barnacles it has been noted that hatching
in vivo is preceeded by the fragmentation of the egg mass,
and that both hatched and unhatched larvae are extruded from
the adult. I have not been able to observe the in vivo hatching
of Chthanalus dalli, but in vitro the hatching process is
not preceeded by such a fragmentation. When the larvae break
