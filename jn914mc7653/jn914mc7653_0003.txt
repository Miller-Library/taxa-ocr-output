out, the egg cases remain cemented together in a single
clump. The outer animals hatch first, but there are usually
a large number of larvae near the center of the lamella
which do not hatch, even if left in aerated sea water for
several days. Some of these inner larvae move in the egg
cases after the lamella is first placed in sea water but
then stop.
If completely developed lamellae are removed from the
barnacles and examined microscopically, no movement can usually
be detected. But if several drops of sea water are added,
movenent begins and the nauplii soon hatch. It is not
obvious why this hatching should occur, because according to
Crisp and Southward (1956) the mantle cavity is continually
being washed with sea water.
The hatching process is preceeded by vigorous movenents
of the nauplii. The larvae appear to use contractions of
the body and pressure of the appendages against the posterior
end of the egg case to rupture the anterior end of the case
and force thenselves through. Hatching always occurs through
this anterior end and appears to cause the same type of
splitting of the egg membrane each time. The split occurs as
a snooth line running both dorsally and ventrally from the
anterior end half-way down the egg case.

A number of physical factors might affect hatching. I
