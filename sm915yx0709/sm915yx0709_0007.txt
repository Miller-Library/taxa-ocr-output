Table III eleerly shavs that the larger snimals heve a levee
fesding rate then the e√¶aller snails. The overall differenee
ef 17% in feeding rate found between sunlicht and constant
darknecs is toe small to support the possibility of a photo-
kinetie reeponze in feeding sctivity. The mean feeding rute
in light (0.012 gne/ge of animal/day) probably represents the
meximum found in the field, einee the feed was evsileble in
exesse and shown to be highly preferred.
The cenditien of the algse in the esgee at the end of the
17 dey perlod (in experiment 4) verifies the preferenecs
determined in the laboratory. Lach of the species of algae
effected could be called a "fleshy" form. A definite
relationship between the Tegula funsbralis populatien and the
marine plants in ite envirenment is certeinly indiseted.

1) Teguls funebralis vill ingest nearly any alge groving in
er out of the litteral zone. Both seeroscopie and anerusting
forms constitute importent food sources; the grenite surfeces
contsin s negligible smount of erganic detritus end contribute
littie to the diet of the anisel. Karlier wosk on I. fumebralig
and observations of I. gallina show that the animals will ingest
ergenie detritus when it is aveileble.
2) The snail profers a 'fleshy9 alga azong mecroscopie foras
(e.g. Macrocystiz int grifolie, Jereoeystis Luetkenne, and
Sigertina sapalioolete).
