et a site of organie detritus sampling. The T. funebralie
population at this leestion dvells en extremely barren rocke
and is apparently nourished by the considerable quantities of
drift seavseds thet secumulste.
The enerusting algse, partieularly the abundant green algs
and Balfeis pacifies, are undoubtedly inportant in the diet
of the animal. As Figure 1 illustrates, the width of tho
resping pattern on a glass plete thinly costed with distoms
greatly exeeeds that found en a thick Hacroeystis intsgrifelie
blade, sheving en effisient nechanies for oovering a lerge
aurfase area then necsssary: Thie may be inportant in keeping
larger algee free of diatos grovth.
Organie detritus on granite surfacee is probably enly an
sccidental food sourse at best. The detritus does contain
90 2-
digestible compounds, bowever (see Nigrelli, 1963). Tegala
gellina undeubtedly utilizes the orgenie contsnt of its candotone
substrate in s menner sisilar to Littorina planazig (Thilippi
1847) and L. seutulata (Oould 1849) as shown by North, 1934.
In esrlier work, North (umpublished data) meszured the erceite
setivitiee of T. funebralis en sandstone. Re colleeted 1.109)
ams of eroded (ingested) sandstone from the fecal seterial
of 11 sneils (total weight 58.4 grams) in 24 hours. Orgenie
detritus, as found in sandstone, may therefore be inoleded se
a foed couree of T. funebralis as vell as T. gellins, though
sendstone is not found in the Chins Point area.
