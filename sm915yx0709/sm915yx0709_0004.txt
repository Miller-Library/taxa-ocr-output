2) Feod preferense determinstien. Preferenee experimenta
vere restricted to the meerossopis elgas. Plastie diahee vere
again used in the greenbouse. Three sots of algee were effered
en alternate days to the sams animals, which had bean collestel
ene day before starting the series. The four species of
algee in each set were plased, in combinatiens of three, in the
dishes with 10 animals (range 1 to 4 grams) or 3 (range 6 te
12 grams). Wet weight differenees of the algae to the nearest
O.l gram were taken after 24 hours. Control dishes showed
ne appreeiable change in wet weight of any alga (maximum of
0.03 grams). Results are shoun in Cable II.
3) Feeding rates. Maeroexstie integrifolia blades were
selested for the feeding rate detormination because of the
sccessibility of its large blade area and its apparent appeal
to T. funebralis. Andmals collected in the field were fod M.
integrifolia for 36 hours before beginning. The wet weight of
the alge conzumed vas weasured 6 times at intervals of Ste
23 hours for a tetal of 82 hours. Two size ranges of the
snail vere again selested (3 to 5 and 7 to 9 grams) vith
four enimals in each dieh. Rezults are eenverted to graus
of the algs sonsumed per dey per gram wet weight (with shell)
ef 1. funchralis (Table III). Ihe contrel algae chowed a
naximm wet weight change of 6.02 graus.
