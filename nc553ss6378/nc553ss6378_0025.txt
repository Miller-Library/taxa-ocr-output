The highest concentrations of nitrite and phosphate, and some-
times nitrate, are observed at station 3. However, the nutrient levels
at station 6 are consistently high and the variability of each nutrient
at station 6 is often equal to, and sometimes higher than, the variability
of nutrients at station 3. It is noteworthy that the boil at station 3
seems to be the most variable of all six stations, especially in phos-
phate and nitrate concentrations.
Phosphates, which exhibit their greatest concentrations at the sur-
face of station 3, tend to show lowered concentrations as they approach
station 5. However, at station 6, though surface and mid depths still
have fairly low phosphate levels, there exists a large increase in bottom
phosphate concentrations, being almost as great as those found at the
boil (fig. 11).
There seems to be some correlation between volume of effluent be-
ing released from the pipe and levels of phosphate found (fig. 12). After
the effluent is brought up to maximum flow at 0800, phosphate rises
markedly, and as the effluent flow decreases throughout the day, phos-
phate levels gradually decrease. Phosphate levels are lowest during the
dark, precisely the same time that the volume of effluent is being dis-
charged at its minimum flow rate. This observation was made at station 3,
but at station 6 this correlation does not hold. At station 6, while the
highest phosphate levels were detected during the day, high readings (high-
er than at the boil) were found during the dark hour also. Nitrate did
not seem to bear any relationship to volume of flow as did phosphate, nor
did nitrate show any increased concentrations at any specific depth. Phos-
phate showed greatest levels at the surface of all stations.
