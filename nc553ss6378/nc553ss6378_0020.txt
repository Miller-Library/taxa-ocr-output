Figure 9. Oxygen and Hydrogen Sulfide Levels. Oxygen is
shown in p.p.m. and hydrogen sulfide in ugm.-at./1. Note
inverse relationship observed between the two parameters.
As one increases, the other decreases accordingly. Even
at points of greatest hydrogen sulfide production, oxygen
saturation never dropped below 60%. Station 5 values are
from the surface. Stations 3, 6, and 1 show bottom values.
