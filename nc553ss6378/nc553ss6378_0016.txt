Figure 7. Oxygen Levels Over 24 Hour Period for Six
Stations. Surface oxygenilevels are shown by broken
line and bottom oxygen levels are shown by solid line.
Note same basic trend for all six stations with the
greatest oxygen depletion occuring at midnight on
the bottom of all stations. High point at 0400 is
believed to be due to water turbulence on days when
sampling took place. Oxygen is shown in p.p.m.
