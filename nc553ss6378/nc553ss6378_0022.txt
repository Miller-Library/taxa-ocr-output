levels showed their greatest decrease. As oxygen levels fell throughout
the rest of the day, levels of hydrogen sulfide gradually increased.
Note that even at the point of greatest hydrogen sulfide production
(almost .3 ugm.-At. hydrogen sulfide/L. at station 6) oxygenllevels fell
to no more than to 63% saturation. Once again, there does not appear to
be a significant difference between samples taken at the different sta-
tions, regardless of the depth sampled. Both surface and bottom samples
show trends of hydrogen sulfide fluctuation throughout the day that are
inversely proportional to those trends shown by oxygen levels. However,
a slight increase in hydrogen sulfide production was observed towards the
lower depths.
Nutrients
Neither phosphate nor nitrate showed any obvious correlations with
oxygen levels as was observed with hydrogen sulfide. Nitrite, however,
though not showing strict correlations during the day, did show increased
concentrations near the bottom at station 3 and station 6, the two areas
where oxygen depletion was greatest during the night. There also exists
a rapid increase in nitrite levels at all stations from 0400-0800, again
this being the period of large decreases in oxygen levels at all six
stations (fig. 10).
Computed means and standard deviations for concentrations of ni-
trite, nitrate, and hydrogen sulfide indicate the study area as one that
has highly variable nutrient levels (fig. 8). Again, note the presence of
slightly increased concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and nitrite at the
bottom depths. Also, phosphate concentrations are relatively stable
compared to the extreme fluctuations shown by nitrate and hydrogen sulfide
and, to a lesser degree, nitrite.
