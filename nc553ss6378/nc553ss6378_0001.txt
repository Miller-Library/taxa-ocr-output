ABSTRACT
The area of Monterey Bay near the Monterey City Outfall Line
was investigated for relationships between dissolved oxygen and
nutrient levels and changes in biogeochemical cycles during a day-
night study period. Consideration was given to the production of the
toxins hydrogen sulfide and nitrite, the use of nutrients as indi-
cators of sewage pollution in the marine environment, and correla-
tions of nutrients and oxygen levels to time, depth, and proximity
to the outfall.
2. It was found that neither oxygen levels decreased enough nor did
hydrogen sulfide levels increase enough to pose immediate toxicity
to fish life during the period of study.

Levels of hydrogen sulfide, onygen, and to a lesser extent, nitrite,
are dependent upon a day-night cycle. Phosphate seems to be de-
pendent to a greater extent upon the volume of effluent being released
from the outfall. Nitrate shows no obvious correlation with either
factor.
Phosphate is found in greatest quantities at the surface. Hydrogen
sulfide and nitrite are found in slightly increased levels towards
the bottom depths. Nitrate does not show any obvious gradients
with depth.
Stability of phosphate seems to make it a better indicator of
effluent flow direction and rate than the other nutrients studied.
Using phosphate as an indicator, it is suggested that much of the
effluent of the Monterey City Outfall is flowing southward and pool
ing in a deadwater area near the Monterey Wharf No. 2, enriching
the area considerably.
