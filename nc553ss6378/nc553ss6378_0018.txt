Figure 8. Means and Standard Deviations. Means
are computed from all values of a parameter over
24 hour period. Deviations show variability of
that parameter over same time period. Note in-
creased variability around stations 3 and 6.
Also note highest values around these stations.
Nitrate, hydrogen sulfide,aand nitrite are all
quite variable compared to the more stable (smal
deviations) phosphate. Oxygen is measured in
ppm, nitrate in ugm.-at. N/1., nitrite also in
ugm.-at.N/1., phosphate in.ugm.-at. P/1., and
hydrogen sulfide in ugm.-at. HoS/1.
