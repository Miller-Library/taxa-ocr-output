Figure 12. Phosphate Levels, Nitrate Levels, and
Volume of Effluent from Monterey Outfall. Flow of
effluent is measured in millions of gallons/day.
Phosphate and nitrate are measured in ugm.-at. P/1.
and ugm.-at. N/1. respectively. Note increase of
phosphate in morning, gradual decrease throughout
day, and low concentrations at night. No apparent
pattern is followed by nitrate. Surface phosphates
(thick black line) seem to be greater than either
mid (broken line) or bottom depth (thin black
line) values. No correlations seem to exist for
nitrate.
