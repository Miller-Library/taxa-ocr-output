RESUET
Oxygen
Throughout the 24 hour period sampled, levels of oxygen appeared
to show similar trends at all six stations (fig. 7). In each case, ox-
ygen reductions occurred just before sunrise (0400-0800). Oxygen levels
then increased during the daylight hours until around 1600, at which
point they begin to drop off again. They continued to drop throughout
the night until midnight. The low point at midnight was then followed
by an increase with a high point at 0400.
Note that differences in dissolved oxygen between surface and
bottom samples were not terribly large, although the bottom samples at
all stations were more oxygen-depleted from 1600 to midnight. It is
significant that the degree of oxygen variation (fig. 8) for a 24 hour
period at station 3 is not decidely different from variations of ogygen
levels at any other station during the same period. However, the lowest
reading for oxygen of the entire survey (4.7 ppm) was observed at 2400
on the bottom of station 3. Only twice did dissolved ogygen levels at the
surface drop below 6 ppm, and while bottom levels dropped below 6 ppm
seven times, only once did they drop below 5 ppm. At no time did any
station, at any depth sampled, have less than 50% oxygen saturation of the
water.
ydrogen Sulfide
Varying amounts of hydrogen sulfide were found and for the most
part appeared to bear a definite inverse relationship to levels of ox
ygen at the depths sampled (fig. 9). The highest increases in hydrogen
sulfide were observed from 040.080, which is the same time thet ovygen
