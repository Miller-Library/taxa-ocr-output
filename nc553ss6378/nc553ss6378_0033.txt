Stevenson (1964) uho concluded that there exists water movement in the
upper 15 feet from the boil forty-five degrees to the south a greater
proportion of the time than in any other direction. There exists no
seaward movement. Trumbauer (1966) found a slight increase in coliform
bacteria towards the Wharf from the boil. Sherman (1970) believes that
the Monterey effluent is the source of increased numbers of Proteus
vulgaris which he found near the Wharf.
I do not doubt that the fish companies and restaurants contribute
to the large nutrient levels near the Wharf, but I cannot believe that
these sources could raise nutrient concentrations to the levels noted in
this stuch,
Because nutrient concentrations at the Wharf approach those found
within 50 yards of the boil and because the works cited indicated a
southerly water movement from the Monterey Outfall, I believe that
phosphate concentrations can be used as an indicator of effluent flow
from the Monterey Outfall Pipe southward to the Monterey Wharf No. 2.
There the effluent seems to pool and cause this area to be one of rela-
tively high enrichment and pollution compared to other areas along Del
Monte Beach.
While it has been shown that neither oxygen decreases nor hydrogen
sulfide increases reach levels sufficient to immediately poison fish, it
is not known what effects the large increases in nutrients can have on
organisms, especially as found at the Monterey Outfall and around the
Monterey Wharf. Water movement south from the boil has caused an en-
richment of water adjacent to the Wharf not much different from that seen
around the outfall
