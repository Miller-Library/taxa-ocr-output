Stations 4 and 5 are located 400 and 800 yards, respectively, south
of station 3.
Station 6 is about 500 yards south of station 5 and 100 yards
north of the Monterey Commercial Wharf No. 2.
Beginning at station 3 and extending south to station 6 the water
tends to be a bit more gcalm as the area becomes increasingly protected
from wave action. Accordingly, on rough days when stations 1 and 2 could
not be approached, stations 3-6 could be easily sampled.
Water samples at three depths for each of the six stations were
taken at a single time on each of eleven days. Sampling was scheduled
to include two days at each of the following times: 0400, 0800, 1200,
1600, and 2400 hours. Only one series of samples was taken at 2000 hours.
From aboard ship, water samples were taken by reversing Nansen bottles
at the surface (0-2 feet), at mid (12-17 feet), and at bottom (20-30
feet) depths for analysis of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Temp-
erature and depth were both recorded by means of a Martek TDC Probe
(Martek Instruments, Inc.). Figure 6 shows the sample stations, fre-
quency of sampling, and water temperatures for each depth at each station.
Until 20 May, 1970, dissolved oxygen at the three depths was deter-
mined by the Winkler Method (Strickland and Parsons, 1969). After this
date, a Martek Oxygen Probe was used. Oxygen samples for Winkler
analysis were fixed on board ship in 300 ml glass BOD bottles and anal-
yzed within 24 hours in the laboratory. Water samples were also analyzed
for phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide. Nutrient samples
were taken in 250 ml plastic bottles and frozen 24-48 hours. Analysis
began after a thawing period of one to two hours. All nutrient analyses
were done according to the methods outlined in Strickland and Parsons (1969),
