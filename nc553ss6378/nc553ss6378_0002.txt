INTRODUCTION
Virtually all the work so far reported concerning the effects-of
sewage pollution on the marine environment has been based on studies
made during daylight hours. There is little information concerning nu¬
trient and oxygen levels or fluctuations of biogeochemical cycles and
environmental factors at night. This paper is devoted to an investiga-
tion of the possible nighttime changes which might take place of oxygen
and nutrient levels around a primary sewage outfall and to relate these
to fluctuations in certain biogeochemical cycles as well as to depth,
time, and proximity to the outfall.
Of particular interest is the sulphur cycle which involves the
breakdown of organic matter containing sulphur compounds (amino acids)
to hydrogen sulfide, then to sulphur, and finally to sulfate, which can
then be recycled by plants. This process is dependent upon the presence
of aerobic conditions (fig. 1). If, however, the oxygen level is suf-
ficiently lowered, then anaerobic bacteria such as Desulfavibrio can con¬
vert the sulfate directly to hydrogen sulfide, an extremely toxic sub-
stance. Hydrogen sulfide occurs normally in bottom sediments where or-
ganic matter is plentiful and anaerobic conditions exist. In times of
upwelling and turbulence, when quantities of hydrogen sulfide are brought
to the surface, massive fish kills can take place (Theede, 1968). Kor-
mandy (1966) has made the same observations in areas polluted by the
effluents of pulp mills. As the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in-
creases, total biomass decreases proportionally. Theede (1968) further
believes that organisms with greater mobility are much more sensitive to
hydrogen sulfide poisoning than less mobile organisms, since the toxin
