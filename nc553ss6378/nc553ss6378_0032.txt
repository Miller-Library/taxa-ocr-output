Throughout most of the day, nitrite concentrations increase probab-
ly as a result of the aerobic breakdown of ammonia. But early in the
morning after 0400, increases in nitrite could well be connected to the
dropping oxygen levels which allow production of nitrite from nitrate
under anaerobic conditions. Highest nitrite levels at the bottoms of
stations 3 and 6 perhaps reflect the lower oxygen levels found at these
stations, especially at night. While hydrogen sulfide seems closely
correlated with oxygen levels, nitrite seems to be a bit less so, cor-
responding inversely with oxygen only in the hours between 0400 and 0800.
Nitrite seems to be produced under anaerobic conditions from nitrate
and under aerobic conditions from ammonia whereas hydrogen sulfide levels
found were probably all produced under anaerobic conditions from sulfate.
The obvious relative stability of phosphate could mean that it may
act as a good indicator of sewage pollution. Nitrate and hydrogen sulfide
are too variable, and nitrite is not found in large enough quantities to
act as an easily detectable indicator. Because of its close correlation
with the volume of effluent leaving the pipe, phosphate may be used to
possibly tell how much effluent is being dispersed and at what rate. Phos-
phate seems to be more dependent upon effluent volume rather than on
oxygen levels or any day-night cycle, as is hydrogen sulfide and, to a
lesser degree, nitrite.
If this is the case, then the phosphate gradient existing from sta-
tion 3 to station 6 could indicate that the effluent is moving southward
towards Nonterey Wharf No. 2 where it slows and particulate nutrients
settle to the bottom as the effluent "pools" in this seemingly deadwater
area. The high levels and high degrees of variability shown by all nu-
trients at station 6 support this idea. Further evidence is given by
