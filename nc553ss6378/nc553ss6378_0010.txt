Figure 4. The Area of Study. Six stations were
set up in the 3.5 mile area that runs from the
Monterey Commercial Wharf No. 2 north to the Fort
Ord Firing Line. The stations were sampled 800
from shore. Note the Monterey City Outfall Line
which extends offshore 800 feet and the Saaside
City Outfall Line offshore about 300 feet. Wind
was always from the West.
