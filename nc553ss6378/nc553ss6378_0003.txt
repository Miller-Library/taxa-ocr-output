acts as an inhibitor of respiration. Thus, fish are usually more effect-
ed by hydrogen sulfide than are most invertebrates.
In aereated sewage systems, most hydrogen sulfide is broken down to
sulphur because of the aerobic conditions. There exists, however, the
possibility that around an outfall area substantial oxygen depletion
could occur by aerobic bacteria breaking down accumulated organic matter
in the effluent. This situation might become extreme during night hours
when there is no photosynthesis to replenish the oxygen used up by the
aerobic bacteria. This oxygen reduction might lead to anaerobic condi¬
tions sufficient to allow production of hydrogen sulfide in amounts cap¬
able of poisoning fish in the area. Processes occuring at night could
then lead to toxin production that would go relatively unnoticed when
sampling only during the daytime.
In a similar fashion, nitrate can be anaerobically converted by
denitrifying bacteria to the toxic nitrite phase (fig. 2). Nighttime
conditions could also bring about changes in the nitrogen cycle that
would not be noticed when samples were taken only during the day.
This work will deal with relationships between oxygen and nutrient
levels near the marine outfall of Monterey, California, with special
consideration given to the production of both these toxins, hydrogen
sulfide and nitrite, as related to changes in their respective biogeo¬
chemical cycles which could be caused by the presence of primary effluent.
Finally, the validity of using nutrient levels as indicators of
pollution and their relationships to time, depth, and proximity to the
outfall will be considered.
