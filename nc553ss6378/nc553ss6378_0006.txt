METHODS AND MATERIALS
The area studied is at the southern end of Monterey Bay, Californ-
ia. It extends from the Monterey Commercial Wharf No. 2, approximately
3.5 miles northward to just south of the Fort Ord Firing Line (fig. 3).
Within this area six stations were set up parallel to the long
sandy Del Monte Beach Area, each station being about 800 feet offshore
(fig. 4). The underlying bottom is mostly sandy, with a bed of shale
occuring just south of station 3 and extending southward towards the
wharf (Dorman, 1968). Between stations 3 and 6 there exists a large
bed of the kelp Macrocystis integrifolia. The average depth of the
stations is 30-40 feet for stations 1-5 and 20-25 feet for station 6.
Station 1 is just south of the Fort Ord Firing Line offshore from
a large sand and gravel company that is removing sediment from up to
100 feet offshore.
Station 2 is opposite the outfall for the city of Seaside, about
one mile south of station 1. Because the outfall line extends only 300
feet from shore, it was impossible to get close enough to take samples
at the boil due to the heavy surf action frequently encountered in the
area.
Station 3 is at the boil of the Monterey City Outfall Pipe, one mile
south of station 2. The outfall line extends 800 feet from the shore
into Monterey Bay and releases about 217 million gallons per day of pri-
mary treated sewage at a point 18 feet below the surface of the water. The
boil can usually be detected from sea by the strong odor of chlorine, the
water discoloration, and the relative smoothness of the water at the
point where the effluent reaches the surface (fig. 5).
