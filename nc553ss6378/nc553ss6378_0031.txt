of hydrogen sulfide produced are fairly low at all the stations sam-
pled. The reason for the low levels of hydrogen sulfide could be
1.) high oxygen levels which prevent the anaerobic processes from taking
place to any marked degree, 2.) chlorination of the sewage at the treat-
ment plant which breaks down hydrogen sulfide in the following way:
8 t C1â€”HCl 8
and 3.) a scarcity of sulfur-containing compounds in the effluent itself
It seems that most of the hydrogen sulfide is broken doun by the
time it emerges from the pipe and that increases found were probably due
primarily to anaerobic conversion of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide in the
marine environment. These increases do not seem to be large enough, how-
ever, to cause immediate poisoning to the marine fish in the area. But
because this toxin was not found in great quantities in the water does
not mean that hydrogen sulfide is absent from the area. For example, in
1951-1952, the Terminal Island Outfall in Los Angeles Harbor put out
around 6 million gallons of primary treated sewage daily and oxygen levels
were never reported below 4-5 ppm (Reisch, 1959). Though obvious quan-
tities of hydrogen sulfide were not found in the water around the outfall
Reisch believed that there were large amounts of sulfide in the sediments
beneath the pipe, where conditions were more anaerobic. It is conceivable
that in any period of extreme turbulence these toxin-containing sediments
beneath the pipe could be stirred up, especially if the pipe is in rela-
tively shallow water, and the poisons dispersed. It seems clear that
dissolved oxygen levels are not always good indicators of what is happen-
ing in the substrate in an area effected by an outfall. Sediments beneath
Monterey Outfall could contain considerable quantities of hydrogen sulfide
not necessarily detectable in the vater.
