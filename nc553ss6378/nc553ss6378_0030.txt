CONCLUSTON
Throughout the night hours a general drop in oxygen levels did
occur at all stations, presumably due to the inability of plants and
phytoplankton to photosynthesize and produce oxygen. The maximum level
of dissolved oxygen was observed at 0400 at all stations and could be
due to turbulence of the water on the specific days sampled. It has been
reported that in lakes, the presence of waves, and whitecaps can increase
the oxygen content of the water by 10 to 100 times, allowing increased
absorption of oxygen from the air (Imhoff, 1966).
Even on the bottom around the outfall the oxygen level rarely drop
ped below 5 ppm, regardless of the day or time of day. Though most ma-
rine fish can tolerate oxygen drops down to 3 ppm, they prefer at least
a minimum of 5 ppm (Martin, 1968). However, it has been found that some
species of marine fish can suffer up to a 25% decrease in optimum repro-
duction when living in water at 4 ppm (Martin, 1968). Imhoff (1966)
further reports that some states on the East Coast, including New York,
recommend that dissolved oxygen levels never fall below 50% saturation
for purposes of bathing, fishing, and shellfish culturing. At no time
and at no station in our survey did the oxygen level drop below 50%
saturation, and seldom did it drop below 65-70% saturation. It seems that
even at the boil there does not exist any immediate danger to fish life in
terms of dissolved oxygen content of the surrounding waters, at least
within the time period studied.
The evidence found indicates that levels of hydrogen sulfide are
closely related to levels of dissolved oxygen. The portion of the sul-
fur cycle which involves the anaerobic conversion of sulfate to hydrogen
sulfide could indeed be taking place in the study area, yet the levels
