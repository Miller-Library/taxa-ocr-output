As shown in Figure 8, addition on Zn even at very low levels of
Ca was somewhat effective in inducing acrosome reactions. The data
presented suggests that there may be a heavy metal factor, perhaps a
Zn factor, involved in the mechanism governing the acrosome reaction.
A possible mode of action would be for Zn' to alter the sperm plasma
membrane permeability to Ca+2. The following explanation suggests
a mechanism by which Zn may act to initiate an acrosome reaction.
It is conceivable that there are certain Zn'- specific enzymes such
as histidine or another amino acid residue bound in the sperm plasma
membrane. When these enzymes or metalloproteins bind to Zn or less
strongly to other heavy metals, the structure along the entire protein
is altered creating a "hole" through which Ca' influx may occur.
Selectivity for Zn or other heavy metals over the more prevalent
Ca' ions can be explained by their respective electron configurations.
Zn' has a filled "d" shell and an empty "s'" shell making it
readily availabel to form covalent bonds with uncharged molecules such
as the amino acid residues of proteins. Ca takes on a noble
gas configuration and binds mainly to charged ligands (Gilly, in press
1982). The result is that Zn" is selected over Ca' and binds to
histidine or another amino acid residue in the sperm plasma membrane
thus forming an imidazole bond which exhibits great flexiblilty.
(Freeman, 1973). The structure along the entire protein is altered
in such a way that the membrane becomes permeable to Ca. Through
such a mechanism the presence of Zn' or perhaps other heavy metals
may be correlated triggering of the acrosome reaction.
