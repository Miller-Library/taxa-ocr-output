Results and Discussion
Morphology of the Acrosome Reaction.
Sperm of T. funebralis follows a similar sequence of events as
that described for sea urchin sperm. Figures 1, 2, and 3, show
electron micrographs of T. funebralis sperm during the acrosome
reaction. In the sea urchin sperm, triggering of the acrosome
reaction results in fusion of the sperm plasma membrane with acro¬
somal membrane, exocytosis of the acrosomal granule, polymerization
of globular actin in the periacrosomal region and the extension of the
acrosomal filament (Shapiro, et al, 1980). At the point of filament
extension the sperm is considered to be acrosome reacted.
Spontaneous Acrosome Reaction.
Sperm suspended in artificial sea water at pH 8 will undergo
a spontaneous acrosome reaction over time. (Fig 4). In order to
measure accurately the effects of acrosome reaction inducers the
spontaneous triggering must be eliminated. Inhibition of spontaneous
activity was achieved in solutions at pH 7.6 as well as in 10 - mM
EDTA at pH 8.0. Inhibitory effects were found to be effective in 85%
of sperm scored over a period of 30 minutes (Fig. 4).
Varying Ca Concentrations
The effects of varying Ca concentrations at pH 7.6 (Fig 5)
reveal that the acrosome reaction may be induced with high extra¬
cellular Ca levels. Inhibition at the sea water Ca - level (10mM)
is overcome by concentrations of 20mM and greater. These results
further the hypothesis that Ca influx is correlated with triggering
of the acrosome reaction.
Effects of Heavy Metals.
Work done by Tyler (1953) with sea urchin sperm showed that
heavy metal chelators would prolong the life of sperm as much as 100-fold.
