Figure 1. Electron micrograph of T. funebralis sperm before undergoing
acrosome reaction. Sperm measures approximately lu at the base and
7u in length excluding flagella. Sperm morphology: flagella (f);
mitochondria (M), nucleus (n), periacrosomal region containing
actin(pa) and acrosomal granule (ag).
Figure 2. Electron micrograph of T. funebralis sperm partially reacted.
Exocytosis has begun, contents of the acrosomal granule are about
to be exposed. Tail not visible due to fixation.
Figure3. Electron micrograph of a reacted or "blunt" sperm.
The acrosomal filament and tail were destroyed in fixation.
Figure 4. Sperm undergoes a spontaneous acrosome reaction in
pH 8.1 sea water over time. The effects of inhibition with .1
mM EDTA at pH 8.0 and with pH 7.6 artificial sea water are
shown.
Figure 5. Effects of increased Cay concentration are shown. Normal
sea water concentration of Ca is about lOmM.
Figure 6. Effegts of Zn and Sn' at normally inhibitory pH 7.6.
At luM Zn concentration 62% of spermghad undergone an acrosome
reaction. A control without added Zn exhibited a 14% acrosome
reaction.
Figure 7. Effects of luM Zn' concentrations at various Ca
concentrations. The highest percentage of acrogome reactions
was seen to occur at levels of 50mM to LOOmM Ca
Figure 8, Effejts of luM Zn at low levels of Ca Ljas compared
with a Ca control without Zn. As shown, Zn induces an
acrosome even at low levels of Ca
Figure 9. Effects of Addition of Cyclic AMP to pH 7.6 ASW.
