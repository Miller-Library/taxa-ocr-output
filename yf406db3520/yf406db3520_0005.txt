Materials and Methods
Tegula funebralis were collected in the intertidal zone at
Mussel Point, California during the months of April and May. Snails
were kept in running sea water at 13°C and used within 24 hours of
collection. To obtain sperm, the shells were cracked in a vise,
exposing the gonads. The testis were then dissected away from ad¬
jacent hepatopancreas. Sperm was isolated from the testis using a
drawn out Pasteur pipette and then transferred to a small plastic
vial. Concentrated sperm was kept on ice for up to four hours after
which fresh sperm was obtained.
Experiments were carried out by diluting 4-5 ul of sperm in
test tubes containing 1 ml of solution. Diluted sperm was thoroughly
mixed and 5 ul drops were then placed on slides at given time inter¬
vals and covered with cover slips. Acrosomal activity was assessed
by viewing sperm under phase contrast oil immersion at 1000X. Scoring
of the acrosome reaction was done using an ocular grid divided into
25 squares. Sperm were scored as being either reacted, partially
reacted, or non-reacted. "Blunt" sperm described by Johnson (1981),
were counted as reacted. (See Fig. 1, 2, and 3.). In initial ex¬
periments 500 sperm were counted in order to assess accuracy. Five
counts of 100 sperm revealed an accuracy within 5%. Therefore results
form experiments reported here were all based on counts of 100 sperm.
All solutions were prepared using five part artificial sea water:
120 mM NaCl, 10mM KCl, 10mM Cacl,, 60mM MgCl,, and 2mM NaHCO,. Tris
buffer was used to bring solutions to proper pH. Experiments were
carried out at pH 7.6 and at 25°C unless otherwise noted.
