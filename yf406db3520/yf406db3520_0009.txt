induces an acrosome reaction is not clear. As shown in Figure 9,
addition of cAMP, especially at 10 uM concentrations proved effective
in inducing an acrosome reaction in 53% of sperm. The means by which
cAMp is transperted across the sperm plasma membrane, if indeed it is,
remains a puzzle. The mechanism by which an intracellular increase in
cAMP acts in relationship to the acrosome reaction has been studied in
sea urchin sperm. (Kopf and Garbers, 1980). These results are dis¬
cussed in the following proposed mechanism for governing of the
acrosome reaction in T. funebralis.
Based on data presented here and on previous findings in the
study of acrosome reactions, the following hypothesis is suggested
for a mechanism by which the acrosome reaction might occur.
Upon contact with egg jelly components similar to those presented
by Kopf and Garbers (1980), the sperm plasma membrane permeability to
Ca ions is increased. This step may also be potentiated by presence
of Zn'. The increase in intracellular Ca activates sperm adenylate
cyclase levels which leads to elevation of sperm cAMP concentrations.
The result is an activation of a cAMP-dependant protein kinase and
subsequent phosphorylation of membrane proteins which could then allow
for further Ca influx, also potentiated by Zn. The end result is
the triggering and actual process of the acrosome reaction.
This hypothesis is in agreement with findings by Levine and Walsh
(1979) suggesting that protease activation occurs prior to any morphe¬
logical changes characterizing the acrosome reaction. It is conceivable
then that a correlation exists between the presence of Zn, Ca per¬
meability increase in sperm plasma membrane, and increased levels of
cAMP in the triggering of the acrosome reaction.
