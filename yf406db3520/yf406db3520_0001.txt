Abstract
The acrosome reaction in sperm is an essential requirement for
fertilization. This involves several interrelated changes in
sperm plasma membrane permeability to Ca', Na', H', and K ions.
The mechanism by which the acrosome reaction occurs was studied
in the marine snail Tegula funetralis and an attempt to define
the conditions surrounding the acrosome reaction was made using
various inhibitors and inducers of the acrosome reaction. In¬
hibition of the acrosome reaction was achieved in both pH 7.6
artificial sea water and in 10 * mM EDTA in pH 8 artificial sea
water. Inhibition was effective in 85% of the sperm evaluated.
Several inducers were effective at normally inhibitory pH 7.6.
It should be noted that a 100% acrosomal reaction was never achieved
due to a mixture of mature and immature sperm. Ca in concen¬
trations ranging from 20mM to 100mM induced acrosome reactions in
48% of sperm after a period of 10 minutes. Heavy metals such as
Zn and Sn were found effective in inducing acrosome reaction in
concentrations ranging from .1 uM to 100 uM. In particular it
was found that at luM concentrations, Zn was most effective in
that 62% of sperm had undergone acrosome reactions after ten minutes. The
most dramatic results were achieved with a combination of solutions
containing 20mM to 100mM Ca and luM Zn'. Under these conditions
73% of sperm had undergone an acrosome reaction after 10 minutes.
cAMP was effective in concentrations from.luM to 10mM, the highest
percent of acrosome reactions occuring at lOuM concentrations (55%).
The results presented here and data from previous work
done on
the mechanism governing acrosome raaction indicate that Ca, Zn.
and cAMP may be involved in the mechniam which triggers and/or mediates
the acrosome reaction in T. funebralis
