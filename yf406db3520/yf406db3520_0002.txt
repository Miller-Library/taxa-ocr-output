Introduction
In order for fertilization to occur several changes in gamete
surfaces must take place. One of these alterations, the acrosome
reaction in sperm involves an alteration in sperm plasma membrane
permeability to specific ions. The result is a transformation in
morphology and subsequent activation of the sperm necessary for
fertilization.
The conditions under which the acrosome reaction occurs have
been studied extensively in the sperm of the sea urchin, Stronglylo¬
centrotus purpuratus and is believed to be elicited by contact with
components in the jelly surrounding the outer surface of the egg.
(Shapiro, 1980). Upon contact with the egg jelly, sea urchin sperm
undergoes a morphological change characterized by membrane fusion,
exocytosis, and extension of the acrosomal filament. (Shapiro, 1980).
As in the sea urchin, fertilization in the snail, Tegula fune-
bralis takes place externally with seasonal spawning of gametes. The
eggs are surrounded by a jelly layer and the spermatozoa are rela¬
tively large with a well formed acrosome thus facilitating assessment
of the acrosome reaction under phase contrast microscopy. Although
the conditions under which the acrosome reaction in T. funebralis
occurs have not been determined, it seems reasonable to assume that
the acrosome reaction takes place near the egg and is affected by a
component or components contained in the egg or egg jelly. Studies
of an egg membrane lysin released by sperm have been made on several
species of Tegula (Haino and Kigawa) and the lysin was found to be
released after contact with the outer surface of the egg. The mechan¬
ism by which the lysin is released is still under investigation and
