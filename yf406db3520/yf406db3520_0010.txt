Acknowledgements
I owe a very special thanks to Dr. Don Abbott for kicking
me in the rear and encouraging me to finish this paper in time
for graduation. Many thanks to Dr. Epel for putting up with my
antics and especially for all the help and guidance given me
throughout the quarter. Without the help of Dr. Dave Clapper in
writing this paper I would have been lost and I thank him for all
the time he put in. Thanks to Chris Patton for the pictures, and
to "Joe" Gilly for all he has done in helping me. Special thanks
to Willy and Chris for taking me trout fishing so I could come back
and write this paper with a clear mind.
