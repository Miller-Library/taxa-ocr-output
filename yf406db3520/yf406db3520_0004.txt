Increasing K levels from 10 mM to 20mM has been shown to
prevent acrosome reaction in sea urchin sperm (Shapiro, 1980). He
suggests then that K movement is also involved in the acrosome reaction.
Later studies by Shapiro indicate that K' efflux occurs after the
acrosome reaction is completed and thus is not directly involved in
the triggering mechanism.
The effect of cyclic nucleotides on acrosome reaction has been
studied in sea urchins using a factor isolated from the jelly layer
surrounding the egg. (Kopf and Garbers, 1980). They have suggested
that activation of the sperm adenylate cyclase is mediated by Ca
influx. This activation of adenylate cyclase then causes an elevation
in intracellular cAMP concentrations which in turn leads to activation
of a protein kinase. The subsequent phosphorylation of membrane
proteins may have an effect on the acrosome reaction. (Kopf and Garbers.
1980).
The present paper investigates the conditions surrounding the
acrosome reaction including alterations in ion permeability and
cyclic nucleotide effects. Particular emphasis is placed on the
mechanism governing the initial Ca influx and its' relationship
with Zn and cAMP.
