Iyler concluded that these chelating agents worked by chelating the
heavy metals present in sea water. Later work done by Johnson (1981)
using EDTA and cysteine gave similar results in prolonging motility
and fertilization potential in sea urchin sperm. Johnson has pos¬
tulated that the inhibitory action of chelators is likely to take
effect on the sperm surface rather than intracellularly. This
theory suggests that the addition of heavy metals should induce and ac¬
rosome reaction.
The effects of adding Zn and Sn' in concentrations ranging
from 0.1 uM to lOuM are shown in Figure 6. The most dramatic effect
Sn showed a similar effect yet not
was achieved with luM Zn.
as dramatic as the Zn effect. Addition of 1 uM Zn' proved to
be particularly interesting and warranted further experimentation.
Additionally, .luM amounts of Zn' acted to increase the number of
sperm acrosome reacted by a margin of 26 % after 10 minutes. Sea water
concentrations of Zn' were found to be between .1 uM and .3 uM along
the Pacific Coast (Potts and Todd, 1965). As seen in Figure 6,
a luM concentration of Zn' effected a 43% increase in the number of
acrosome reactions.
Triggering of the acrosome reaction in sea urchins appears to be
especially sensitive to Zn concentrations; an increase in concen¬
tration to 10"Mor greater has an inhibitory effect (Johnson, 1981).
Similarly in T. funebralis Zn concentrations above 10 M are
not nearly as effective in inducing an acrosome reaction as are lower
concentrations.
These results indicate a correlation between heavy metals and
triggering of the acrosome reaction. Further experiments tested the
effects of luM Zn at various Ca levels from .lmM to 100 mM. (Fig.7)
