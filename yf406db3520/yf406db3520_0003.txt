it remains to be seen whether this is an acrosomal enzyme. Assuming
that its release is somehow dependant on the acrosome reaction it can
be shown that there is a correlation between contact with egg jelly and
the mechanism governing the acrosome reaction.
Like many other excitable cells, sperm responds to changes in
specific ion gradients through altered permeability of the sperm
plasma membrane (Shapiro,1980). More specifically he has shown that
induction of the acrosome reaction corresponds to changes in sperm
plasma membrane permeability to Ca, H, K, and Na.
It was first shown by Dan (1954) that extracellular Ca was
an essential requirement for the acrosome reaction in sea urchin
sperm. Upon triggering of the acrosome reaction there is an influx
of Ca ions which accumulate in the mitochondria (Cantino, unpublished
data). The mechanism by which this Ca'" influx occurs is not clear.
Epel (1977) showed that an ionophore A23187 which allows for Ca
uptake triggers the acrosome reaction in sea urchin sperm thus it is
postulated that Ca influx is an initial step in the mechanism
governing the acrosome reaction. Data suggest that there is a close
relationship between the acrosome reaction and the increase in sperm
plasma membrane permeability to Ca ions. (Shapiro, et.al.).
In addition to Ca' influx there are other ionic movements
associated with the acrosome reaction. In sea urchin sperm it has
been shown that when the acrosome reaction is triggered there is an
uptake of Na and concurrent efflux of H' ions into the extraÂ¬
cellular solution. It is suggested that the Na :H exchange is in
some way essential to the acrosome reaction. (Schackmann, unpublished
data). Of particular interest he has shown that a Ca  requiring step
preceeds the Na :H exchange thus indicating that a Ca " dependant
step is an initial step in the triggering of the acrosome reaction.
