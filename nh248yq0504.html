Introduction
In light of the recent concern over contamination and toxicity of
cadmium (Nilsson, 1969), (Schroeder, et al, 1966, 1967, 1968), (Pringle, 1968),
an examination of cadmium, zinc, copper, and manganese concentrations in the
edible portions of bivalve mollusks, 10 species of fish, and 3 species of
crustaceans was undertaken. Particular attention was given to the soft
bodies and organs of the mollusks since other workers have reported that
they concentrate trace metals (Schroeder, 1967), (Brooks and Rumsby, 1965),
(Pringle, 1968).
Six species of mollusks and 2 species of fish were collected from
Elkhorn Slough, which flows into Monterey Bay near Moss Landing, California.
This area is particularly abundant in estuarine animals although it has
been condemned by the county health department as a health hazard due to
high E.coli counts. It is also the receptor of both the Pacific Gas & Electric
generator plant and the Kaiser Aluminum plant waste water effluents. No
attempt was made to determine the metal contents of the effluents. Accord-
ing to Veith (1971), Monterey Bay sewage effluents pour as much as 175 grams
of cadmium into the Bay per day.
Methods
Mollusks were collected and removed from shells, rinsed with dis-
tilled water and disected (where applicable). Fish and crustacean samples were
purchased at local fish markets. All samples were weighed, dried for about
12 hours at 1000C and reweighed. Digestion of dried material was accomplished
55.

by adding 90% nitric acid and heating in acid-cleaned 30ml Pyrex beakers.
Drops of capryl alcohol were added to minimize foaming where necessary,
(as in Middleton and Stuckey, 1953). Blanks were treated exactly as the
marine samples. Once the tissues were in solution, they were heated until
charred, on hot plates, in order to burn off lipid particles. Samples
were cooled, redisolved with 90% nitric acid, and cleared by adding
hydrogen peroxide dropwise with heat. Once clear, samples were diluted with
distilled water, covered, and analyzed within 3 days. Samples were analyzed
for metal concentrations by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 303),
using a triple slot burner head. The detection limits for cadmium, copper,
and manganese were 0.05 ug/g dry weight, and for zinc was 0.5 ug/g dry weight.
Results & Discussion
Tables of the results indicate the common and scientific names of
samples, which samples were disected, and which samples were analyzed whole
(since they are eaten whole). The right hand column of the tables lists the
dry to wet weight ratio. Multiplication of this value by the dry parts per
million (ppm or ug/g) figures gives the values for ppm wet weight.
Metals were clearly concentrated in bivalve mollusks of all species.
The highest concentrations were found in the heart, gills and visceral mass
of individual animals. The clams tended to concentrated the metals to a
lesser degree than did the non-siphoned bivalves, i.e. the scallop, oysters,
and mussels, in every case except for the Bent-nosed clams. Three Bent-nosed
clams <span style='background-color:grey' title='Macoma nasuta : Fuzzy'>(Nacoma nasuta)</span> from Elkhorn Slough averaged 30 ppm dry weight of cadmium
and 1,076 ppm dry weight of zinc (See Table 1). This particularly hardy
species of clam has a separated siphon which acts as a "vacuum cleaner"
combing the surface of the slough bottom.
Whole oysters, and especially Ostrea lurida from San Francisco Bay,
were noted to have high concentrations of zinc (900 ppm dry) and copper
(173 ppm dry) (See Table 2). The nephridium of one scallop <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hinnites multirugosus : Exact'>(Hinnites multi-
rugosus)</span> taken from San Pedro Harbor in Los Angeles, contained the highest
cadmium level of the study (181 ppm dry) (See Table 4). Interestingly enough,
the nephridium corresponds in function to the mammalian kidneys, which are
also the site of cadmium concentration (Schroeder, 1967).
Although the Gaper clams <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tresus nuttalli : Exact'>(Tresus nuttalli)</span> from Elkhorn Slough, had
low metal concentrations, the outer skin, covering the neck was found to
have the highest manganese content (1,200 ppm dry) (See Table 5). Since
manganese is a common metal component of sediments, it is possible that
the sample of neck skin included some clay particles, although it was thor-
oughly washed. Unfortunately a substrate analysis of the Slough sediment was
not taken.
Although cadmium values in fish flesh were relatively low,(less than
1.5 ppm dry) Swordfish and Salmon contained more cadmium than the crustaceans
and edible portions of the Gaper clam (Table 6).
The figures presented here should not be considered as representitive for
species from the entire Pacific Coast. Note, for example, that the cadmium
concentration was 5 times higher in Littleneck clams (Protothaca staminea)
from Elkhorn Slough than those from Canada (See Table 1).
54
According to Schroeder, a normal human intake of cadmium is 215 ug/ day
(Nilsson, 1969). Of this, 984 is excreted. Of the 24 retained, most is stored
in the kidneys and liver. Bowen (1966) indicated that 3mg of cadmium ingested
per day is "toxic" to humans. In order to achieve such an intake of cadmium
per day, one would have to eat 1½ pounds of Bent-nosed clams or 17 whole
oysters from Elkhorn Slough. Likewise, 84 pounds of scallop muscles from
San Pedro Harbor, or 174 pounds of Swordfish steak would account for such
a quantity of cadmium. (These amounts were calculated from the cadmium
concentrations in ppm wet weight.)

Legend for Graph 1
The following bar graph represents cadmium concentrations in
weight of edible samples. In the cases where the whole animal (shell-less)
is eaten, such as the smaller clams and oysters, whole body concentrations
are depicted. Samples listed as "ND" are the cleaned edible portions in
which the metal concentration was below the detection limit.
Tables i through 7 list the genus species names of the animals examined
along with the ppm dry weight values and the dry/wet weight ratios.
