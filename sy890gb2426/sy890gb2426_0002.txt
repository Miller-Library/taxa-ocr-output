Introduction
Blood chemistry and hematology are commonly used as an indicator of health and
physiological status. However, the accurate interpretation of blood parameters relies on
the assumption that sampling procedure does not affect resting values (Houston, 1990).
At the Tuna Research and Conservation Center (TRCC), we are interested in determining
baseline values for captive yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) blood hematology and
chemistry without injuring or stressing the fish.
The effects of handling stress and muscle activity on fish blood chemistry and
hematology are well documented. In rainbow trout, handling stress causes increased
hematocrit and disruption of ionic balance leading to increased potassium and decreased
chloride levels in the blood (Railo, E. et al). The stress response involves, in particular, an
adrenaline mediated release of red blood cells from the spleen into circulation (McDonald
and Milligan, 1992). Yamamoto et al. (1980) showed an increase in red blood cells in
circulation as measured by increased hematocrit and decreased spleen volume in capture-
stressed yellowtail. In addition, Wells et al (1984) showed increased hematocrit and
hemoglobin and decreased pH in Antarctic cod subjected to net-capture stress. Likewise,
Devries (1981) demonstrated large increases in blood potassium levels and altered
erythrocyte ion exchange abilities in fish that have undergone net-capture stress.
A variety of methods are used to control a fish before blood sampling. Past samples
have been obtained at the TRCC by capturing a fish with a net and removing it from the
water before drawing blood. Observation has shown that this method involves a
