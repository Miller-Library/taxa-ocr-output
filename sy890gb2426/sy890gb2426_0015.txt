Figure 1. Blood sampling locations on the yellowfin tuna. In this study, blood was
sampled from the bulbus arteriosis.
Figure 2. Repeat hematocrit measurements in three individual fish separated by 6 days
There is no significant difference (paired Student's t-test, p-66)
Figure 3. Repeat hemoglobin measurements in three individual fish separated by 6 days
There is no significant difference (paired Student's t-test, p-.44).
Figure 4. Repeat red blood cell counts in three individual fish separated by 6 days. There
is no significant difference (paired Student's t-test, p- 88).
Figure 5. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values in different tank and diet treatments. There
are no significant differences (one-way ANOVA, hematocrit p= 11, hemoglobin p-.6).
Figure 6. A comparison of hematocrit values in sling-samples (current study), cannulated
samples (Korsmeyer, 1996), and net-samples (TRCC data). Net samples are significantly
higher than sling samples and cannulated samples (one-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD,
p5.05), while there was no significant difference between sling samples and cannulated
samples.
