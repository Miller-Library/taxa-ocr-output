Discussion
Results from measures of blood chemistry and hematology in this study indicate that
bulbus puncture blood sampling can be successfully repeated and results in a lower stress
response than in other techniques. We are interested in determining if this technique can
provide accurate, repeatable data on yellowfin blood.
The hematology results from the three repeat samples show that we can be fairly
confident about generating consistent data. This is necessary if we wish to use the
information either to set base-line blood parameters or use the results to evaluate the
physiological status of an individual. In other words, if we see a change in blood
chemistry from one week to the next, we want to be sure this change is due to actual
alteration of physiological processes, and not a result of the sampling process itself
Pooled data in this study includes samples from fish in different tanks being fed
different diets. All hematology and chemistry measures were compared between tanks and
diet with no differences being found. Thus, the pooled data represent a good estimate for
what the average captive tuna blood should look like. Only free fatty acid concentrations
show an increase over the two diet treatments. This is consistent with previous
experiments. Reynolds et al (1994) showed an increase in serum free fatty acid
concentration in dogs on a high fat diet compared to a high carbohydrate diet. Because the
free fatty acid measurements were done under variable conditions, our results tell us very
little about the normal range of free fatty acid in tuna blood. However, it does add
confidence to the repeatability of the sampling method. The way in which the blood was
