considerable amount of struggling by the fish for a prolonged period of time before the
sample can be taken.
Use of cannulation to obtain repeat samples has been helpful in determining resting
blood measurements in fish (Houston, 1990). Hematocrit values are generally lower in
cannulated fish, which implies less-stress and therefore more realistic measurements
(Sovio, et al, 1975). Cannulation of yellowfin tuna has been successful and has shown
relatively low hematocrit and hemoglobin values (Korsmeyer, unpublished results)
The use of anesthesia in blood sampling is another common method. A blood sample
can be taken without physically restraining the fish. However, anesthesia is known to
induce many changes in blood chemistry, including activation of adrenaline stress response
as well as increased hematocrit and hemoglobin measures (Houston, 1971). Fish must
also be handled first in order to anesthetize, and anesthesia has been shown to cause a high
level of mortality in tuna (Heidi Dewar, personal comment)
The dynamics of stress-mediated changes in blood chemistry and hematological
measurements, combined with our interest in determining average tuna blood
characteristics, led us to ask the question: can we develop a repeatable blood sampling
method that involves minimal stress and damage to the fish? The success of a sampling
technique can be assessed by comparing results to those obtained using techniques known
to cause stress-induced or other chemical changes in the blood. A consistent, accurate
sampling technique would prove valuable both in determining base-line values for captive
vellowfin tuna blood and for monitoring the health of the fish.
