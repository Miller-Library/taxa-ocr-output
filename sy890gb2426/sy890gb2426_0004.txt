Methods:
Tanks and Maintenance
All yellowfin tuna sampled were held at the TRCC in large holding tanks 30 ft. in
diameter and 6 ft. deep. Fish from two tanks were used for blood sampling (T2 and T3).
Tank temperatures were held constant at 22°C. Oxygen and pH levels in the water were
monitored daily.
Blood Sampling
We recognized two possible sampling sites, the caudal vessels in the tail region and the
bulbus arteriosis, which leads from the ventricle to the ventral aorta (Figure 1). Contact
with the tail region is observed to cause the fish to struggle, so sampling from the caudal
region would require forced physical restraint of the entire body. Also, because the caudal
vein and artery are close to each other, it would not be known if samples were of arterial
or venous blood. Sampling from the bulbus is risky because of its close proximity to the
ventricle (Figure 1). However, the bulbus is fairly elastic, which could prevent bleeding
after sampling. Careful dissection showed that a needle entering anterior to the bone
covering the bulbus would not hit the ventricle. An angle of about 45 ° toward posterior
was required to avoid hitting the structurally weaker ventral aorta. The bulbus puncture
was used to obtain all samples. Blood samples were taken inside the tank. Water levels
were lowered to about 1 meter and an average of 7 workers were in the tank throughout
the sampling process. Fish were constrained in a small area and caught with water filled
vinyl slings.
