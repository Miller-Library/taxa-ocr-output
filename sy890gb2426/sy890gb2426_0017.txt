Thanks to everyone at the TRCC who made this project possible. Especially to my
advisor Dr. Barbara Block for her patience, enthusiasm, and motivational skills; Heidi
Dewar for making this project fun and always having time; Dr. Tom for teaching me
about the finer points and keeping things loose, Chuck Farwell because there is no one
better at catching a tuna; Ellen Freund for her wisdom and wit; Doug Fudge for his
technical support and tuna knowledge, Denise Imai for all of her help and support; Beth
Condie and Victor Tubbesing for their assistance; and everyone else who joined in when
extra hands were needed.
