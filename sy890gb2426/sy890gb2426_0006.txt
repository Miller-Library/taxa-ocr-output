chemistry analysis (Stanford University, Department of Comparative Medicine,
Diagnostic Laboratory). See table 1 for blood chemistry parameters measured.
Over the course of 7 weeks, 27 samples were obtained from 18 different fish using the
sling technique, and blood analysis results were compared to values obtained from both
net sampling methods (TRCC data) and chronically cannulated fish (Korsmeyer,
unpublished) In three individuals, repeat samples were taken 6 days apart, and
hematology values were compared in each fish between sampling events.
Feeding Manipulation
In order to test the ability of the sling technique in measuring changes in blood chemistry
over changes in conditions, fish were sampled from an experimental tank (T2) in which the
diet was manipulated. For two weeks the fish were maintained on the standard TRCC low
fat diet (28 Kcal/Kg/day, 1% fat) of squid and smelt. The diet was then switched to a high
fat diet (28 Kcal/Kg/day, 8% fat) of sardines for four weeks. Blood samples were taken
from T2 fish at the end of each of the feeding periods. T3 fish were held to a constant diet
over all sampling periods (low fat, 40 Kcal/Kg/day). T3 fish were sampled on three
occasions at least one week apart.
