significant difference between values obtained from cannulation (hemoglobin -11.3 +7.
hematocrit =30.7 + 1.3) and sling-samples (Tukey's HSD, pÂ«05).
Diet Manipulation
Figure 8 shows the results of the T2 diet manipulation experiment. Free fatty acid
concentrations in blood serum doubled (0.25 mmol/L + O.03 to 0.524 mmol/L +0.03) in
the high fat diet (Student's t-test, p5.0005). This was the only significant change
recorded in the blood over change in diet.
