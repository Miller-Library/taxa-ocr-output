The first three samples were carried out using a forced restraint method. A fish was
caught in an open-ended vinyl sling, turned upside down, and placed on a modified vÂ¬
board with as little handling as possible. A vinyl covered foam flap (25 cm wide) was
then placed over the body and held firmly. The fish remained calm when a strip of blanket
soaked in PolyAqua fish Protectant was placed over the eyes. The sample was then
taken from the bulbus and the fish was released.
Fish sampled using forced restraint showed significant signs of handling trauma. This
led to the development of the sling technique, in which handling of the fish was minimized.
A fish was caught in a closed-ended vinyl sling, which was held closed under-water to
allow the fish to calm down. In this way, the fish was protected by an envelope of water.
The sling was opened and the fish was rolled over. Fish that fought or would not calm
down within a few seconds were immediately released to prevent injury and to insure low-
stress samples. The fish was held lightly in place and a blood sample was taken. Sampling
took less than 30 seconds. The relative stress levels of each fish in terms of struggle and
physical response to handling were recorded.
Approximately 3ml of blood was drawn into a 5 ml heparinized syringe (needle size 18-
20 ga 1.5 in.). A small amount was put into a tube containing EDTA and immediately
placed on ice. The remainder was put into a wax bottom serum separator with clot
activator. Blood from the EDTA tube was used to measure hematocrit, hemoglobin
(Sigma Diagnostics total hemoglobin kit), and red blood cell counts (Becton-Dickinson
unopette microcollection system). Blood in the serum separator was allowed to clot for
one hour, then centrifuged for 7 minutes at 3500 rpm. Serum was frozen at -80 C for
analysis of free fatty acid concentrations (Wako NEFA kit, Biochemical Diagnostics) and
