Conclusion
We developed a new method of blood sampling in which blood is taken from the
bulbus arteriosis of captive yellowfin tuna. This method has proven to be consistently
repeatable. Furthermore, based on hematology and blood chemistry comparisons between
this method and other common sampling methods, it appears that samples analyzed in the
current study are representative of minimally stressed fish. Hemoglobin and hematocrit
values closely resemble those obtained using cannulation methods Therefore, we are
confident that this technique can be used to determine accurate parameters for healthy
tuna blood, as well as aid in the comparison between various physiological states.
