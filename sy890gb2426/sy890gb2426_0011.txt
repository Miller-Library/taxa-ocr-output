(personal observation). The increases we observed in potassium, CPK, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine in net-sampled fish therefore correlate well with what we
know about the probable stress state at the time of sampling.
Increases in SGOT and SGPT are often indicative of liver dysfunction (McDonald and
Milligan, 1992). We have to take into account the health state of the fish chosen for net-
sampling. These fish were usually sick or lethargic, and were chosen for sampling before
being euthenized. It is likely that other physiological factors contributed to the results we
see. However, many of the changes are probably a result of extended stress and muscle
activity that occurs when netting a fish.
The observed increases in phosphorous and cholesterol in net-sampled fish do not seem
to be directly attributable to a stress response. This increase could either be an artifact of
variable handling or environmental conditions that were not controlled, or a secondary
effect of changes in blood chemistry and osmolarity. To explain this effect, there will need
to be more samples taken using both methods. Likewise, to better quantify all the changes
we have observed in this study, more research needs to be done on the comparative
aspects of sampling techniques.
