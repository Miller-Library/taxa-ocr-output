sampled does not significantly alter the ability to accurately measure changes in blood
chemistry.
A number of lines of evidence show that samples obtained using bulbus puncture
techniques represent a relatively low level of stress. The hematocrit and hemoglobin
values obtained in this study are nearly identical to those from chronically cannulated fish.
Because cannulated fish are allowed to recover from handling prior to sampling, it is
assumed that they are only minimally stressed. These results indicate that the samples we
get using the sling technique are representative of fairly non-stressed tuna.
Blood chemistry differences were found between sling-sampled and net-sampled fish.
Increases in potassium, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alkaline phosphatase, and
creatinine are all likely to be related to sampling condition. CPK is a muscle enzyme that
increases rapidly with motor activity (McDonald and Milligan, 1992). Average measures
for CPK were 2000% higher in net-sampled fish. This result shows CPK as a possible
indicator of stress in captive yellowfin tuna. In one instance, an individual that struggled
for up to 30 seconds in the sling before sampling had a CPK level that was 900% higher
than the average sling sample (personal observation). Alkaline phosphatase and creatinine
are also enzymes used in muscle activity (McDonald and Milligan, 1992). It is apparent
that one of the first effects of stress response in these fish is to increase muscle activity.
This is probably related to the adrenaline mediated changes in which red blood cells are
mobilized to prepare for increased oxygen demand in the body. Serum potassium has
been shown to increase during stress due to leakage from muscle cells and lysing of
erythrocytes (Railo, 1985). A combination of stress and cell lysis probably occurred in
this study, as evidenced by visible red coloring of serum from some net sampled fish
