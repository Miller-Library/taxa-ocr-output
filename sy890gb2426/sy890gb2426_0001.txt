Abstract
Blood samples are used in many organisms as an indication of health and physiological
state. In yellowfin tuna, blood analysis is complicated by stress responses to handling.
These responses include changes in serum osmolarity, blood metabolites, and release of
red blood cells from the spleen leading to increased hematocrit. Samples from stressed
fish therefore do not accurately represent the resting health and physiology of an
individual. This study presents a new method developed to minimize stress levels during
blood sampling. Blood is drawn from the bulbus arteriosis of captive yellowfin tuna while
the fish are still in the tank. Twenty-seven samples were taken from 18 individuals over
the course of seven weeks. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, ions, and
metabolites were measured and compared to values obtained from fish sampled using
other common techniques. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were similar to those
measured in chronically cannulated tuna, and lower than for fish sampled using a common
practice of capture in a net (hematocrit 31.6% + 0.8 vs. 44.1% + 8.5 ; hemoglobin 11.1
g/dl +0.3 vs. 17.0 g/dl +2.0). Creatine phosphokinase, alkaline phosphatase, potassium,
and creatinine (all related to stress and/or increased muscle activity) significantly increased
in net-sampled fish. Therefore, fish sampled using a bulbus puncture appear to be less
stressed. Using this sampling technique, an experiment was run in which diet in one tank
was changed from a normal 1% fat diet to a high 8% fat diet. Blood samples were taken
before and after the 8% diet treatment. Serum free fatty acid concentrations doubled
(0.25 mmol/L +0.03 vs. 0.524 mmol/L + 0.03) in the 8% fat fed fish that were sampled.
The results of these experiments demonstrate an ability to measure changes in blood
chemistry using the new sampling techniques. This study will help determine what is
physiologically "normal" in yellowfin tuna blood.
