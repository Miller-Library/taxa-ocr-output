Figure 7. A comparison of hemoglobin values in sling-samples (current study), cannulated
samples (Korsmeyer, 1996), and net-samples (TRCC data). Net samples are significantly
higher than sling samples and cannulated samples (one-way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD,
pS.05), while there was no significant difference between sling samples and cannulated
samples.
Figure 8. Changes in free fatty acid concentrations ([FFA)) in high fat vs low fat diet
Increase in [FFA] in high fat diet is significant (Student's t-test, p5.005).
