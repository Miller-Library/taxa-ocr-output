Repeat Sampling
Of the twenty-seven samples using the sling technique there was one mortality, giving a
success rate of 95%. The mortality was associated with the forced restraint method.
Hematocrit (Figure 2), hemoglobin (Figure 3), and red blood cell count (Figure 4)
values are shown for the three repeat samples. There was no significant differences in any
of the measurements between sampling dates (paired Students t-test, pr.05). There was
no significant difference in hematocrit (p=. 11) or hemoglobin (p=. 6) over dietary
treatment (Figure 5, one-way ANOVA, p=05). There were no significant changes in any
other blood parameter between diets or tank, therefore values from 27 sling-samples were
pooled to determine measured ranges. A summary of blood analysis from all samples in
this study is compared to results from net sampling techniques (Table 1).
Stress Indices
Hemoglobin values of net-sampled fish were significantly higher than sling-sampled
fish (Student's t-test, p.05). Significant increases in net-samples were also seen in
alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, cholesterol, creatinine, phosphorous, potassium,
SGOT, and SGPT (Student's t-test, pS.05). Although not statistically significant, an
increase was seen in creatine phosphokinase (2000 %).
A further comparison between sling-samples, net-samples, and chronically cannulated
samples showed significant increases in both hematocrit (Figure 6) and hemoglobin
(Figure 7) in net-sampled fish (one way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, pS.05). There was no
