Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
Introduction
Individuals of Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847) are widely distri-
buted along the western coast of the United States (the Straits of Juan de
Fuca, Washington to San Diego, California (Burghardt and Burghardt, 1969)).
yet information on their diet and feeding habits is largely speculative.
According to MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1919, pg. 386) Nuttallina are largely
sedentary animals, found in deep, form-fitting depressions in the hard
substratum, and seldom or never venture out to feed. MacGinitie and MacGinitie
suggest that such animals have forsaken the grazing habit and subsist on
algal debris which settles in the depressions. The absence of detailed studies
supporting or contradicting this view motivated the present study.
Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California provides several kinds of habitats.
of which two were selected for study. One consists of crevices in vertical
rocky surfaces at the +3.0 to +.0 foot tidal level, exposed to heavy surf
action, and on the western portion of the Point. Here animals commonly found
with Nuttallina are the barnacles Tetraclita squamosa Darwin, 1851 and
Chthalmalus spp., and the mussel Mytilus californianus Conrad, 1837. The
second habitat consists of beds of calcareous tubes formed by the colonial
cirratulid worm Dodecaceria fistulicola Ehlers, 1901. Here Nuttallina
are found in depressions 1 to 2 cm. deep on the mostly horizontal surface
ane
of the beds at about the +1.0 foot tidal level, exposed to moderate surf.
