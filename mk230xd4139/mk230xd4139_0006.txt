Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
Since the diet of N. californica indicates feeding by grazing on larger
algae, and these are not available within deep depressions in the
Dodecaceria bed, feeding acitivity must occur when animals emerge from
their shelters at high tide. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis.
Numerous Nuttallina were observed crawling out of their depressions when
the bed was awash on an incoming tide; however, further studies need to
be done in order to determine whether this movement is correlated with
feeding activity.
