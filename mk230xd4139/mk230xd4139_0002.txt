Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
The Dodecaceria beds were located on the
eastern portion of the Point. Few other animals are found upon
the Dodecaceria bed itself but neighboring it (on the exposed rocky substratum)
are Tegula funebralis Adams, 1854, Phragmatopoma californica Fewkes, 1889
and Anthopleura xanthogrammica Brandt, 1835.
The objective of this study was to compare the diet and feeding habits
of Nuttallina californica in these two habitats. Specifically to
define their diet, determine the sources of the food eaten, and compare the
foods eaten with those apparently available in the microhabitat.
Methods
A specific site at each of the two study areas as well as one site at
Carmel Beach were chosen. At each site food resources inthe vicinity of
Nuttallina californica were determined by randomly placing a 25 X 25 cm.
grid overthe site and measuring the area covered by each macroscopic alga.
This was done four times at each location. The relative abundance or availÂ¬
ability of each alga was taken asthe area covered by that alga divided by
the total area covered by all of the algae present. At each location all of
the N. californica found within the areas surveyed for algal cover were
