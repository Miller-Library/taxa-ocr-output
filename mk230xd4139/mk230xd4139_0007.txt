Natural History Notes on the Two Populations of Nuttallina californica
The populations of Nuttallina californica studied in the two contrasting
habitats differed markedly in their external appearances. N. californica
from the Dodecaceria bed possessed valves so worn that species-characteristic
markings were erased. The shells of these chitons were beige in color and
pitted by a blue-green alga, Entophysalis deusta (Meneghini) Drouet &
Daily. This coloration exactly matched that of the Dodecaceria bed. In
addition, the girdle bristles were predominantly white with scattered
reddish brown ones. In contrast the rocky crevice Nuttallina possessed
black valves with occasional white stripes down either side of a shiny
dorsal ridge. The girdle bristles were primarily reddish-brown with more
white ones towards the outer edge of the girdle. These Nuttallina were
often found with a profuse growth of algae on both valves and girdle. These
included Endocladia muricata (Postels & Ruprecht) J.G. Agardh, Corallina spp.,
Polysiphonia hendryi Gardner, Cladophora trichotoma (C.A. Agardh) KÃ¼tzing,
Rhodoglossum affine (Harvey) Kylin, Peyssonnelia sp., and Microcladia sp.
Representative specimens collected from the Dodecaceria bed were
positively identified as N. californica by Mr. Allyn G. Smith of the
California Academy of Sciences.
