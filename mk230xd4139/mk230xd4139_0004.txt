Abetween Nuttallina of the different habitats could be seen. Microscopic
algae such as diatoms and blue-greens were also found in all of the
animals, yet the abundance of large algal pieces comes from macroscopic
algae. The frequency of occurrence of various macro-algae in the guts of
different individuals is shown in Fig. 1. The most frequently occurring
algae in the animals from rocky crevice communities are Corallina spp.
(80% of the individuals examined), Endocladia muricata (Postels & Ruprecht)
J.G. Agardh (60%), and Cladophora trichotoma (C.A. Agardh) KÃ¼tzing (188);
the most frequently consumed algae by Dodecaceria bed animals were
Gelidium spp. (53%) and Cladophora trichotoma (76%). These figures correspond
roughly to the relative frequency with which these algae are found in the
habitats from which these animals came.

The of the algal distribution in the habitat vs. average
diet at the three field sites is shown in Fig. 2. Corallina spp. make up
a much higher percentage of the gut contents of Nuttallina collected at
all three locations than would be expected by the composition of the flora
in these habitats. In addition crustose corallines are found in considerably
omallr
fewer amounts in the guts than expected by their presence in the habitat.
This suggests that Nuttallina may preferentially seek out erect corallines
