Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
over crustose forms. This may be due to limitations imposed upon their
feeding habits by the manner in which their radulas work. The radula
in these chitons appears to be best adapted for use in consuming large
bushy algae by tearing them into pieces or swallowing them whole if they
are small enough. The radula does not appear to function as a scraping
organ, which would be best suited in consuming crusts.
Plant
According to Dr. I.A. Abbott (personal communication), the ae most
commonly found in the study areas in terms of biomass and therefore to
be expected in drift feeders are: the flowering plant Phyllospadix sp.,
the brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C.A. Agardh, and red algae
of Lheganera Rhodymenia sp; Botryoglossum farlowianum (J.G. Agardh)
DeToni, Botryocladia pseudodichotoma (Farlow) Kylin, and Gigartina
corymbifera (KÃ¼tzing) J.G. Agardh. None of these was found within the
guts of the Nuttallina californica examined. Thus it is highly unlikely
Dant
that the Nuttallina studied were feeding upon drift aigae.
