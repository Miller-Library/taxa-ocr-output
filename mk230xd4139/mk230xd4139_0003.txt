Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
collected. This included a total of 25 animals from rocky crevices at
Mussel Point and Carmel Beach and 26 animals from a Dodecaceria bed at
Mussel Point. The specimens were immediately preserved in a 10% formaldeÂ¬
hyde solution to stop further digestion. Gut contents were analysed by
removing the digestive tract from the stomach to the small intestine and
squeezing out its contents on to a microscope slide. This was
examined
under a dissecting scope and the macroscopic pieces of algae identified,
counted, and removed. A compound microscope was used to identify the
smaller pieces of algae on the basis of color, cell structure and size.
Relative abundance of each type of alga within the guts was estimated by
counting the number of pieces of each alga found (with rough attempts to
correct for gross differences in size), and dividing bythe total number of
pieces of algae found.
Results and Discussion
From preliminary gut content analyses it was immediately apparent that
instead of merely scraping at algae with its radula, Nuttallina was taking
in large pieces. Length of the largest piece in the gut of each of 31 animals
was measured and the number standardized to the size of the chiton by
expressing it as the percent of body length. These figures show N. californica
is capable of consuming pieces of algae up to 20% of its body length, although
