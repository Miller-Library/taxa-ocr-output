Diet and Feeding Habits of N. californica
Figure Explanations
Figure 1:
Comparison of the frequency of occurence of macroscopic algae in
the guts of Nuttallina californica from rocky crevices (n-25, with full
guts) with those from Dodecaceria beds (n-26, of which 9 contained no
food. Percentages were calculated on the basis of the 17 animals with
full guts).
Figure 2:
Comparison of algal composition in terms of percent of total algal cover
at study sites with corresponding relative abundance of the algae in
the gut contents of N. californica collected from each area at the time of
the survey. From Carmel rocky crevices n-8; from Mussel Point rocky crevices
n-6; and from Mussel Point Dodecaceria beds n-17.
