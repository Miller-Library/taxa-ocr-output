Kn values within their physiological temperature ranges (Fields and Somero 1997,
Yancey and Somero 1978, Holland et al. 1997, Fields and Somero in prep.). Upon
comparison of the shark K patterns, it is apparent that the Kp values for each
shark within its temperature range are very similar (Fig. 1A).
The rays, in contrast, do not exhibit Kp conservation in this study. For each
temperature of measurement above zero, the LDH-A ortholog of B. eatonii, which
experiences habitat temperatures from -1.86째 to 1째C (Eastman 1993), displays Km
values below those of the R. bonasus Az-LDH, which is found at temperatures
ranging from 20째 to 32째C (. Torres, University of Southern Florida, pers. comm.)
(Fig. 1B). The lower Kp values, and corresponding higher pyruvate affinities of the
Antarctic species' Az-LDH homologue are puzzling. Because affinity rises (and Km
drops) as temperature decreases, one would expect that enzymes functioning at
colder temperatures would compensate by exhibiting lower intrinsic affinity (and
higher Kp) at any given temperature. One possible explanation for the rays' kinetic
data is that the presence of organic solutes such as urea and TMAO within the
organisms under physiological conditions alter the kinetics of the enzymes. It is
possible that the ray A4-LDH homologues display affinity (Kp) conservation under
physiological conditions.
Mechanisms of temperature adaptation in elasmobranchs and teleosts. I compared
the subtropical elasmobranch Az-LDH sequences to their cold habitat counterparts to
explore the primary structure differences that might occur in organisms adapted to
different temperatures. In the rays, non-conservative differences occurred with
higher frequency in two regions: the aH helix and the BH-alG loop (Fig. 2).
