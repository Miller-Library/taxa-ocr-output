must adjust to their physiological temperature ranges. This adjustment must occur
at all levels, including the function of proteins. For example, because glycolysis is a
nearly universal biological process, glycolytic enzymes must function similarly in a
broad range of thermal environments. In affecting the chemical environment in
which a protein functions, temperature influences the assembly of subunits, global
protein stability, substrate binding and conformational changes during catalysis.
In order to compensate for the perturbing effects of temperature, proteins may
undergo changes in primary structure through evolution. These changes do not
have to be dramatic; substitutions are found outside the active site, in regions that
do not change the chemistry of catalysis, but affect the movement of catalytic
domains (Holland et al. 1997). Moreover, differences in stability and flexibility may
only consist of a glycine/alanine substitution (Fields and Somero, 1997). Such
changes have been explored in teleost fishes (Fields and Somero, 1997; Fields and
Somero in prep.), and the study of elasmobranchs may help us discover whether
evolutionarily distinct organisms use similar sequence changes in their enzymes to
adapt to their thermal environments.
Elasmobranchs provide an interesting study system not only because of their
evolutionary distance from bony fishes but also because of their unique
biochemistry. Elasmobranchs such as sharks and rays concentrate urea and
trimethylamine oxide (TMAÖ) in their body fluids in order to maintain osmotic
balance with the surrounding seawater. Although urea is a protein denaturant,
elasmobranch enzymes clearly function at physiological urea concentrations. They
may even require the presence of urea to exhibit enzyme kinetics comparable to
other organisms (Yancey and Somero 1978). However, it has also been demonstrated
that TMAÖ may counteract the effects of urea in some organisms (Yancey and
