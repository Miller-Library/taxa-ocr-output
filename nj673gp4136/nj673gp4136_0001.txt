ABSTRACT
Thermal adaptation at the biochemical level has been demonstrated in previous
studies of bony fishes and other vertebrates. One criterion that has been used to
assess the possible presence of thermal adaptation is the Michaelis-Menten constant,
or KK values have been shown to be conserved among teleosts and some other
vertebrates within their physiological temperature ranges. One possible mechanism
by which homologous proteins may conserve K at extreme temperatures is by
changes in primary structure. The relationship between temperature adaptation and
changes in primary structure has been explored in teleost fishes, but has yet to be
studied in elasmobranchs. In this study, the variation of pyruvate Kp with
temperature and the deduced amino acid sequences of four elasmobranch Aj-LDH
orthologs were compared. Both the subtropical and the cold temperate species of
sharks were found to display conservation of pyruvate Kp over physiological
temperature ranges, while the subtropical and the Antarctic species of rays did not.
The deduced amino acid sequences of the shark enzymes exhibited different regions
of variability than the LDH's of teleosts previously studied, while the sequences of
the ray enzymes exhibited similar regions of variability to those of teleost orthologs.
It was concluded that there may a limited number of sites at which temperature
adaptation in AA-LDH occurs, and that even closely related organisms do not
necessarily use the same sequence changes to adapt to temperature.
INTRODUCTION
Life occurs at a wide range of temperatures, from below zero to above 100 degrees
Celsius. Because life processes including development, mitosis, and membrane
function are affected by the thermal environment in which they occur, organisms
