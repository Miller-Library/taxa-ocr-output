Fig. 1. (A) Apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Kr
species G. cirratum and P. xaniurus. (B) Apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (KmÂ¬
PYR) of A4-LDH from the ray species R. bonasus and B. eatonii.
Fig. 2. Deduced regions of amino acid sequences of LDH-A for the four
elasmobranch species studied, as well as the dogfish (S. acanthius) sequence (Stock
and Powers 1995). Residues in bold type indicate non-conservative differences
within the ray sequences or shark sequences. The text above the sequences indicates
the location of second degree structure (Abad-Zapatero et al. 1987).
Fig. 3. Cartoon of dogfish Az-LDH structure after Abad-Zapatero et al. (1987). One
monomer is shown with selected secondary structure labeled.
