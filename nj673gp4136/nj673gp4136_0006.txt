hydrophobic, for example.) There were twenty-eight differences among the 220
residues of sequence obtained from both of the shark species, twelve of which were
non-conservative. The differences were distributed non-randomly throughout the
four A4-LDH sequences; regions of high conservation among all species include
residues 96-110, 155-180, 190-210, and 245-254 (Fig. 2). These regions include the
catalytic loop (aaf 96-113, Abad-Zapatero et al., 1987) and substrate and cofactor
binding residues (e.g., Arg107, Asp167, Arg170, His194, Thr249; Abad-Zapatero et al.,
1987; Sakowicz et al., 1993). [Please note that the residue numbers in this paper
correspond to the sequences I obtained; they are not identical to the sequence
numbering systems used in previous studies.
DISCUSSION
In analyzing these data on Kp and deduced amino acid sequences, I am attempting
to answer three questions: 1) Do the four elasmobranch Az-LDH orthologs exhibit
temperature-adaptive changes? 2) When compared to teleosts, are these
elasmobranch species using similar primary structure changes in their AA-LDH
sequences to adapt to temperature? 3) How might the primary structure changes
lead to the observed kinetic differences between the elasmobranch AA-LDH
orthologs studied?
Temperature adaptation as assessed by kinetic data. At every temperature of
measurement, the shark LDH ortholog of P. xaniurus, which experiences habitat
temperatures from 4째 to 10째C (G. Somero, pers. comm.), exhibited higher Kp values
than the G. cirratum ortholog, which is found at temperatures ranging from 20째 to
32째C (J. Torres, University of Southern Florida, pers. comm.). This pattern is
consistent with earlier studies which show that organisms tend to share comparable
