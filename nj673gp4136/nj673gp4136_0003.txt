evolutionary distance from teleosts makes the study of their temperature adaptation
at the macromolecular level of interest to biochemists, evolutionary biologists, and
comparative biologists.
Iused lactate dehydrogenase-A (Az-LDH) to explore the mechanism by which
homologous proteins might adapt to different thermal environments. Aj-LDH is
the enzyme that converts pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NADt during
anaerobic glycolysis. In order to describe temperature adaptation, I compared the

among four elasmobranch Az-LDH orthologs. Kn values are typically very sensitive
to temperature, usually rising as measurement temperature is increased. However,
in previous studies comparing various organisms' pyruvate Kp's over a range of
temperatures, it has been found that enzymes tend to conserve Kp at the
temperatures at which they function (Somero 1995, Holland et al. 1997). In this
study, changes in primary structure were compared with the different ways in which
PrR varied with temperature among the four species' LDH orthologs.

Knowledge of LDH 3-D structure (Abad-Zapatero et al. 1987) and conformational
changes during catalysis (Dunn et al. 1991) were used to interpret correlations
between kinetics and sequence variation, and to compare these correlations to
biochemical temperature adaptation in teleosts.
METHODS
Study Organisms
The four species of elasmobranchs used in this study were the nurse shark
Ginglymostoma cirratum (subtropical), the file tail cat shark Parmaturus xaniurus
(cold temperate), the cow nosed ray Rhinoptera bonasus (subtropical), and the
Antarctic bat skate Bathyraja eatonii.G. cirratum was collected in the Florida Keys,
