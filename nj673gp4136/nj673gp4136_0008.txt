The first region of high variability between the two species of rays was the aH helix,
at the carboxy end of the monomer (aaf 311-327). Helix aH plays a significant part
during catalysis because aH, along with helix alG-a2G and the catalytic loop (aaft 97-
107) form the mouth of the molecule, moving toward one another during
formation of the internal vacuole during catalysis (Dunn et al. 1991) (Fig. 3).
The most dramatic sequence difference between the rays in the aH region is at the
amino end of the helix. A proline residue in the subtropical species is replaced by a
serine in the Antarctic species, a pattern that has also been shown to occur in
Antarctic teleosts (Fig. 2). Proline is a unique residue because its side chain is bonded
not only to the alpha carbon, but also to nitrogen, forming a five-membered ring.
This ring prevents proline from assuming a broad range of conformations.
Replacing a proline with a serine would therefore increase the flexibility of helix aH
relative to the rest of the molecule.
The second region of high variability between the rays was the BH-alG loop (aat
207-226). The BH-alG loop links part of the Aj-LDH active site (containing residues
His194, Asp167 and Arg172) to one part of the 'mouth' of the monomer, helix alG¬
a2G, which contains Tyr140, a residue required for enzyme activity. The ßH-alG
loop, which does not possess secondary structure, possesses a high temperature
factor (Abad-Zapatero et al. 1987) and may ease the movement of the alG-a2G helix
during conformational changes during catalysis (Fields and Somero in prep.) (Fig. 3).
Hence it is a possible source of adjustment for increased flexibility of catalytically
important regions in the enzyme.
In the ßH-alG loop, there are two non-conservative differences between the
subtropical and Antarctic ray species. In the first, a serine at position 211 in the
