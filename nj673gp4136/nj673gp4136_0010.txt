possible that the high variability within the shark LDH sequences in the amino
terminal arm contributes to their differences in kinetic data.
While analysis of the shark sequence differences is limited, it is noteworthy that the
shark species do not display high variability in the ÃŸH-alG loop, as previously seen
in teleosts. It is also interesting that the two species of rays seem to use similar
primary sequence changes to the teleosts in thermal adaptation of their Aj-LDH
orthologs. Two conclusions may be drawn from these variability patterns: 1)There
may be a finite number of areas in the A4-LDH sequence that allow temperature
adaptation. 2)Elasmobranchs do not all use similar sequence changes to adapt to
different temperatures.
Flexibility and thermal adaptation of proteins. My analysis of the relationship
between proteins' primary sequence and temperature adaptation can be explained by
a theory developed by Fields and Somero (in prep.) as follows. At a given
temperature, a protein may exist in a number of different conformations. As the
temperature increases, the number of possible conformations and the rate at which
the protein changes between them increases. However, the amount of time spent in
any one conformation decreases as temperature increases. Thus the amount of time
spent in a conformation appropriate for binding decreases, and Kp increases.
Alternatively, increased flexibility of a protein due to primary structure changes can
also cause the protein to undergo conformational changes more rapidly. Thus
changes in the flexibility of a protein and changes in the temperature at which it
functions can cause similar (or counteracting) effects on the kinetic function of a
protein. Therefore, the perturbing effects of temperature may be compensated for by
varying the flexibility of the protein through changes in primary structure.
