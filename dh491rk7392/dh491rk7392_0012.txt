the actual environmental conditions faced by these isopods
is lacking. Some data in the literature, however, can
provide guidelines relative to the ranges in temperature.
salinity and O, tension experienced by both I. montereyensis
and I. resecata. Johnson (1965) examined the temperatures
in Tomales Bay, where I. resecata are commonly found living
on Zostera, and reported that whereas ocean temperatures
had an annual range of 12-15* C from winter to summer,
the cove in Tomales Bay which he studied varied from
8-23° C during the year, a range of 15° C as compared to
3 C on the open coast. Conceivably the temperature range
on the Zostera blades, where the I. resecata lives, might be
even greater due to factors such as increased heat absorption
due to its dark color.
Some physical parameters of the kelp beds off Hop-
kins Marine Station were monitored for 48 consecutive hours
in the summer of 1971 (Pearse, 1971), and the daily surface
temperature where populations of I. resecata are located
was found to vary between about 12.5°-15° C. Three measurements
on a spring day in 1973 showed the temperature during daylight
hours to vary between 12-16° C. There is even less data
on the habitat of I. montereyensis, but a bay Phyllospadix
bed where I. montereyensis does not occur was found to have
a late afternoon temperature of 15-16° C in the spring. Open
coast Phyllospadix beds might be presumed to have temperatures
approximately equivalent to those of the surface ocean
temperatures because of the large amount of wåter movement
and mixing between the intertidal Phyllospadix beds and the
