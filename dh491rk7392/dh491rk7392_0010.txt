ability. When a Phyllospadix blade is taken out of the water
most I. montereyensis either drop off the blade or crawl
back into the water. When Macrocystis is lifted out of the
water, I. resecata tend to slide to the underside of the stipe
or walk down it, although on occasion some may also drop off.
In general, I. resecata maintains a stronger grip on its substrate
when it is held out of water than I. montereyensis when it is
held out of water. How the animals behave in surf is a
different question, however. Holding ability in a natural
situation is quite difficult to investigate and so I therefore
directed my attention more towards examining the morph-
ology of the pereaopods hoping to find differences in
structure which would suggest differential holding ability and
could be correlated with differences in wave action
in the isopods' respective habitats.
Figure 8 shows drawings of the 7th pereaopods of I.
montereyensis and I. resecata drawn in poitions characteristic
for the animals in grasping their substrate. In I. montereyensis
the segments tend to be short and wide and there are more
bristles on the propodus, possibly to increase frictional
contact. In addition, the dactyl is more fully developed
than in I. resecata. I. resecata in contrast has rather long
and sparcely spaced bristles on the propodus and the
dactyl is weakly produced.
Characteristically, I. resecata keeps its pereaopods
more extended than I. montereyensis because it is on a broader
surface, either a Macrocystis blade or else the relatively large
diameter stipe. I. montereyensis, on the other hand,
