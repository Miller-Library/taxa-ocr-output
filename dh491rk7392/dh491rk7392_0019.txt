FIGURE CAPTIONS
1. Survival curves for I. resecata and I. montereyensis
in solutions of different salinities. x- I. resecata,
o- I. montereyensis. Salinities are expressed as % sea water.
Experiments were terminated after 23 hours.
2. LT-50's for I. resecata and I. montereyensis in solu-
tions of different salinities. Salinities are expressed
as % sea water. Empty bars represent I. resecata, cross¬
hatched bars represent I. montereyensis. N=6 for 75% sea
water; N=10 for 125%, 150%, and 175% sea water; N=12 for 50%
sea water; N=22 for 100% and 200% sea water; and N-24 for 0%
and 25% sea water.
3. Survival curves for I. resecata and I. montereyensis
in different temperatures. x-I. resecata, o-I. montereyensis.
Temperatures are expressed in C. Experiments were terminated
after 23 hours.
4. LT-50's for I. resecata, I. montereyensis, and I. stenops
in different temperatures. Empty bars represent I. resecata,
cross-hatched bars represent I. montereyensis, and stippled
bars represent I. stenops. Temperatures are expressed in C'.
N=6 for 22°; N=10 for 40°; N=16 for 20°; and N=20 for 35
30, and 15° except for the I. stenops bar at 15% for which N=16.
5. Respiration rate as a function of wet weight in I.
resecata and I. montereyensis at 15° C. x- I. resecata, o-
yensis. Animals used ranged from.0186 gm to
I. monter
2325 gm and respiration rates ranged from 3.60 to 20.27
microliters O,/hr.
