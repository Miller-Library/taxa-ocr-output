with animals in them were filled with the anoxic sea water
and sealed. A second water sample for Winkler analysis was
taken after the tubes were filled in the first few exper-
iments to be sure that water of the same oxygen level was
being placed into each tube. In all cases where this
was done, the second sample was found to have essentially the
same oxygen level as the first sample (+.02 ml 0,/ 1 sea water).
The sealed tubes were checked every 10 minutes until only
one or two animals were still alive, and an LT-50 for the ten
animals of each species was subsequently interpolated for the
particular experimental oxygen concentration. The experiment
was then repeated nine times at different oxygen tensions.
Results: Figure 5 is a graph of log respiration rate vs.
log wet weight. While there is some indication tha a male
I. resecata of a given weight may have a slightly higher respiration
rate than a male I. montereyensis of the same weight, the
difference is statistically insignificant. Therefore, the
possible differences in oxygen levels between the bay and
open coast habitats are not reflected in the respiration
rates of the two species in fully oxygenated water.
An experiment was performed on I. resecata to determine
if body weight had any affect on time of death at a given
low oxygen level. The experiment was performed in the same
manner as the other low oxygen experiments except that the
animals were weighed before the experiment. Figure 6 is a
graph of log survival time vs. log wet weight at an oxygen
concentration of .42 ml 0,/ 1 sea water. Two females and
