the same tidal level as the bay Zostera. Here, individuals
spend much of their time underwater but can be washed by
wave action into tide pools at higher levels. Work by Lee
(1966) seems to indicate that juveniles of this species
occur in the inshore tide pool areas but move back out into
the Phyllospadix beds as adults.
Given these two species, one a typical bay inhabitant and
the other a typical outer coastal species, it was decidedcto
focus on those physical parameters that probably repreÂ¬
sent the major differences between bay and open coastal habitats.
These parameters were considered to be salinity, temperature,
oxygen level, and wave action. Accordingly, data was gathered
on salinity and temperature tolerances, respiration rates,
and tolerance to low oxygen conditions. The peraeopods were
also examined with an eye towards determing difference
in holding ability under conditions of wave stress.
RESULTS
Tolerance to Physical Parameters--Salinity.
Procedure: Concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%,
175%, and 200% sea water were made from Instant Ocean (available
from The Dolphin, San Jose). Tap water which had been kept
in an open container overnight in a heat closet to drive
out the chlorine was used for fresh water. 1. resecata
and I. montereyensis were kept in holding aquaria in the
laboratory for several days at ambient sea water temperature
before tests were run. Subsequently samples of either 5 or 6
