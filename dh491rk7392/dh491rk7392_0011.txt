grips the thin, narrow Phyllospadix blades by holding them
against its ventral surface with the dactyls. While I,
esecata can pierce the surface of Macrocystis with its dactyl,
1. montereyensis seems to engage in a more secure stance
becuase it actually encircles its substrate. The fact the
1. montereyensis is moved into higher intertidal zones,
presumably by wave action (Lee, 1966), suggests that
its holding ability, particularly in juveniles, which
make up the predominant portion of those I. montereyensis
found at higher levels, is not perfect. Nevertheless, the
morphology of the pereaopods is consistant with the suggestion
of a holding ability greater than that of I. resecata.
This would have obvious advantages in light of its more
turbulent habitat.
DISCUSSION
Experimental evidence has shown that while both species
studied are euryhaline, I. montereyensis survives markedly
better than I. resecata at salinities of 25% and 50% sea water,
and somewhat better in both fresh water and 200% sea water.
I. montereyensis also seems more tolerant of temperature
stress, surviving better than I. resecata at both 30Â° and
35 C. While the evidence on oxygen stress is not clearcut,
this is a suggestion that I. resecata performs slightly better
than I. montereyensis at oxygen concentrations in the range
of .60 to 2.22 ml 0,/1 sea water.
