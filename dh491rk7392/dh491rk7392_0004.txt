animals were placed in finger bowls and covered by 200 ml
of each of the solutions. The animals were chosen randomly
and included males and females from approximately 6 mm to
25 mm in size. The bowls were placed in a 15° C constant tem¬
perature room and aerated continuously. At hourly intervals
the bowls were examined and the number of live animals
noted. Criteria for death were absence of pleopod movement,
pleopod extension from the body, open uropods, lack of per-
eaopod and antennal movement, and lack of response to mech-
anical stimulation or removal from the water. Tests were then
repeated four times, except in the case of 50% sea water
which was repeated only once. Data from all replicates
at each salinity were pooled.
Results: The data from these experiments is presented
in figure 1. At all salinities I. montereyensis survives at
least as well, if not better than, I. resecata. In fresh water
the stress is apparently too severe to allow much distinc-
tion between the two species. At 25% and 50% sea water,
however, the greater survival of I. montereyensis is marked.
Both species seem to survive salinities equally well from
75% to 175% sea water for at least 23 hours. I. montereyens
again appears to show greater survival in 200% sea water.
Several of the survival curves are approximately sigmoid,
suggesting that tolerance to salinity stress is normally dis-
tributed. Isolated cases of mortality are due primarily to
cannibalism.
LT-50's at the various salinities were interpolated from
the raw data and are summarized in figure 2. Both species are
