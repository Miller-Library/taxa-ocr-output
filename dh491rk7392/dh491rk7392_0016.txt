than either I. resecata or I. stenops, can tolerate higher
levels of temperature and salinity. I. resecata, living in
Zostera beds which approach low oxygen levels at night,
performs better in low oxygen conditions. I. stenops,
living in a more homogenious environment than that found
in either the bay or in Phyllospadix beds and tide pools, has
the least tolerance to extremes of all three species
studied. Until more information is gathered, however.
particularly field data, very little can be said conclusively
about what affect the tolerance differences have on the actual
distribution of I. montereyensis, I. resecata, or I. stenops.
