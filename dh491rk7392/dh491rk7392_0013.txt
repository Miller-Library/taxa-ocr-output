offshore ocean surface. This would give the Phyllospadix
beds an annual temperature variation of 12-15° C. Unfortunately
there is little information on the temperature conditions of
the tide pools into which I. montereyensis are periodically
washed.
Pearse's study showed the oxygen levels of the
Macrocystis to vary considerably, ranging from 11 ml 0/
I sea water in mid afternoon to 4 ml/1 shortly before sunrise.
Broekhuysen (1935) found oxygen levels in Zostera beds to ap-
proach O at night and observed I. resecata swimming free of
the beds under these conditions. A measurement of pre¬
sunrise oxygen levels in bay Phyllospadix showed them to
be around 1.5 ml/1, whereas daytime oxygen levels in the
same beds were in the meighborhood of 12 ml/1.
To summarize what is known about the comparitive
habitats of I. resedata and I. montereyensis, then, it seems
that in addition to marked differences in wave action, bays
tend to be more temperature variable than the open coast
llospadix beds. The intertidal tide pools into which I.
montereyensis is sometimes washed may in turn be more
temperature variable than the bays, however.
Oxygen levels in the kelp beds do not seem to get
very low, but Broekhuysen's work indicates that I. resecata
in Zostera may have to face quite low oxygen concentrations.
I. montereyensis, on the other hand, is limitted to the open
coast and probably does not see the same low levels of oxygen
that I. resecata does. Indeed, O, concentration may be a
factor limitting the horizontal distribution of I. monter-
eyensis. Presumably oxygen levels in open coast Phyllo¬
