eight males were used in this experiment and the females
show no significant differences from the males. The least
squares regression line has a slight positive slope, but does
not differ significantly from 0. It seems, then, that weight
has little affect on time of death, at least at this
particular oxygen concentration, and that individual variation
due to factors other than body size and sex may have greater
affect on the time of death.
The results of experiments on survival at low oxygen ten-
sions are shown in figure 7. While the unexplained variation
is not small for either species, the regression slope for I.
resecata is significantly different from that of I. mon-
tereyensis suggesting that if the oxygen stress is not extreme
(tensions below about .60 ml 0/ 1 sea water), I. resecata
may enjoy a better survival rate. When the oxygen stress
is quite extreme the animals die off too soon to show a
distinction between species, as was the case in the more
extreme salinity and temperature stresses tested in previous
experiments.
Care must be taken in interpretting this data for several
reasons. First, oxygen tensions above about 2.22 ml 0,/ 1
sea water were not investigated and an extrapolation of the
regression lines to higher oxygen tensions is probably not
valid. Further, the regression lines fitted to the data are
linear. More data might reveal an exponential relationship
between LT-50 and oxygen concentration although for both
species the linear correlation is significant at the 1% level.
Finally, it must be remembered that once the test tubes were
