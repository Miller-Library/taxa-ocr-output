ACKNOWLEDGEMEN
I would like to acknowledge Robert Keever for generously
letting me use his data and Chris Harrold for being kind
enough to wade into Phyllospadix beds for me at 4:30 am.
I want to thank Kathy Dereimer for making sure I got out of
bed for early morning collecting and Nat Howe for making
so many tiresome trips to the storeroom to get materials.
I am very grateful to Mrs. Connally for letting me use so many
envelopes and just generally being such a sweetie. I very
much want to thank Dr. Lee for providing encouragement,
advice, ideas, and understanding throughout the quarter in
addition to knowing an excellent Italian restaurant in
Occidental, California. Finally, I would like to acknowledge
everyone at Hopkins Marine Station in the spring of 1973
for making the place just what it was: a great spot to spend
some time.
