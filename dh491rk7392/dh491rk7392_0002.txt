INTRODUCTION
In 1950 Menzies described the distribution of the
California Idoteid isopods and while he found several species
inhabiting open coastal situations, he only described one,
Idotea resecata, as typically being a bay inhabitant. With
eight species being described from subtidal to intertidal
levels it seemed unusual that only one of these had the
appropriateadaptations to inhabit bay localities. It was my
intent to examine the bay inhabiting I. resecata, comparing
some of its morphological and physiological adaptations
to those of one of the isopods described by Menzies as a
typical open coastal form. Idotea montereyensis was chosen
as the open coast species to be studied because of its
availability and the ease with which it could be collected.
Menzies classifies both of these species as being lower
intertidal, so variations due to differences in vertical
distribution were expected to be minimal.
In the spring, plentiful number of I. resecata live in
the canopy of the Macrocystis pyrifera found off Hopkins Mar-
ine Station in Monterey Bay, California. While the Macrocystis
is not in the intertidal zone, I. resecata may also be found
on Zostera marina which occurs intertidally at about the
O.O tidal level. In these habitats, I. resecata is presumably
exposed to less wave action than is present in a typical
open coast rocky intertidal area.
In contrast, I. montereyensis lives on the flowering plant
Phyllospadix scouleri found along the open coast at approximately
