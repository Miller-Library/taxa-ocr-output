6. Survival of I. resecata under low 0, tension as a function
of wet weight. Log survival time in minutes is plotted
against log wet weight in grams. Animals ranged in weight
from .0195 gm to .3705 gm, and survival times ranged from
20 min to 65 min. The regression line is not significantly
different from 0. Eight males and two females (denoted "F")
were used in the experiment.
7. LT-50's for I.resecata and I. montereyensis at low oxygen
tensions. LT-50 in minutes is plotted against initial O,
concentration in ml 0/1 sea water. Each point represents an
LT-50 for 10 animals. x- I. resecata, o- I. montereyensis.
The regression coefficients are significantly different at
the 1% level.
8. The left 7th pereaopod of I. montereyensis and I. resecata
in characteristic grasping positions.
