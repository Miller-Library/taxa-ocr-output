of this vertical migration, then, I. montereyensis should
perhaps not be considered an animal typical of the lower
intertidal zone.
Keever's (1973) work on I. stenops lends support to this
hypothesis. I. stenops is an Idoteid isopod which lives in
the lowest intertidal zone among Laminaria and lower
Egresia. In his study, Keever found the lowest oxygen concentration
in areas frequented by I. stenops to be 4.2 ml 0,/1 sea water,
and experiments showed that while this animal could sur-
vive in water slowly brought to.70 ml/1, it became noticably
stressed in levels below 2.8 ml/1. Both I. montereyensis and
1. resecata,however, swim normally in tubes with oxygen
concentrations down to about.90 ml/1 for close to an hour.
Evidently I. stenops is less tolerant of low oxygen concentra¬
tions than either I. resecata or I. montereyensis.
Keever never found spring temperatures in areas with
I. stenops to get above 12' C, and as might be expected,
figure 2 shows that I. stenops has a temperature toler-
ance less than that of either I. resecata or I. monter-
éyensis. At 20' C the LT-50 for I. stenops is under 9 hours,
while at a slightly higher temperature almost all I. res-
ecata and I. montereyensis studied could survive for over
23 hours.
In summary, the tolerance ranges of the animals studied
correspond to the ranges of environmental parameters for
each of their respective habitats. I. montereyensis,
living in a more temperature and salinity variable environment
