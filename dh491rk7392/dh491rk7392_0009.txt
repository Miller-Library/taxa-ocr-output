sealed the oxygen concentrations decreased with time as the
animals respired. Consequently the data show LT-50's not at
a constant oxygen concentration but rather in water which had
an initially determined concentration. Differences in oxygen
depletion rates both between the species and between differ-
ent size classes probably accounts for some of the unexÂ¬
plained variation, although the experiments shown in
figures 5 and 6 suggest that this variation is small. The
assumption is made that since the respiration rates of I.
resecata and I. montereyensis are not greatly different in
fully oxygenated water, as is shown in figure 5, the rates are
not significantly different in low oxygen water. A further
assumption is that time of death, shown not be affected much
by animal size in I. resecata at an oxygen concentration
of .42 ml 0/ 1 sea water, is not greatly affected by size at
higher oxygen tensions. Observations made during the course
of the experiment seem to bear out the assumption regarding the
independence of size and time of death although the
matter was not investigated directly at higher oxygen
concentrations. Furthermore, death did not seem to be significantly
correlated to sex or reproductive state of the females.
Morphology and Behavior.
Both isopod species studied are quite streamlined and are
strong swimmers. They can both hold on to their usual substrate
quite tightly, although some factors, such as removal of the
substrate from water appears to influence their holding
