mortality. Again, no differential mortality between sexes
or size classes was noted.
LT-50's at the various temperatures are summarized in
figure 4. For the sake of comparison this figure also
incorporates some of the data by Keever (1973) on another
Idoteid isopod, I. stenops, a lower intertidal open coast
isopod which does not migrate to higher tide levels as does
I. montereyensis. Note that the I. stenops has markedly
less tolerance to high temperature stress than either I.
resecata or I. montereyensis.

rocedure: Oxygen requirements of the isopods were investigated
in two ways. First, respiration rates in oxygen saturated,
filtered sea water were measured with a constant volume
respirometer. This information was needed to interpret the
experiments on low 0, tolerance. Eight male I. montereyensis
and nine male I. resecata were used in these experiments,
temperature being maintained constant at 15' C. Animals of
similar size for each species were used in the experiment,
ranging from about .Ol gm to about .23 gm. Second, tolerance
to low oxygen was determined. Ten individuals of each species
were used in each experiment. Nitrogen was bubbled through
a stock solution of filtered sea water for varying lengths
of time to lower the oxygen concentration. A sample was then
taken and a Winkler oxygen determination performed to measure
oxygen tension. Simultaniously twenty large test tubes
