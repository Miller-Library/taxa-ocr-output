spadix beds never reach levels quite as low as those in the
bay because of increased mixing due to heavy wave action.
Little is known regarding salinity variation in these
areas, but fresh water run-off could introduce salinity
variation where there is not adequate mixing with a large
salt water mass. Therefore bays might be expected to have
greater salinity variation than well-mixed open coast Phyllo-
padix beds. In intertidal tide pools, however, because of
both increased temperature causing high evaporation
rates and fresh water run-off, the tide-pool waters might be
quite variable in relation to salinity. On the basis of
this speculation, one might then characterize the habitat of
I. montereyensis as being more variable in terms of temperature
and salinity than that of I. resecata but more stable with
respect to ambiant oxygen levels.
Experimental results agree with this comparison of the
habitats. In short, I. montereyensis does better at high
salinity and temperature than I. resecata. However, I. resecata
appears to withstand lower O tensions than I. montereyensis.
This suggests that Menzies' original classification of the
vertical distribution of the two species is misleading.
He felt that both could be considered lower intertidal species,
suggesting they both could be expected to have the tolerances
of lower intertidal species. It has been shown, however,
that I. montereyensis has the temperature and salinity
tolerances to cope with the high variability of the intertidal
tide pools into which it is periodically washed. Because
