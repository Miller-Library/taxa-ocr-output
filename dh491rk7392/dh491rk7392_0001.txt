ABSTRACT
Idotea resecata lives primarily on bay Zostera and Macro-
cystis and is considered to be a typical bay species (Menzies,
1950). Idotea montereyensis is adapted to open coast Phyllospadix
beds and is considered to be a typical open coast species.
Both species have been labelled as lower intertidal forms.
Tolerances to heat, salinity, and survival at low oxygen
tensions were measured, and morphology of the pereaopods was
also examined. It was found that I. montereyensis had
longer LT-50's for the higher temperature and salinity
stresses, enabling it to cope with both the lower
intertidal environment of the Phyllospadix beds and also the
higher intertidal tide pools into which it is sometimes
washed. I. resecata has slightly greater abilities to deal
with low oxygen situations, enabling it to cope with
the low oxygen concentrations often found in Zostera
beds. The pereaopods of I. montereyensis seem to be more
adapted than those of I. resecata to gripping the substrate
effectively in heavy wave action on the basis of morphology.
Because I. montereyensis migrates vertically as it develops
and has the physiological tolerances to cope with the range
of environmental parameters associated with such a migration,
it is felt that to consider it only a species of the lower intertidal
is misleading.
