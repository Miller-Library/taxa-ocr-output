euryhaline, but I. montereyensis clearly survives better at
the more extreme salinities. The difference in LT-50 at
both 25% and 50% sea water is quite marked. No obvious
differential viability was noted relative to the size, sex,
or reproductive state of the females in either species tested.
Tolerance to Physical Parameters--Temperature.
Procedure: To test temperature tolerance to 15° C, 22° c, 30° c,
35° C, and 40° C, finger bowls with 200 ml of 100% sea water
were placed in heat closets in the dark at 30° C, 35° C, and 40° C,
in a dark room at 15° C, and in a darkened box at room temperature
2° C). All bowls were aerated continuously and allowed
to equilibrate to the experimental temperature for about
one hour. In a manner similar to that utilized in the
previous experiment, samples of 5 or 6 animals were introduced
into the bowls and checked hourly to determine the number
still alive. The criteria of death were the same as in the
preceeding experiment. The experiments at 15°, 30°, and 35
were replicated four times while the experiment at 40' C
was repeated only once. The data was pooled as in earlier
experiments.
Results: The pooled data is shown in figure 3. The severe
heat stress of 40° C killed all animals in too short a period
to show any distinction between the two species. At temperatures
of 30° C and 35° C I. montereyensis again shows greater survival
than I. resecata. Both species can survive temperatures of
15° C and 22° C for at least 23 hours with no significant
