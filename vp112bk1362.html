Carmel, a city of 4712 inhabitants, is located on the
California coast approximately 120 miles south of San Francisco.
The city discharges 1.1 to 1.3 million gallons a day of primary
treated effluent from an ocean outfall into that part of Carmel
Bay bounded to the north by the Carmel River and to the south
by Monastery Beach. The pipe that carries the sewage from
the Carmel treatment plant to the bay is over 2000 feet in
length, and emerges immediately subtidal in a rocky intertidal
area that receives moderately heavy surf at high tide.
The research reported herein deals with the distribution
and abundance of marine intertidal fauna in the Carmel outfall
area and was chosen due to the need for knowledge concerning
the effect of primary sewage effluent on intertidal organisms.
Recent municipal proposals to change existing conditions by
either extending the outfall pipe farther out into the bay or
developing a secondary treatment plant made this project even
more essential in that comparisons might be drawn in the future
against a baseline of present conditions. In addition, the
Carmel treatment plant has recently begun a program of heavy
chlorination of their sewage, and plans have been formulated
to increase the flow yolume of this waste by adding the effluent
from the Pebble Beach community. Present conditions of the
intertidal animal life around the outfall must now be known
to calculate the probable effects of these changes, and to
help determine the most advisable future course of action for
sewage treatment for this growing coastal community.
Reports in the literature have dealt with the effects of
sewage outfalls on deep water marine environments (e.g. Reish, 1959).
Oceanographic studies prepared for the Californians Against
Pollution concentrated on similar problems in the Santa Monica
Bay area of California in 1956. In addition, these same topics
have been discussed at various symposiums including those held
at the University of California at Berkeley in 1969, and in
Washington, D. C. in 1966. However, little has been done
researching the effects of sewage outfalls on the distribution
of intertidal animals. Virtually nothing has been done in the
Carmel area. The research on the Carmel outfall reported in
this paper will therefore be concerned with intertidal faunal
distribution and abundance as a possible parameter for measuring
sewage pollution.
The research first involved mapping the survey area in
Carmel Bay, as well as the currents affecting the outfall
region. Knowledge of current movements was then used to
determine locations where chemical analyses of the water would
provide more detailed information concerning the dilution of
the effluent and its area of influence. This in turn determined
where transects would be laid so as to best calculate the
distribution and abundance of the fauna. As a result of the
foregoing research, a test organism apparently affected by the
effluent was selected, and its mortality rate in varying
concentrations of sewage was tested.

METHODS
Mapping the Study Ares
A map of the coastline from Mission Point to Point <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lobos : Exact'>Lobos,</span>
a state park reserve (Figure 1), was obtained from the California Dept.
of Parks and Recreation, and shows the general study area in
Carmel Bay, California. In addition, the area immediately
adjacent to the outfall, an area approximately 325 feet by
150 feet is shown in Figure 2.
Current Studies
Current studies were carried out on two different days.
May 11 and May 25, 1970. On each day 12 plastic bottles
that were color coded and filled with fresh water were used
to show current movement. On the first day, the 12 bottles
were placed in a line parallel to the shore from a point
approximately 2000 feet south of the outfall to a point
nearly 500 feet north of the outfall. The bottles were
dropped from a boat about 1000 feet offshore at regular
intervals of 10 seconds along this line and their initial
position in the water was marked with fluorescein dye. On the
second day, the 12 bottles were placed in a line close to where
the previous pattern of bottles had last been sighted. This
line began about 260 feet off from the center of Monastery
Beach and extended well beyond where the first series of bottles
had been located, nearly 5600 feet offshore towards Cypress
Point. These bottles were laid at 15 second intervals and had
fluorescein dye packets attached to them. On both days the
drift bottles were followed for at least two hours, and their
positions were plotted from observation points on the shore.
Inshore currents near the outfall region were studied
with 20 and 40 gram fluorescein dye packets on May 11, 1970.
The visual dispersion of the dye with the currents was recorded
at both low and high tide over a total period of seven hours.
Chemical Analyses
Chemical analyses included tests for phosphates, nitrites,
nitrates, dissolved oxygen, chlorine, and hydrogen sulfide.
The methods used for nutrients, Cl,, and 0, analyses are those
outlined by Strickland and Parsons, 1965. Salinity was measured
with a pocket refractometer calibrated against standard Copenhagen
water. A portable pH meter was used for pH readings, and a
standard mercury-filled centigrade thermometer for temperature
values. Heavy metals were tested using a Perkin-Elmer Model
303 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. All tests except
those for heavy metals were made at 10 stations ranging from
approximately one mile south of the outfall at south Point
Lobos (Station J) and about 4000 feet south of the outfall at
north Point Lobos (Station I) all the way to 2000 feet north
of the outfall at Mission Point (Station B, see Figure 6).
Testing was also carried out at the Carmel treatment plant
itself (StationA). Heavy metals were measured only in the
effluent at the plant. All field testing was accomplished at
the lowest tide on three different days, May 7, 13, and 28
1970. The low tides on those days were -1.2 feet, 0.4 feet,
and 0.2 feet, respectively.
Faunal Distribution
Following the chemical analyses, a qualitative stud
of faunal distribution was accomplished by laying out transect
lines from higher high water (43.0 - 16.0 feet) perpendicular
to the shore 70-130 feet in length to about mean lower low
water (0.0 feet). All organisms that could be seen one foot
to either side of the line were identified. These transects
were taken along the shore at the same locations where chemical
analyses had been made earlier (cf. Figures 6 and 9).
The qualitative results obtained from the transect studies
were later further quantified. To accomplish this, five typical
types of areas were chosen in eight of the transects and sampled
for numbers and kinds of organisms. These eight stations
corresponded to transects 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (cf. Figure 9).
The characteristics of these areas were as follows:
Area Type I - +4.0 to 15.0 feet, horizontal, inshore,
direct sun, splashed at high tide, very
little plant cover.
ype II - 43.0 to 44.0 feet, horizontal, direct sun,
Area T
inshore, medium amount of plant cover.
Area Type III - 13.0 to 44.0 feet, horizontal, direct sun,
standing water, 20-40 feet from shore,
heavy plant cover.
Area Type IV-
12.0 to 43.0 feet, vertical, inshore,
facing wave action.
Area Type V -
+2.0 to 13.0 feet, vertical, 10-20 feet
farther out from shore than Area Type IV
protected from much of the wave action.
Five quarter meter squares were placed along each of the eight
transects at points which had characteristics similar to those
outlined above. All the macroscopic fauna observable within
each of the squares was counted with the aid of a hand counter.
Diversity indices were later computed on a Wang calculator by
following the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener formulae as outlined
by Cox, 1967.
Limpet Toxicity
The limpets <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea digitalis : Exact'>Acmaea digitalis</span> and A. scutum were arrarentl;
affected by the effluent, and so were chosen for toxicity tests.
To minimize variability due to size, tidal height, and location,
160 individuals were all collected at Mission Point at the same
tidal heigth of 43.0 to + 4.0 feet for A. digitalis and from
0.O to 41.0 feet for A. scutum. All the individuals taken
were 1 to 2 cm in length. Ten limpets of each species were
placed in a series of shallow plastic dishes filled to the top
with sea water containing 2, 10, 20, 50, and 100% Carmel sewage
Sea water controls were also utilized. Both chlorinated and
unchlorinated sewage for these experiments was collected from
the Carmel treatment plant. The dishes had a barrier placed
around the top edge so that the limpets could not escape the
test solutions. Temperature was kept constant at 14 centigrade
by emmersing the plastic dishes in a cold water bath. The
limpets were given ample space, and were left outside to be
exposed to the natural light regime. The salinity loss due
to the inclusion of the fresh water sewage was approximated
in the controls for each concentration by using an appropriate
volume of distilled water in the control dishes. The mortality
rate of the limpets was recorded at eight time intervals covering
a span of 32 hours. The controls were examined over a total
period of 53 hours. Death was established if the limpet did
not attach to the dish and its tentacles did not respond to touch.
RESULT
Current Studies
The currents recorded on May 11, 1970 are seen in Figure 3.
These 12 drift bottles moved in an uniform direction southward
towards Monastery Beach. The second group of 12 bottles were
laid in the line close to where the first group of bottles
were last sighted. This study took place on May 25, 1970,
and as Figure 4 shows, these bottles moved in a circular
pattern and ended up approximately 100 feet offshore at the
north end of Monastery Beach. The compass readings taken
from shore positions for these two groups of bottles are
shown in Table la and 1b, respectively. Table 2 gives the
dates and locations of bottle recovery. The recovery rate for
the bottles is high, especially for the second current study.
The data from these two studies gives evidence to suggest
that the effluent is moving in a southerly direction towards
Monastery Beach, and might even be reaching north Point Lobos
below Whaler's Cove about 4000 feet south of the outfall. One
drift bottle from the first study was found about 100 feet off
this north Point Lobos shore.
An examination of the inshore currents tends to support
the evidence of strong southward currents. Figure 5 indicates
the movement of fluorescein dye laid as packets near the mouth
of the outfall at low and high tide on May 11, 1970. It was
quite noticeable that part of the effluent moved only 100 feet
north before joining the main movement of water southward.
There is also a heavy wash of effluent directly behind the
outfall which moves to the southern end of the rocks of the
outfall area, a distance of about 600 feet.
From these current studies it appears that for this period
the effluent was moving in a southerly direction towards
Monastery Beach, and because of circular patterns at that point,
the effluent may linger in this area. The drift bottles were
set about 1000 feet offshore so anything plaeed in the water
up to this distance would probably move in a similar pattern.
Chemical Ana
ses
The locations where chemical tests were undertaken are
indicated in Figure 6. These stations were selected as a
result of the current studies with Stations D and F expected
to show the greatest amount of effluent contact. Stations C
and E were expected to show less sewage pollution than the
above stations. Station B at Mission Point approximately
2000 feet north of the outfall was believed to be comparable
to Station H at the north end of Monastery Beach approximately
2000 feet south of the outfall.
The results of the chemical tests are graphed in Figures
7a-7h. Note that the curves are similar in frequently reaching
maximum values at specific stations for H,S, PO, NO., Cl,, and
temperature. The 0,, salinity, and NO tests show the exact
inverse pattern where collectively their minimum values are
often reached at specific stations. This correlation was
clarified by ranking the values obtained, giving the station
with the highest value for a chemical test a ranking of 1, the
station with the second highest value a ranking of 2, etc.
If two stations had the same value for an analyses, they were
given the same ranking. Ranking was plotted against station
and Figure 8 shows a marked similarity between the widely
different types of chemical tests. There appears to be a
differential dispersion of the effluent with Stations D, E,
F, and G receiving the most contact with the sewage. This
information supports the current study evidence of the southward
movement of the effluent.
The sewage from the Carmel outfall is of domestic origin,
and therefore, pH readings and heavy metal concentrations were
not expected to be extreme. At the outfall, the water was
acidic with a reading of 6.6. But 50 feet to either side of
the outfall the pH readings were neutral at 7.0 and remained
so the rest of the way along the shore both to the north and
south. Six metals were tested for with the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer. These were copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury,
lead, and chromium. Only zinc and copper appeared in appreciable
amounts, snd neither was very much greater than normal concentrations
in sea water.
Although these chemical tests were of a short term nature,
it is importanit to note that the results show a similar pattern
which correlates to the currents in the area. There is also
a relatively low dilution of some of the fundamental components
of the sewage, such as hydrogen sulfide, at distances over 1000
feet away from the outfall.
Faunal Distribution
The locations of the transects are displayed in Figure 9.
These locations were selected in areas where current studies
and chemical tests had been achieved so correlations would be
evident. Observations from the transect studies are graphically
represented in Figures 10-19. Certain species are obviously
scarce or lacking from transects near the outfall, e.g. the
larger limpets, starfish, and sea urchins. Figure 20 is a
summary of this transect material and records the relative
distribution and abundance of the fauna, and exhibits those
species which can be said to be evidently affected by the
effluent, e.g. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>Mytilus californianus,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mitella polymerus : Exact'>Mitella polymerus,</span>
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Balanus glandula : Exact'>Balanus glandula,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Chthamalus : Exact'>Chthamalus</span> spp., and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tetraclita squamosa rubescens : Exact'>Tetraclita squamosa
rubescens.</span>
These results were supported by the data gathered in the
distribution squares study. The faunal distribution studies
were done at eight stations along the shoreline corresponding
to transects 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (cf. Figure 9).
Tables 3-7 show the population counts from each of five types
of areas (described on pp. 4-5) at each of the eight stations.
Note the decrease in the number of species, the ratio of live
to dead barnacles, and the diversity indices in the outfall
region (Stations 2-6). The larger limpets such as <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea limatula : Exact'>Acmaea
limatula,</span> A. scutum, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. pelta,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Diodora : Exact'>Diodora</span> spp., and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lottia gigantea : Exact'>Lottia gigantea</span>
are scarce or lacking in this region. The relative abundance
and distribution of tunicate species are tabulated in Table 8.
Again the lack of species in Stations 2-6 is very noticeable.
Limpet Toxicity
Figures 2la-j are concerned with the LT50 experiments
(time required for 50% of the population to die) for Acmaea
digitalis and A. scutum. It is apparent that up to concentrations
of 20% sewage, chlorine significantly reduces the LT50. The
LT50 are compiled for the different concentrations of sewage
in Table 9, and range from 32 hours for 2% unchlorinated sewage
to 4 hours for 100% chlorinated sewage. Although these tests
were not conclusive due to the small sample size, it is evident
adult limpet populations are affected quickly by sewage effluent.
16
DISCUSSTON
It was evident at the time of the mapping and current
studies that there existed a strong southward current from the
mouth of the outfall. The current extended down to Monastery
Beach, with several drift bottles ending up about 100 feet north
of this beach and approximately 2000 feet south of the outfall.
There is also evidence currents may be carrying the effluent
as far as north Point Lobos below Whaler's Cove about 4000 feet
south of the outfall. If the effluent were to reach this area,
it would tend to remain there because of the circular currents
near Monastery Beach shown to exist in the second current study.
The high recovery rate of drift bottles, nearly 60% within two
weeks after the second study, shows the effluent is not moving
out to sea, and thus, may have an even larger affect on the
marine intertidal fauna within Carmel Bay, especially to the
south of the Carmel outfall.
In the immediate area of the outfall the effluent appeare
to wash straight back into the beach area directly behind the
pipe. The area to the north of the pipe for an estimated 100
feet received a heavy wash of effluent, which eventually joined
the larger southward movement of water. The extreme north end
of the outfall rocks and the area about 160 feet south of the
outfall were not as heavily washed with effluent as the rest
of the immediate outfall area, suggesting that currents may
bypass Stations C and E (cf. Figure 6).
The apparent dilution of effluent from the mouth of the
outfall southward is not large. At a point approximately 600
feet south of the Carmel outfall, nitrites had been diluted
only 58% and hydrogen sulfide 69%. The area 250 feet north
of the outfall at the end of the immediate outfall area gave
test results often comparable to areas much farther away from
the outfall, such as Station B at Mission Point to the north,
and Station I at north Point Lobos to the south. Also from the
chemical tests, it is evident Station E 160 feet south of the
outfall does not receive as much effluent as Station F about
600 feet south of the outfall.
The results of the chemical analyses were not conclusive
and must be repeated at a later date for confirmation. However,
the data strongly suggests the movement of the effluent with
the currents southward towards the Monastery Beach and Point
Lobos areas, where it apparently may stay for some time.
The chemical analyses definitely indicated some areas in
the region of the outfall were receiving larger doses of effluent
than others. This information aided in selection of the transect
locations. It was immediately evident from our transects that
near and to the south of the outfall had fewer animal species
than areas farther removed from the outfall. For example,
certain species of molluscs, crabs, starfich, tunicates, and
barnacles were scarce or entirely lacking in transects 3-6 where
physical parameters denoted conditions capable of supporting
such populations. Figure 19 shows this evidence very clearly.
Unfortunately, certain species such as annelids were left out
of this study due to the difficulty in collecting and identifying
such small organisms. The transects were examined on two different
days in order to increase the accuracy of the observations.
It is not possible to entirely eliminate sampling errors
in the distributional studies, but attempts were made to
minimize these errors as much as possible. Tunicates and
porifera presented a difficult problem because the numbers
of individuals in colonies could not be easily counted. Therefore,
only their presence or absence was included in the distribution
samples, and they were excluded from diversity index calculations.
For quantitative studies, five typical areas were selected
at each of the eight stations with tidal height, exposed surface,
and wave action approximated as closely as possible for each
type of area. The results showed a clear gradient for the
total number of species in each type of area for the eight stations
with the greatest numbers occurring in the control areas and
decreaing towards the outfall. There is no such gradient for
the total number of individuals in an area. This may be
accounted for by the fact that some species, i.e. <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea scabra : Exact'>Acmaea scabra</span>
and <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Anthopleura elegantissima : PartialExact'>Anthopleura elegantissima may</span> be doing better in the outfall
region due to decreased competition from other species. The
competition between Acmaea scabra and A. digitalis has been
well documented by Haven in a 1966 Monterey Bay area study.
The diversity indices used in this study are dependent
on sample size and range too widely to support a definite
gradient from control to outfall area. Still, it is clear
that for Area Types I-IV (Tables 5-8), the diversity indices
for the outfall Station 4 are considerably lower than for the
areas farthest away from the outfall at Stations 1 and 9. This
is not true for Area Type V which is at the highest tidal height
examined. One possible reason for this apparent contradiction
is simply that an area five feet above mean lower low water
is often out of the water, and hence does not receive sustained
exposure to the sewage effluent. Similar results for the
relationship between tidal height and a diversity indices
gradient was noted by Clearman (1970) in his study of the
distribution and abundance of microfauna at varying distances
from the Pacific Grove, California outfall.
The general pattern of distribution seen was likewise
reflected in the number of live barnacles in the different
distribution squares. A barnacle was assumed to be living
if the shell was filled with the organism. Empty shells
were noted so that the per cent of live barnacles in the
distribution squares could be tabulated (Tables 5-9). There
is definitely a greater ratio of live to dead barnadles in
the areas farthest away from the outfall region. A possible
explanation for this is that barnacles are filter feeders
and therefore, come into significantly large contact with
the sewage in the water. The distribution patterns of other
filter feeders such as Mytilus californianus and Mitella
polymerus tend to support this idea in that there was a lack
of clustering, gereral smaller size, and looser attachment
at Stations 3 and 4 (cf. Welsh, 1970). Tunicates, still
another group of filter feeders, are also conspicuously absent
from Stations 2-6 where overhanging rocks and tide pools would
seem to provide perfectly habitable areas for this group.
A phylum apparently affected by the effluent is <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mollusca : Exact'>Mollusca,</span>
especially the limpets. It was quite noticeable in the outfall
region that the limpets were often attached very loosely to the
rocks and could be picked off by hand, especially A. digitalis.
The rocks were covered with <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia : Exact'>Hildenbrandia,</span> an encrusting alga,
and a diatomaceus slime which may account for the decreased
attachment strength of limpets in the area. In Stations 2-4
in the outfall region, the A. digitalis were very small and
almost all were under 2mm in length. In the areas farthest
removed from the outfall, they often reached a length of nearl,
2 cm. Small limpets were also found in these areas far to the
north and the south, but always along with the larger A. digitalis.
If it were assumed these small <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea : Exact'>Acmaea</span> were very young, then it
may be hypothesized that the effluent is affecting some adult
stage of the organism rather than a developmental stage. Although
Acmaea scabra was also smaller in the proximity of the outfall,
it seemed to be able to attach far more securely to rocks than
A. digitalis. It was observed in field studies that <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. scabra"</span>
scalloped shell conformed closely to its position on the irregular
rock surface. This may account for its stronger attachment to rocks.
The larger limpets such as Lottia gigantea, Diodora spp.,
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Acmaea scutum : Exact'>Acmaea scutum,</span> A. pelta, and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. limatula</span> were scarce or completely
missing from Stations 2-4, although quite abundant at other stations.
More detailed work is obviously necessary to back up the very
qualitative statements about attachment strength and shell size.
The observations about limpets examined in the distributional
studies led to the LT50 experiments with Acmaea digitalis and
A. scutum. While the sample sizes were much too small to be
conclusive, toxicity tests on A. digitalis and A. scutum showed
that these two species seemed definitely affected by sewage
concentrations as low as 2% within the relatively short time
of 32 hours. With this knowledge, the concentration of sewage
should be lowered even further in future experiments. Another
clear point from Figures 20-22 is the increased lethality of
the sewage after chlorination in concentrations up to 20%.
Above this level, sewage without chlorination appeared to be
just as lethal. This suggests that chlorine may be lethal to
limpets in the outfall area where sewage concentrations are
well below 20%. A differing rate of death between A. digitalis
and A. scutum was not discernible, and salinity reduction was
not the apparent cause for the high mortality rate.
The manner of death for these limpets may be of some
consequence in designating how the sewage kills these organisms.
The dead limpets in almost all cases had thrust their shells
back to expose their gills, often with enough force to tear
their mantle. Two limpets that were observed to die in 100%
distilled water did not contort in this manner.
It is essential to note that for 2% unchlorinated sewage
concentrations, the LT50 for these limpets was approximately
32 hours. Because these limpets are affected quickly in sewage
of relatively low concentrations, <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Acmaea : PartialExact'>Acmaea may</span> provide an excellent
test organism for future research dealing with the effect of
sewage effluent on intertidal marine organisms. One such possible
experiment may include the placement of rocks with attached
limpets at varying distances from the outfall to thst their
mortality rate within their natural environment.

SUMMARY
This research project examined the effects of primary
treated effluent on the distribution and abundance of marine
intertidal fauna in a portion of Carmel Bay, California.
During the time of the current studies, the effluent was
moving south from the outfall and appeared to remain in the
Monastery Beach area due to circular currents. The sewage
was not moving straight out to sea.
Damage in the outfall area can be seen in the form of
distribution patterns and are reflected in the diversity indices
for specific types of areas. The distribution patterns suggest
that Mytilus californianus (California mussel), Mitella polymerus
(Gooseneck barnacle), Balanus glandula, Chthamalus spp., Tetraclita
squamosa rubescens, Acmaea spp., <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pisaster ochraceus : Exact'>Pisaster ochraceus,</span> <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pagurus : Exact'>Pagurus</span> spp.,
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Haliotis cracherodii : PartialExact'>Haliotis cracherodii may</span> be good intertidal indicators of
and
sewage pollution.
Toxicity tests on Acmaea digitalis and A. scutum suggest
that at low concentrations of sewage, Cl, may be responsible
for much of the lethality of the sewage. However, Cl, does
not account for the entire toxicity of any concentration of
sewage
The research outlined in this paper suggests further
investigations are necessary to confirm present information
about current and effluent movement in Carmel Bay, the toxicity
of sewage due to Cl,, the toxicity of other sewage components,
distribution and diversity patterns as measurable parameters
of sewage pollution, and the development of other types of
indicators of sewage pollution.

The 12 bottles were laid in a line that extended from 200 feet off
Monastery Beach towards Cypress Point, a total distance of about
5600 feet. Their approximate travel routes toward the north
end of Monastery Beach and the times of their first compass
readings are indicated. The bottles were followed from a point
on the shore (Ref. Pt. 3).
