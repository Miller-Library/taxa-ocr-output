Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata

interface where evaporation results in a decrease in temper¬
ature.
The other possible explanation is that a sharp peak
occurs closer to high tide and was not detected due to the
length of interval between observations. This possibility
seems unlikely because it is the presence of the peak rather
than its absence which is the aberration. However, a study
on short-term fluctuations where data were collected every
15 minutes for one and one-half hours indicated that signifi¬
cant changes in distribution do occur in times as short as
45 minutes.
The effects of tide on L. scutulata appear quite variable.
These effects depend on roughness of surf, degree of exposure
of a pool to the surf, and even the particular geometry of
the pool. Day and night, on the other hand, affect all the
pools in the same way. There is less danger of desiccation
at night and more during the day. When the gross population
distribution data for all four pools are combined as in Figure
5, the interpool variability results in a loss of obvious
tidal effects. At the same time, the effects of day and
night become even more obvious.
It was hypothesized above that L. scutulata may move to
the interface during the late afternoon when heat from the
sun would increase the temperature of the pool to an un¬
comfortable level. This could occur if the pool did not
receive any water during a high tide occurring during the
day and if the pool were shallow enough to allow a significant
