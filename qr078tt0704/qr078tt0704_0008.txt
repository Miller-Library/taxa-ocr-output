tides in the afternoon at both pools. At Pool 2 this represents
from 71-82% of the population. At Pool 4 it is from 23-50%.
Figure 7 is a comparison of the number of individuals
at the interface of the pools. As in Figure 6, peaks occur
at low tides in Pool 2. Similarly, the peaks at low tides
occurring during the day are much higher than for those occur¬
ring during the night. This represent from 43-61% of the
total population. As might be expected, both numbered and
dotted subpopulations exhibit the same behavior. At Pool 4
there is no clear pattern of movement to the interface and
the number found there is very low in comparison with the
total population.
The number of snails observed in cracks is shown in
Figure 8. At Pool 2 movement to this category does not
show any regularity, though there are slight increases in
the crack population at high and low points in the tidal cycle.
At Pool 4 there appears to be an initial correlation between
the crack population and the tidal cycle with a large peak,
65% of the total, occurring at the first high high tide and
another, 43% of the total, occurring just before the second
high high tide.
Figure 9 compares numbered individuals found on the bot¬
tom and side of Pool 4. Most of the numbered snails were
submerged during the observation period. In general, the
bottom population increases at ascending and high tides.
Although the sample size is small and fluctuations represent
only a few individuals, a constant population was under
