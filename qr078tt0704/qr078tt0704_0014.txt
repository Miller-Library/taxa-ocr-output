Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata

heavily weight the number in the Out plus Interface category.
Second, the population was greatly disturbed by marking them.
Removal or perhaps nail polish itself could have induced
abnormal behavior or triggered various general responses
to disturbance, e.g. movement to cracks for protection.
Third, by significantly reducing the total population in
Pools 2 and 4, intraspecific interactions may have been
disrupted, resulting in a change of behavior.
It is also possible that the bias lies with the first
study. During the last study, migration was seen to occur
quickly. Short-term fluctuations in population size in a
given pool due to migration can influence vertical distribuÂ¬
tion. For example, Pool 4 is connected by water to another
pool, which can act as a source of In Pool snails. It would
not be necessary for the snails to move into Pool 4 from the
outside; they could just enter without leaving the water.
By not observing a constant population in one pool, migration
effects may introduce large errors.
One of the most interesting aspects of monitoring indiv-
idual movement is the sequence of movements observed. There
are two important things to be noted in the plots of the
numbered individuals. In general, they exhibit the same
movement pattern as the total population. This is seen best
in Pool 2. However, not all individuals conform;
there is a rhythmic cycle which the population follows but
at the same time there are individual fluctuations depend-
ent upon the recent history of a particular individual.
