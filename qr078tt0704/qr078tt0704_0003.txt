Materials and Methods
A photographic sampling technique was used. A one-half
meter square quadrat, divided into one-hundred 5 cm x 5 cm
squares, was placed over a pool in a stadardized position. A
photograph was then taken on Ecktachrome64 color positive
film using a Nikon F2AS camera and either a 105 mm or a 55 mm
Nikkor macro lens. To minimize parallax the photograph was
taken from the same position each time. At night a Vivitar
292 electronic strobe with a duration of approximately
0.OOl seconds was used as a light source. Slides were
projected on a screen with a Kodak slide projector using a
Kodak Ektanar zoom lens. Counts were made from the projected
image.
The photographic sampling technique was chosen for two
reasons. First, it minimized disturbance of the snails and
the area, especially in terms of exposure to light during the
night. Second, it recorded distribution at a point in time
rather than over the period of time necessary for observations
by eye. While replicate counts of the slides significantly
differed between the two investigators, their combined counts
give an error of less than 6% at the 95% confidence level.
A possible problem with the method is the inability to
resolve small snails, biasing the study towards the behavior
of larger individuals.
White fingernail polish was used to mark snails with
