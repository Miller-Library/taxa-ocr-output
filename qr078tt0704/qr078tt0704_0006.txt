regular peaks at descending tides during the second observa¬
tion period. When the data for all the pools are combined,
what appears to be regular movement out of the pool at night
and into the pool during the day is apparent. See Figure 5.
In order to follow the movements of individuals, all
snails were removed from the vicinities of Pools 2 and 4.
The total populations of these pools were approximately 130
and 150 respectively. Ten snails selected from the Pool 2
population were numbered 1 through 10. Fifteen were numbered
from the population in Pool 4. In addition, twenty snails
from each pool were marked with a white spot on the tip of
the shell.
Labeled snails were returned to their respective pools.
Observations were made over a 53 hour period at major points
in the tidal cycle and the midpoints between them starting
four hours after the snails were returned to their pools.
Four categories were used to score the position of
individuals at Pool 2. In Pool signifies thoseindividuals
totally submerged, as before. Interface signifies those found
at or within 1-2 cm above the air-water interface. Snails
at the edge of the pool with their shells protruding out of
the water were also included in this category. Out signifies
those individuals not within the normal confines of the pool
and more than 2 cm from the edge of the water. Crack is a
separate category, not exclusive of the others and represent¬
ing snails found residing in cracks inside or outside of
the pool. The same categories were also used for Pool 4
