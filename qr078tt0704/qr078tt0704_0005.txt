represents the population size. Notes on the amount of
splash and wash throughout the observation period were only
collected during observation period two.
Three generalizations can be made about the fluctuation
in percent Out of Pool. These hold for all pools and both
observation periods. First, there is consistently a large
percentage of snails Out of Pool during descending tides at
night. Second, there is consistently a small percentage Out
of Pool during daytime low tides. Third, more snails tend
to be Out of Pool during the night than during the day. Large
percentages are also frequently found, but not consistently,
Out of Pool at ascending and high tides. They are seldom
found at daytime descending tides.
Each pool has its own pattern of fluctuations. The
snails in Pool 1 come out of the pool with the receding tide
at night and stay out. Most have returned to the pool by
the first daytime low or receding tide.
Pool 2 snails show similar behavior except that a small
percentage migrate into the pool at the nighttime low only to
come out again as the tide comes in. During the second
observation period a very interesting aberration occurs when
the percent Out of Pool peaks sharply at the afternoon
ascending tide. Pool 3 snails exhibit behavior very similar
to that of snails in Pool 2 during the second observation
period; however, it is less regular. Pool 4 shows the most
aberrant behavior. Distribution fluctuates with little
regularity during the first observation period and with
