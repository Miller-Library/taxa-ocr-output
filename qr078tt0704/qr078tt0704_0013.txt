interface or elsewhere?
In Pool 4, the majority of the marked population was
in cracks during the first high high tide. Movement into and
out of the cracks then showed a rhythmicity associated with
the tide; however, during subsequent high high tides a
decrease in the peak number and a shift towards ascending
tides occurred. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the
snails seek cracks during high tides as cracks are protected
areas which afford shelter from wave shock. Hence, the
rhythmic movement described above may be a general response
to disturbance, anticipating rough conditions. Removing
the snails, marking them, and replacing them may have
provided this disturbance. Since it was not very rough
during the period of observation, the rhythmic response
eventually damped out and "normal" behavior resumed.
The general pattern of movement observed in the study
with marked individuals, i.e. an increase in the Out plus
Interface population at low tides and a corresponding
decrease at high tides, is different from that observed
in the first study. There are several possible explanations
for this difference.
The results obtained in the last study may be biased
for any of three reasons. First, an increase in the number
of individuals at the interface was noticed at low tide.
Since it was calm, it is possible that increased pool tempÂ¬
erature during the day induced them to go to the interface
to cool off, i.e. air conditioner hypothesis. This would
