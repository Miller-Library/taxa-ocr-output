geography providing different degrees of exposure to incoming
tides were studied. In each area two pools were observed.
See Figures 1 and 2.
Area I is located on the north side of the Point on a
flat, horizontal rock surface. There are numerous large rocks
in the lower intertidal region which act as a break and
greatly lessen the impact of waves at high tides. Waves tend
to roll over the pools, not crash over them. Area II is on
the west shore of the Point and is exposed to much stronger
waves then Area I. The pools are on the seaward edge of a
horizontal plateau. They receive much spray and splash at
high tides.
Pools 1 and 2, located in Area I,are connected at high
tides by a narrow channel which fills with water. Pools 3
and 4, in Area II, are adjacent and separated by a large crack.
Pool 4 is connected with another pool at one end. All pools
are granite, covered with a thin film of algae. Macroscopic
algae is found only in Pool 1 which has two small bunches
of Rhodoglossum affine. There are no rocks or sediment in
the pools and their water is not turbid.
The pools vary greatly in depth. Pool 2 is the shallowÂ¬
est with a maximum depth of 3 cm. Pool 1 is the deepest with
a maximum depth of 8 cm. Pools 3 and 4 have intermediate
depths of 5 cm and 7 cm respectively.
Two studies were carried out in Areas I and II. The
first consisted of two 60 hour observations of gross
population movement. The second was a 53 hour investigation
