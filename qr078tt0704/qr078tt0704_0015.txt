Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata
Merchant, Noroian
Summary
1.) Fluctuations in the vertical distribution of Littorina
scutulata in tide pools were observed at Muscle Point.
Pacific Grove, California.
2.)
L. scutulata appear to move into and out of tide pools
as a function of the tidal cycle.
This behavior is modified by the day-night cycle.
3.)
4.)
The outward movement is positively correlated with
dampness and negatively correlated with wave shock.
The actual pattern of the in-out migration in each pool
5.)
is complex and dependent on a large number of environ¬
mental variables which are not yet fully understood.
The reasons for the in-out migration are still not known.
6.)
There are some indications: Movement into the pool and
also into cracks seems to offer protection against
wave shock; movement to the interface during the day
may be a mechanism to regulate temperature.
The night¬
time migration from in pool areas, where algae are
abundant, to out of pool areas, where algae appear
scarce, is not easily explicable.
Individual behavior shows a general agreement with
7.)
gross population behavior, but deviations were noted.
