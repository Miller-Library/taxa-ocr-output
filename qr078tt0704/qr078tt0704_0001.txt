Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata
Merchant, Noroian
Introduction
The small checkered periwinkle, Littorina scutulata
(Gould, 1849), is prevalent in the upper intertidal zone of
the California coast. It is found to inhabit tidepools as
well as cracks and rock faces in this zone.
Previous work on movement and migration of L. scutulata
is not abundant. Hewatt (1937), demonstrated negative photo-
taxis in this species. North (1954), observed that differ-
ences in the degree of exposure to wave action appear to
influence distribution of the animal within intertidal zones.
Glynn (1965), further observed that vertical movements in
the Balanus-Endocladia zone are made with the rising and
falling tides, upward movement coinciding with the advancing
tide.
Preliminary field observations of L. scutulata in tide-
pools suggested the existence of rhythmicity in migration
into and out of these pools. The purpose of this study was
to obtain a clearer picture of vertical distribution in
tidepools over time and to look for possible factors influÂ¬
encing this aspect of behavior.
Study Areas
Observations in the field were carried out at Mussel
Point, Pacific Grove, California. Two areas of differing
