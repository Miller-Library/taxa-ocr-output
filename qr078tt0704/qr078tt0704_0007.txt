with the exception that In Pool was divided into two sub¬
categories: Bottom, for those found at the extreme depths
of the pool, 4.5-6.0 cm below the surface, and Side, for
those occurring between the interface and 4.5 cm under
the water.
The observation period lasted from June 1-3, 1978. The
weather was unusually calm. It was overcast both days
except for late afternoon of the first day and most of the
afternoon of the second day. There was little wind and the
surf was calm. Although it was a spring tide period, the
pools received little spray or wash except at high high tide.
All snails remained in their respective areas except for
two of the numbered ones in Pool 2 which were lost. Signif¬
icant migration of marked individuals occurred during the
observation period. 34% moved from their pool to nearby
pools or cracks. After 50 hours, 10 individuals from Pool 2
had migrated to Pool 1. Similarly, 6 individuals moved
from Pool 4 into the pool contiguous with it. Some back and
forth movement was also observed in both areas. An influx
of unlabeled animals was also observed. A maximum of 11 and
40 unmarked snails were found in Pools 2 and 4, respectively.
In Figures 6-9, the number of L. scutulata found at
different areas at each pool are compared with the tidal
and diurnal cycles.
Figure 6 shows the number of snails at the interface
plus those out of the pool. In general, peak numbers occur
during low tide periods. The highest peaks occur at low
