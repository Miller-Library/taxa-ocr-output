Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata

rise in temperature. It has been observed that there is a
significant temperature differential between the pool, inter-
face, and surrounding rock. The temperature of Pool 2 at the
interface was found to be 6° C less than the pool or sur¬
rounding rock in the late afternoon on a warm day when the
sun was out for only a few hours. This idea, that the snails
use the interface as an air conditioner at times of heat
stress, finds support in observations of individual movement.
There is a significant increase in the number of snails at
the interface during the late afternoon in Pool 2 which has
a maximum depth of 3 cm. This pattern is not seen in Pool 4
which has a maximum depth of 7 cm and a lower pool temperature
than Pool 2. These observations are not conclusive. More
information on response to heat in L. scutulata and temp-
erature fluctuations of pools is needed.
It has been noted in Pool 4 that some individuals tend
to go to the bottom of the pool at times correlated with high
tide. At Pool 2 this is not so apparent. Pool 4 is exposed
to much greater wave shock at high tide than Pool 2 and it
is possible that snails either seek the depths of the pool
for protection or that they become dislodged during high
tide and are sent to the bottom of the pool. In order to
better understand this phenomenon more must be learned about
the ability of L. scutulata to hold on during wave shock.
Other questions in this regard are: How fast do dislodged
snails recover and attach themselves? Does attachment to
the bottom provide greater protection than attachment at the
