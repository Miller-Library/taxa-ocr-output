Results
The first 60 hour study was done April 28-30, 1978;
the second was done May 16-18. The two studies were per-
formed 18 days apart in efforts to separate the tidal and
diel components of the changes in L. scutulata distribution.
The weather and surf conditions were also different. The
first study period was balmy and overcast until late afternoon.
The surf was mild. The second study period was clear and warm
but the surf was high, calming down slightly the second day.
The fluctuations in population distribution were
monitored between two categories, In Pool and Out of Pool.
In Pool indicates snails which are completely submerged.
The Out of Pool category includes snails completely out of
water and at the air-water interface. These categories
were selected because fluctuations between them appear to be
the sharpest change in behavior which the snails exhibit.
Large fluctuations in both distribution and total
population size of L. scutulata were observed in all of the
pools during both observation periods. The results for the
individual pools are presented in Figures 3 and 4. The
percent of the population Out of Pool is shown by the solid
line. The majority of the individuals in the Out of Pool
classification were found at the interface. The dashed line
