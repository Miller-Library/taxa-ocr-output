Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata

observation.
In general, individual movement appears to be the same
as that of the larger population. This can be seen most
clearly in Pool 2. See Figures 10 and 11, where the movement
of individuals is shown and compare with other figures.
The same picture for Pool 4 is not as clear.
There is much
more variability in individual movement.
Discussion
Changes in the vertical distribution of L. scutulata
appear to be related to the tidal cycle. These changes are
modified by the day-night cycle. This is as expected since
movement on their substratum is positively correlated with
dampness (Kops, 1964), a function of both tide and the diel
cycle.
Ascending, high and descending high tides are all
associated with wetness as a result of splash or spray from
the waves. These three periods differ in amount of wetness
and intensity of wave shocks. High tide is by far the most
severe and wettest of these periods, followed by ascending,
then descending tide. Wave shock can present a substantial
danger by dislodging L. scutulata from the rocks (Peterson,
1964). Therefore, it may be important when considering the
behavior of L. scutulata and its distribution. During the
day the rocks are dried more quickly when not exposed to
constant splash.
