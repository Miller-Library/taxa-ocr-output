Vertical Distribution of L. scutulata

in the first two observation periods suggest either movement
into the pool for protection or removal by wave action.
During the first and calmer period of observations there was
no decrease at the peak of the high tide.
The amount of movement Out of Pool during ascending and
descending tides appears to be influenced by two factors.
The first is severity of wave shock and the second is phase
of the diel cycle. The high surf during the second observaÂ¬
tion period is correlated with a suppression of the ascending
tide peaks but not the descending tide peaks at Pool 4 which
is the most exposed. Perhaps both the incoming and high
tides were too rough for movement out of the pool. The
descending tide became the only available wet period which
allowed "safe" movement.
Daytime is correlated with complete suppression of the
peak at descending tide and only partial suppression of the
peak at ascending tide. Coming out of the pool as the tide
recedes during the day could be particularly dangerous because
the sun can quickly dry the substratum and leave the snail
faced with problems of desiccation. There are two other
possible explanations, not associated with wetness, for
a peak in the Out of Pool number during an afternoon ascending
tide. This peak occurs regularly only at the shallowest pool,
Pool 2, and only during the warmer observation period. These
factors, combined with the lack of wash during the day may
have resulted in temperatures exceeding the tolerance range
of L. scutulata. This may have caused movement to the
