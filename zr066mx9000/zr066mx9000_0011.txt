Radioactivity in all tissues studied decreased mark-
edly after 24 hours, which corresponds to the death of the
experimental animals. Premdas and Anderson also observed
this decrease in DDT concentrations while working with
uptake of lethal doses, and attributed it to a possible
alteration in permeability attending death. It appears
that uptake and retention of DDT is an active process.
Death of the experimental fish after 24 hours is probably
not due to acute DDT poisoning. Rather, the general phys-
iological stress on the fish because of DDT uptake may
cause its death by suffocation earlier than control fish;
or more specifically, increased respiration due to DDT
uptake may cause a more rapid depletion of the limited
oxygen supply in the experimental container. No evidence
is available, however, for increased respiration or de-
pletion of the oxygen supply.
Until the time of death, DDT concentrations in all
tissues increases steadily. One notable exception is the
gills, in which the uptake rate decreases almost to zero
after 4 hours (Fig. 2). This suggests a point at which
an equilibrium is achieved between uptake by the gills
and transport of the pesticide by the blood away fromtthe
gills to other parts of the body. An interesting obser-
vation related to this assumption is that brain, liver,
and gut uptake rates decrease slightly and remain fairly
