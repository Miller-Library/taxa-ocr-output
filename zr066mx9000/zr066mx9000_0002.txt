Abstract
Citharichthys stigmaeus of a first year class
population were analyzed by gas chromatography to
determine the concentration of DDT residues in var-
ious tissues. Liver contained 2.6 ppm DDE (wet weight).
Gut and brain tissue contained 0.3 and 0.23 ppm re-
spectively, while gills and muscle had lower concen-
trations of 0.073 and 0.064 ppm DDE.
In uptake experiments, fish were incubated in 1 ppb
C14-labeled DDT for various times up to 36 hours. Ap-
preciable label was found in all tissues after 30 minutes,
increasing to high concentrations in the liver, gut and
brain after 24 hours. Lower, but significant uptake
was found in the skin, gills and muscle.
Fish pulsed for 4 hours in 1 ppb CDDT and sub-
sequently transferred to natural sea water provided data
on DDT excretion. Gills averaged a 90% loss of the initial
pulse label, while skin, liver, gut, brain and muscle
retained 80 - 110% of the DDT after a 72 hour incubation.
