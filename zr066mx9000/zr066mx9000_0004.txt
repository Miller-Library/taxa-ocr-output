Gas chromatographic analyses have been made by
Risebrough (1968, in press) for the English sole from
Monterey Bay in which he found 0.76 ppm total DDT.
Odemar (1968) found DDE levels in the starry flounder
from Monterey Bay of 0.284 ppm. In this investigation,
in addition to an analysis of the ambient levels of DDT
residues found in a sanddab population in southern Mon-
terey Bay, an attempt to determine the approximate rate
of uptake of chlorinated hydrocarbons and their deposi-
tion within the body was made.
Uptake of DDT can be realized in the marine envi-
ronment by two methods: assimilation from ingested food,
or direct absorption from the water environment. Con-
centration of persistent insecticides through food chains
in terrestial, estuarine and marine systems has been in-
vestigated (Woodwell, 1967, Woodwell, et.al., 1967 and
Risebrough, et.al., 1967). Uptake directly from the
water in salmonid fishes has been studied using C-labeled
DDT by Premdas and Anderson (1963) and A.V. Holden (1962)
working with Atlantic salmon and brown trout respectively.
In this investigation, DDT uptake directly from the
water is emphasized. Approximate rates of uptake, depo-
sition in various organs, mobility of the pesticide
within the fish and possible excretion of DDT under con-
ditions of low external concentration of the insecticide
