the lipid content of the tissues in which they are
found (Table 1). The relatively low concentration of
DDE per weight of lipid in the gills suggests that some
of the pesticide is adsorbed on the gill surface. This
conclusion is substantiated by the finding in CDDT up-
take experiments that approximately 50% of the label was
adsorbed of both skin and gills (determined by tissue
washes in dimethylformamide before homogenization).
The evidence that DDT residues are found within the
sanddab in the natural environment shows that the fish
can concentrate the pesticide within its body. The data
from uptake experiments suggest a method for direct up-
take from the water. Evidence here indicates that direct
water uptake of DDT is as important a method for pesti-
cide build-up in the natural environment as accumulation
through the food chain.
Premdas and Anderson (1963) concluded that ClDDT
uptake in the Atlantic salmon occurs mainly through the
gills and is transported through the body by the blood.
My data suggest that the same model is correct for
Citharichthys stigmaeus. Furthermore, because marine fish
swallow water to maintain osmotic balance (Brown, 1957).
an important route of uptake may be through the gut wall.
Data indicate that a limited amount of uptake is through
the skin also, because 50% of the label in skin is absorbed
