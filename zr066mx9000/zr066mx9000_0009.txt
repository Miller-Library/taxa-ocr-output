24 and 36 hours of incubation. Control fish in sealed
jars with normal sea water died between 40 and 45 hours
of incubation. CDDT extracted from the incubation jars
at the end of 24 hours had a concentration of 0.25 ppb.
The 36 hour extract contained 30% of the original 1 ppb.
Data from the 4 hour pulse experiments are listed
in Table 3. All experimental and control fish lived for
the entire 72 hour incubation in normal, aerated sea water.
Sea water extracts had less than 0.01 ppb C1DDT concen-
tration after 72 hours, while the chloroform and NaoH
gas traps contained appreciable labeled DDT (approximately
0.05 ppb in the CHCla and 0.02 ppb in the NaoH after 72
hours). These data suggest that codistillation of any
excreted DDT out of the experimental flasks occurred during
these incubations. The extent of this codistillation
loss can be up to 90% after 48 hours (McCarthy, personal
communication).

Discussion
The concentrations of DDT residues found in a natural
population of Citharichthys stigmaeus support the evidence
(Risebrough, 1968, in press and Odemar, 1968) of the pres-
ence of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides in marine flat-
fish. Separate tissue analyses by gas chromatography
show that ambient pesticide levels are correlated with
