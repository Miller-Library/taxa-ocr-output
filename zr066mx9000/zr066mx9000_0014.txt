in juveniles, because they presumably feed on lower trophic
levels than adults.

The liver has the highest concentrations of DDT res-
idues, both naturally and in uptake experiments. This
organ concentrated DDT most effectively in the Atlantic
salmon (Premdas and Anderson, 1963) and the northern an-
chovy (Kaplan, personal communication). This is andim-
portant consideration because fish liver has been shown
to contain mixed-function oxidases (Buhler, 1968) which
hydroxylate a wide variety of compounds, including steroid
sex hormones, and are induced by DDT and its derivatives,
There are several reasons why the liver should be such an
effective concentration site: 1) DDT absorbed by the gills
can be transported directly to the liver by the hepatic
artery; 2) DDT ingested either with swallowed water or
food reaches the liver by the hepatic portal system directly
from the gut; 3) a large degree of vascularization in the
liver provides greater surface area for absorption of pest-
icide and 4) the liver has a high lipid content.
Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of a typical fish
circulatory system and presents a hypothetical model for
DDT uptake in Citharichthys stigmaeus.
Feeding experiments are necessary to confirm the role
of DDT in food in the total uptake of these fish. It is
assumed that activity from CDDT ingested with food would
be found mainly in the gut, liver and perhaps feces. Most
of the C1DDT remaining in the blood after leaving the
liver would probably be lost through the gills and little
would reach the brain.
