Introduction
The speckled sanddab is a carnivorous, benthic,
marine fish, with a range along the Pacific coast of
North America from Baja California to southeastern Al-
aska. It probably feeds on small benthic invertebrates
such as worms, clams, crabs and shrimps (Baxter, 1960
and Ginsberg, 1952). The sanddab lives in contact
with the bottom and is often buried just below the sand
so that only its eyes are above the substrate. Because
of this close relationship with the bottom it is expected
that this species, and flatfish in general, would be
exposed to much higher levels of DDT residues than pel-
agic fish. The low solubility of DDT residues in water
(Bowman, 1960) may cause thesespesticides to accumulate
within the sediments adsorbed to particulate matter.
A study by the California Department of Fish and Game
(Odemar, 1968) has shown DDT residue levels in marine
bottom sediments to be 9 - 19 ppb, approximately 2800
times greater than concentrations in sea water.
The sanddab was chosen for this investigation be-
cause of its benthic niche and presumably high exposure
to pesticide residues, for its position near the top of
the benthic food web, and for its commercial importance
as a food fish. The species lends itself to experimen-
tation because of its great abundance in the shallow
waters of southern Monterey Bay, small size, ease of
adaptibility to experimental conditions and wide variety
of foods.
