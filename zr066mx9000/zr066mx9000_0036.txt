Map of southern Monterey Bay, California, showing
flatfish collection area.
C1"pDT uptake v. incubation time in C. stigmaeus.
Points for liver (circles) and gut (dots) uptake are
averages for four fish. Highest range of variability
for each tissue is indicated.
C1Â°DDT uptake v. incubation time in C. stigmaeus.
Points for muscle (open triangles), skin (triangles),
gills (circles) and brain (dots) uptake are averages
for four fish. The ordinate scale is the same as in
Fig.2. Highest range of variability for each tissue
is indicated.
C1DDT concentration v. incubation time after a
four hour radioactive pulse. Points for liver (open
squares), gut (squares), gills (triangles), brain
(open triangles), skin (circles), and muscle (dots
are averages for four fish. High ranges of variability
are indicated.
Retention of a four hour pulse label after 72 hour
5.
incubations v. lipid content of tissue in C, stigmaeus.
Schematic diagram of fish circulatory system with
possible sites of DDT entry from water (large arrows)
indicated.
