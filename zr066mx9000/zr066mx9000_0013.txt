cretions. The DDT concentration in the incubation flasks
was quite low, due to constant aeration of the water and
resultant codistillation. Therefore, the situation in
these incubations is favorable for loss of DDT from the
gills. Fig. 5 shows that the gills lost over 90% of their
initial label after 72 hours. Retention of label after
72 hours does not seem to be related to lipid content of
a tissue, but rather to its venous proximity to the gills.
Carnivorous fish have generally lower pesticide levels
in the natural environment than sea birds on the same
trophic level (Risebrough, 1968, in press). An explanation
may be ability to excrete DDT residues via the gills.
The rise in gill radioactivity at 44 hours corres-
ponds with a similar rise in brain concentrations (Fig.
4).
This suggests a mobility of DDT anteriorly, probably via
the hepatic vein, as the liver and gut lose some C14ppT.
Skin and muscle retain their label with few fluctuations
in concentration.
A comparison of gas chromatography (Table 1) and uptake
experiment data shows a direct correlation between ambient
levels and rates of uptake from water (Table 4). This
correlation suggests that uptake directly from water, if
not the most important method of accumulation of chlorinated
hydrocarbons by Citharichthys stigmaeus, is a significant
mode of entry. Food chain effects may not be as evident
