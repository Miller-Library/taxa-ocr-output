constant after the initial four hours until death. The
suggestion is that once equilibrium is achieved in the
gills, the other organs receive absorbed DDT from the
gills at a constant rate. It is possible that uptake
through the gills is in equilibrium with the concentration
of pesticide in the sea water environment and that in
these experiments the adjustment to the higher concen-
tration of DDT takes approximately 4 hours. Further ev-
idence of this proposed dynamic equilibrium is see in the
excretion data.
Fig. 4 shows the results of the pulse experiments.
Organs can be paired according to their position in the
circulatory system: gills - brain, liver - gut, and
skin - muscle. Similarities of the plots for these pairs,
both in pulse and uptake experiments, indicates that
blood circulation is the carrier of DDT residues through-
out the body of the fish. Furthermore, these data sug-
gest that DDT is quite mobile within the body,

The initial drop in concentration in the gills prob-
ablyis due to both loss to the circulatory system and loss
to the environment (Fig. 4). The low lipid content of the
gills increases the exchange efficiency of this organ.
Loss of DDT from the gills seems to be favorable when
equilibrium is disrupted in a less concentrated envir-
onment. The pesticide may be lost due to solubility in
the water, but probably to a sloughing of gill mucus se-
