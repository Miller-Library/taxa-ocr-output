were studied. Direct uptake of DDT from sea water at
concentrations approximating those of the bottom sediments
is shown to be a significant route of pesticide accum-
ulation in Citharichthys stigmaeus.
Materials and Methods
Citharichthys stigmaeus in the 4 - 10 cm. length
range (total length from tip of the closed mouth to end
of caudal fin) were caught in a 10 foot otter trawl off
Del Monte beach in southern Monterey Bay, California (fig. 1).
The fish were collected in water from 1.5 to 10 m. just
outside the surf line. Three collections at the same
location during the month of May, 1969, were sufficient
to provide fish for experimentation. Approximately 40
small flatfish were caught with each 10 minute trawl.
Citharichthys stigmaeus comprised about 75% of the flat-
fish caught by this method. The fish used were approx-
imately 9 months to 1.5 years old, as determined by
scale and otolith measurements (Parrish, personal com-
munication; Arora, 1951), and had not attained sexual
maturity.
In the laboratory, fish were kept in Flowing-water,
aerated aquaria at ambient sea water temperatures of
12 - 15Â°0. They were fed approximately 0.5 g. of frozen
brine shrimp per gram of fish per day.
