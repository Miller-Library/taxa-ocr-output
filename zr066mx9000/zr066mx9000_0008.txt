minute and wet weights of the tissues. C DDT remaining

with petroleum ether and counted with the tissue samples,
For excretion experiments, fish averaging 2.0 g. and
5.4 cm. were incubated in 1 ppb CDDT for 4 hours as in
the uptake experiments. After the 4 hour pulse the fish
were transferred to normal sea water in 3000 ml. incu-
bation flasks for periods of 24, 48, and 72 hours. The
sea water was aerated and gas traps with chloroform and
2M NaoH were set up to prevent CDDT from escaping into
the laboratory. Dissection, homogenization and counting
methods were the same as in the uptake incubations.
Results
Average fish length of the 25 fish pooled for gas
chromatography was 5.3 cm. The results of the analyses
are summarized in Table 1. The ambient levels are given
here in parts per million DDE in both wet weight and
lipid weight. DDT and DDD peaks were also observed in
the samples, but the column was unable to resolve these
peaks into measurable quantities. Risebrough (1968, in
press) found that DDE comprised 70% of the total DDT res-
idues in English sole from Monterey Bay.
Uptake experiment results are given in Table 2. All
fish in incubation jars with 1 ppb C"DDT died between
