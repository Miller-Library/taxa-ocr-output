Analyses for ambient levels of DDT residues were
carried out isothermally (200°0.) on a Beckman Gc4
gas-liquid chromatograph. The machine was equipped
with a 3% QFi column on 80-100 mesh 'Chromosorb W' and
an electron capture detector. Helium was the carrier
gas. Tissue samples were prepared for chromatography
by the perchloric - glacial acetic acid rapid digestion
and cleanup technique described By Stanley and LeFavoure
(1965). Nannograde hexane was used for lipid extraction
and glassware cleaning. Tissues and lipid extracts were
weighed on a Mettler Type H15 Cap. 160g analytical balance.
Glassware was checked on the chromatograph for presence
of DDT residues before each extraction. Tissue samples
were pooled from 25 fish to obtain enough lipid extract
for accurate weight determination. During chromato-
graph operation, standard samples were periodically run
to ensure accuracy of peak height determination,
In the uptake experiments, fish were incubated at
14°0. in sealed one gallon jars containing 1 ppb ring
labeled C"DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)
ethane) with a specific activity of 19 mC/mM. Sea water
in the incubation jars was aerated for approximately 10
minutes prior to addition of radioactive DDT and test
animals, after which the jars were sealed to prevent
loss of DDT by codistillation. Fish were weighed and
measured before incubation. Their average weight was
66
