made of conduction velocity of a bioluminescent wave, maximum
intensity of a wave front, time lit of an area during each wave
front, and period between wave fronts.
Localization of the luminescence on the Pannychia was
confirmed on Megavision as well. A video segment was
accumulated and then overlaid on a bright field image from the
same video session. Annihilation was also observed in slow
motion on the Megavision.
Transection Studies
Various transections were performed on the Pannychia and
the effects were observed and the bioluminescence was recorded
on the SIT camera. These included a single cut of one radial nerve
approximately three centimeters from the caudal end of the
animal (E-1,F-1,F-6,F-3), a double cut of one radial nerve
approximately three and four centimeters from the caudal end (FÂ¬
7), and complete removal of the caudal tip (C-3, C-1). The
transected animals were allowed to sit for one hour before
filming, while the amputated animals were allowed to sit for 24-
36 hours before filming.
Stimulation varied from study to study, but followed the
general pattern of alternating bright field and stimulus attempts.
Usually the first stimulus was ipsilateral and rostral to the cut(s),
the second was near the caudal tip of the animal, and the third
was contralateral and rostral to the cut(s). In the case of
amputation, stimulation was done as with the Natural sea water
experiments.
