enough activity in the nerve net to stimulate the through-
conducting system and spread the bioluminescence over the
whole body regardless of transections.
The role of the through-conducting systems manifests itself
in other ways as well. The general trend of the spreading towards
the caudal end when stimulated in the caudal third is probably a
result of the directional nerves of the deep plexus. The ability of
the bioluminescence to start caudal to the actual point of stimulus
could be the result of the sensory cells transmitting directly to the
through- conducting system before starting bioluminescence in
the nerve net. This would be a highly specialized response, which
agrees with Pantin's idea that through-conducting systems are
specializations, developed differently in different species (Pantin,
1935b).
Another piece of evidence for the nerve net coordination of
bioluminescence is the property of after-discharge, in which
animals continue flashing after the stimulus has ceased. This is
common in Pannychia, as bioluminescent waves will often move
on the body and enter new areas long after the initial gentle tap
has ended. Pantin described this as an unpredictable property
that gave an arbitrary element to nerve net responses (Pantin,
1935c). On his research in Renilla, Nicol observed a similar effect
and concluded that this is obviously a condition dependent on
excitation of the nerve net (Nicol, 1955).
A generally slow conduction velocity is another
characteristic of nerve nets. This is largely because the level of
facilitation needed and the conduction velocity are inversely
