related (Pantin, 1935b). The conduction velocities in Pannychia fit
this description. The range from 5.2-47.6 cm/s is similar to the
observed ranges for other nerve net systems. For example,
Pantin found three ranges depending on direction of 5-10 cm/s,
9-20 cm/s, and 4-120 cm/s in Calliactis and Nicol found a range of
6.66-10.15 cm/s in Renilla (Pantin, 1935b, Nicol 1955). This
points to a nerve net in which conduction velocity is low in
response to a high interneural facilitation. The speeds in
Pannychia are much slower than the 55cm/s observed in the
radial nerve cord of the brittlestar Ophiapturis papillae (Yee,
Burkhardt, Gilly, 1987). Also, the range of conduction velocities is
not unheard of, as Brehm reported a range of 10-85 cm/s within a
single animal for bioluminescence along an ophiuroid radial nerve
(Brehm, 1977). One explanation for the varying speeds could be
varying levels of interneural facilitation and through-conduction
interacting to form bioluminescence.
Another characteristic common to nerve nets is unpolarized
synapses. This was observed in video footage as a reversal of
wave direction within a single bioluminescent set. This is
indicative of a bi-directional synapse system which allows for
multiple diffuse conduction pathways (Bullock, 1965).
Overall, the bioluminescence seems to follow complex
predetermined general patterns which could be inherent to the
nerve net (Bullock, 1965). The bioluminescence of the nerve net
seems to spread throughout the basiepithelial plexus, except at
the base of papillae (figure 7). Here the wave disappears and
then reappears on the other side. It seems as if the nerve net
