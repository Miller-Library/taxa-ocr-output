Single transection of a radial nerve. Green indicates
normal bioluminescence, red indicates disturbed
bioluminescence, x' indicates spot of
stimulation, and the bar indicates the
transection.
a. Ipsilateral stimulation.
b. Contralateral stimulation.
c. Transport stimulation.
10. Ipsilateral stimulation with double transection of a
radial nerve, single frame.
11. Contralateral stimulation with double transection of a
radial nerve, single frame. The cut is evident at
the bottom of the animal in the figure.
12. Double transection of a radial nerve. The legend is the
same as for figure 9.
