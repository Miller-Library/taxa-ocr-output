Abstract
Pannychia moseleyi is a deep-sea holothurian found at
depths from approximately 500m to 3000m in the Monterey Bay
Canyon. The bioluminescence in Pannychia moseleyi has a
complex dynamic pattern spread throughout the epithelium, but
absent from the tube feet, papillae, and tentacles. The waves
observed were greatly varied, but can fit into three general
classifications - spiral, circular from a point, and traveling. The
basis of bioluminescence in Pannychia appears to be intracellular
and microscopic, and shows strong evidence for being passed in an
excitable medium such as a nerve net. The strongest evidence for
the coordination by a nerve net comes from transection studies.
Introduction
Pannychia moseleyi (Figure 1) is a deep-sea holothurian
found at depths from approximately 500m to 3000m in the
Monterey Bay Canyon. One of the most interesting characteristics
of Pannychia is the dynamic bioluminescence elicited by tactile
stimulation. Propagation occurs over most of the dorsal surface,
and tends to concentrate near the caudal end. The
bioluminescence travels in complex patterns consisting of spiral,
circular, and traveling waves.
The main purpose of this study was to investigate these
patterns in relation to the morphological characteristics of the
