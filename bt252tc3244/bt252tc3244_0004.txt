stopping after one stimulus attempt if bioluminescence failed to
occur. The whole filming process for three animals usually took
10-15 minutes.
After the filming session, the Pannychia were transferred
back to their larger containers and bioluminescence observed was
recorded.
Magnesium Chloride Filming
Animals were transferred in a method similar to above into
Rubbermaid Butterdishes containing different ratios of 5 C
Isotonic MgCl2 (110 mM MgCl2 added to Natural Sea Water for
160 mM MgCl2 total) and natural sea water and allowed to sit for
45 minutes before filming. The ratios ranged from 1 part
isotonic/2 part natural sea water to 1 part isotonic/7 parts natural
sea water. Filming was performed with the same protocol as in
natural sea water; three bright field images with two
bioluminescent attempts interspersed. Ã„fter filming the animals
were transferred by hand back into their normal Rubbermaid
containers. The level of bioluminescent activity was noted on
both transfers into and out of the experimental solution.
Computer Analysis
Video footage was analyzed using the Megavision in Dr.
Stuart Thompson's laboratory at Hopkins Marine Station. The
footage was first transferred to Optical Memory Disc Recording
(OMDR) to allow for easier manipulation and a sharp image for
processing. Using a combination of functions, measurements were
