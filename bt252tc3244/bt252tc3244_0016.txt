continues through the base of the papillae, but that photocytes are
lacking in these areas. This explains the dark unexcitable spots.
The origin of the dark unexcitable bands seems to stem from an
apparent connection of the dark unexcitable spots. This is
probably due to the complex wiring of the nerve net in relation to
the distribution of papillae. All of these factors help to contribute
to each animal having a distinctive pattern, sometimes enough to
be identified based solely on a bioluminescent wave.
There are many theories as to the actual function of
bioluminescence in oceanic and coastal marine organisms. These
range from the burglar alarm effect in which the prey tries to
attract the predators of its predators to the lure effect in which
the bioluminescence is meant to attract prey (Young, 1983; Morin,
1983) Since the bioluminescence is initiated purely by
stimulation in Pannychia, this limits the functions to defense
mechanisms. Because of the paucity of information about the
predators of Pannychia, it is hard to guess as to which defense
theory is most appropriate. Based purely on observations of the
waves and localization of bioluminescence in Pannychia, it seems
that the whole body flash could be a warning to other Pannychia
of danger in the area or an attempt to startle the predator and
gain freedom. The tendency to bioluminesce near the tail and the
amputation experiments point to the idea that this limited
bioluminescence might attract the predator to the dispensable
part of the body, and thus preserve life as a whole.
