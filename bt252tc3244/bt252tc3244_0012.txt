The effects that Magnesium Chloride has on the
bioluminescence point towards a neural system which involves
muscarinic channels. At high enough concentration (1 part
isotonic MgCl2 / 2 parts natural sea water) the Mg++ ions are
prevalent enough to anesthetize the animal and halt
bioluminescence. At lower concentrations, it is likely that the
threshold increase is due to competition between Mgtt and Catt
ions at muscarinic channels. This leads to the shorter
bioluminescence and the need for multiple stimulations to elicit
the bioluminescence. Similarly, it has been observed in
Coelenterate nerve nets that Mg+ ions depress the response
without preventing conduction (Bullock, 1965).
There is considerable evidence for the coordination of
bioluminescence by a nerve net localized in the basiepithelial
plexus. The nervous systems of the Holothuria contain features of
both primitive and advanced design. Similar to coelenterates,
they have a fiber system with a net arrangement located in the
epithelial layer and composed of small-celled interneurons. In
addition they have a central nervous system composed of the five
radial nerve cords and the nerve ring. (Smith, 1965). These two
systems, interacting via polarized specializations for throughÂ¬
conduction in the deep plexus, allow for a complex system of
control of bioluminescence.
The strongest evidence for the coordination by a nerve net
comes from the transection studies. With a single cut of the radial
nerve bioluminescence can diffuse around the cut and propagate
towards the caudal end, however the through -conducting system
