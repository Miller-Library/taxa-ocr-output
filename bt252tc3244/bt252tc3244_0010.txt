even upon major stimulus. At lower ratios of isotonic MgCl2, the
animals had a raised threshold for bioluminescence. This led to
multiple taps being needed to elicit bioluminescence and short
total lengths of bioluminescent propagation.
Mathematical Data
From analysis on the Megavision, some mathematical
characteristics of the waves have been found. The conduction
velocity varies within each specimen and across the population.
has a range of 5.2-47.6 cm/sec with an average conduction
velocity of 17.6 cm/sec. (Figure 13). The velocity in transection
studies has a range of 14.2-18.1 cm/sec and an average of 15.54
cm/sec. Thus it appears that near a transection, both the faster
and slower pathways are obliterated. The period between
successive wave fronts ranges from .33 s to .69 s and has an
average of 5 s and a standard deviation of .1 s. Also, the velocity
and period are inversely related. (Figure 14).
Discussion
Unlike the bioluminescence of other holothurians studied by
Robison (1992) and Herring (1974), the bioluminescence in
Pannychia moseleyi has a complex dynamic pattern spread
throughout the epithelium, but absent from the tube feet, papillae,
and tentacles. This dynamic bioluminescence appears to be
located in the basiepithelial plexus where it is under a nerve net
control. Through-conduction is via the polarized deep plexus and
