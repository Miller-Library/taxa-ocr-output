is interrupted and the signal travels less than expected in a
normal animal and becomes a more localized response. With a
double cut of a radial nerve, bioluminescence is halted and fails to
propagate past the disrupted area. In both cases, the bigger
stimulus of lifting the animal causes bioluminescence to spread
over the whole surface, with slight disturbances near the cuts.
The lack of annihilation and the change of direction when the
wave front reaches the edge of the cut gives evidence for multiple
possible conduction pathways. These results show how there is a
diffuse conduction of nervous excitation that has a tolerance for
incomplete cuts. This is a definition of a nerve net (Bullock,
1965).
The transection studies point towards interneural facilitation
which is a common aspect of nerve net conduction (Smith, 1965;
Pantin, 1935a). The single cut allows transmission to pass because
the signal can find a more diffuse path through the nerve net and
circumvent the obliterated area. The double cut causes more
problems and halts transmission because the need for facilitation
prevents the more circuitous routes from succeeding.
The transection studies also shed light on the through-
conducting system located in the polarized deep plexus. Since the
through-conducting system receives its stimulation from the
basiepithelial plexus, a disturbance of the nerve net will lead to a
subsequent disturbance of the deep plexus. This is seen in the
single cut in which the bioluminescence can spread past the cut,
but it remains as a localized luminescence due to the degradation
of the signal in the deep plexus. The larger stimulus presents
