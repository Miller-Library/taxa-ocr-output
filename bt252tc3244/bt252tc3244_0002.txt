Holothuria. From these studies it appears that the
bioluminescence is coordinated by a nerve net located in the
basiepithelial plexus and that through-conduction is mediated by
a combination of the deep plexus and the radial nerve cords.
Materials & Methods
Collection
Animals were collected using the remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) Ventana on multiple cruises of the MBARI research vessel
Point Lobos in the Monterey Bay. Three specimens were collected
prior to the spring course. Seven more specimens were collected
in on April 6, 1993. Two more specimens were collected in depths
of on April 19,1993. One specimen was collected at a depth of
April 26,1993. The last seven specimens used for research were
collected on May 4, 1993. Three more Pannychia were collected
on May 24, 1993, but were only observed. They were collected in
depths ranging from 550 to 900 meters.
Storage
All Pannychia were placed in Rubbermaid containers with 5
C sea water and a little sediment on board the Point Lobos. Upon
arrival at Hopkins Marine Station, the Pannychia were placed in
the water holding tanks in the Deep Sea Lab. These were kept at
temperatures from 5-7 C. While in the holding tanks, the
Pannychia were maintained in complete darkness except when
the insulated covers were lifted. The animals were divided into
groups based mostly on the date of collection. The original three
