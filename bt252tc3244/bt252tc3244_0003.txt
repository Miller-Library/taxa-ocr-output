became group A. The next seven became B 1-4 and C 1-3. The
remaining Pannychia became D-1 and D-2, E-1, F 1-7, and G 1-3.
The numbers within the group were arbitrary and were assigned
based on the order of use for experimentation.
Natural Sea Water Filming
The animals to be filmed were transferred by hand from
their holding Rubbermaid containers into a Rubbermaid
butterdish filled with 5 C sea water. Bioluminescent activity
during transfer was noted. The animals were then covered,
placed back in the holding tanks, and allowed to recover for 45 to
90 minutes (usually 60 minutes). The whole transfer process was
done under red light.
The filming was done using a Cohu Silicon-Intensified Tube
(SIT) camera. The camera was set on Auto while a bright field
image was taken. The light was switched off and the camera set
on Manual with maximum gain and black contrast at one quarter
for the filming of bioluminescence. All filming was done on the
dorsal surface of the animal (the bivium). (Figure 2) The stimulus
was a gentle tap with a quarter centimeter diameter glass rod
usually near the caudal end of the animal slightly lateral to one of
the bivium radial nerves. The darkness was maintained until the
bioluminescence ceased. Another bright field image was then
taken. This process was then repeated so that for each recording
session an animal had three bright field images and two stimulus
attempts. This procedure would sometimes be altered by adding
a third stimulus attempt to ensure good video footage or by
