connects to the central nervous system of the radial nerve cord
for more distant transfers. (Smith, 1965)
Similar to Enypniastes eximia (Robison, 1992), the basis of
bioluminescence in Pannychia appears to be intracellular and
microscopic. The individual photocytes could not be resolved with
video imaging, which gives them a maximum size of 100 microns
(Robison measured 35 microns for Enypniastes eximia). Evidence
for the intracellular nature comes from the short time lit of .05-.4
seconds, which is similar to the 1 second found for Ptychordia
flava by Baxter and Pickens (1964) and much too short for the
discharge of luminous secretions which last minutes (Baxter and
Pickens, 1964). Also, the photocytes show no fatigue in maximum
intensity as a set of waves propagate through, which would not be
expected in an extracellular system (Baxter, 1964).
The bioluminescence of Pannychia shows strong evidence
for it being passed in an excitable medium such as a nerve net.
The strongest evidence comes from annihilation as shown in
figures 6a, 6b and 6c. Annihilation is a characteristic property of
excitable media, and is prevalent in the complex waves of
Pannychia.. The presence of spiral waves also points to an
excitable medium, as the spiral results from the refractory period
which defines this type of medium. The inverse correlation
between velocity and period is not typical of the excitable media
models presented in the literature (Gerhardt, 1990). This does not
show that it is not an excitable medium, as the physiological
system of a nerve net does not perfectly align with a chemical
reaction or other models.
