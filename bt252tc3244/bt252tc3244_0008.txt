in size, and thus appear to be amalgamations of individual
photocytes.
It can be seen that the photocytes do not fatigue during
multiple wave stimulations as they can reach the same intensity
throughout. For example, in bioluminescence seen in C-2, the
maximum intensity scale of 255 (out of 255) was reached on
seven successive wave fronts passing through the same point.
This is seen in the other specimens that had multiple wave fronts
passing through a single point as well.
Transection Studies
Transection studies were performed to investigate the
pathways involved in bioluminescence. Upon transection of a
single radial nerve, the bioluminescent response is altered
markedly. While the bioluminescence can travel past the point of
the cut in both ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation, the
bioluminescence does not travel as far towards the caudal end in
ipsilateral stimulation as would be expected from observations of
normal animals. When transferred, the bioluminescence is normal
except immediately around the cut, where a disturbance in the
wave pattern results in a diffuse glow. (Figure 9) Upon double
transection of a single radial nerve, the bioluminescent response is
altered even more. Ipsilateral stimulation bioluminescence stops
at the double transection in a sharp line and tip stimulation
bioluminescence stops at a similar sharp line on the other side of
the double transection. (Figures 10 and 11) In both cases, the
wave front reaches the cut, and instead of annihilating or
