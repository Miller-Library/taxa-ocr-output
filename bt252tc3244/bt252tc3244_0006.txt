General Trends
Some general patterns of bioluminescence could be
observed. Ninety per cent of the time the bioluminescence would
appear caudal to the stimulus (up to 1-2 cm) and propagate in the
caudal third of the animal, usually lasting longest at the caudal tip.
Ten per cent of the time, however, the bioluminescence would
travel in both directions from the point of stimulus, thus lighting
up a greater portion of the animal. In these cases, the central
section of the animal would usually cease bioluminescence 3-8
seconds before the caudal section. With repeated stimulation, the
Pannychia would eventually fatigue to the stimulus, and would
fail to produce luminescence. In such cases, luminescence could
be elicited by lifting the animal during transfer back to its main
container. This bioluminescence tended to cover the whole
surface with bioluminescence again lasting longest near the caudal
end.
Wave Types and Characteristics
The waves observed were greatly varied, but can fit into
three general classifications - spiral, circular from a point, and
traveling. (Figures 3, 4, and 5) The traveling waves tended to
show up with the gentle stimulus of the glass rod. They would
travel along the radial cord and sometimes cross to another radial
cord. An isolated traveling wave was not common, but was
probably often present in more complex patterns. Spiral and
