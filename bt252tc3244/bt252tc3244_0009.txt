dissipating, changes direction and runs along the cut, as if looking
for a new path. Contralateral stimulation bioluminescence travels
down the contralateral side and lights the whole caudal area.
When transferred, the bioluminescence is normal except for
diffuse glows around the immediate cut area, even without
stimulation in the area between the two cuts. (Figure 12) In both
sets of transections, the specimens can be seen to reseal the cut
and start the regeneration of the damaged area.
Amputations
Removal of the caudal tip served two purposes, to
investigate the recovery of the animal and to see if
bioluminescence could be produced in isolated sections of the
animal. Upon removal of the caudal tip (Icm), the specimens
healed their caudal ends and within 24-36 hours gave
bioluminescent responses that were similar to earlier responses,
except that they were longer. The animals were healthy and
recovered well from their amputations. The isolated pieces could
not be made to bioluminesce - even with treatment with KCl,
Nacl, and prodding with forceps.
Magnesium Chloride
Different ratios of MgCl2 were employed to investigate the
neural properties of the bioluminescence in relation to calcium
channels. The 1 part isotonic MgCl2/ 2 part natural sea water
solution had the ability to knock out bioluminescence completely,
