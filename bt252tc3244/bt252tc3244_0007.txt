circular waves tended to show up in both point stimulus and
animal transfer stimulus. They were often both present on the
same animal and resulted in complex patterns running in
repetitive cycles on the surface of the specimen. Within these
complex patterns annihilation was often observed. Annihilation is
defined as when two intense waves propagate towards each other,
and upon collision result in a loss of luminescent activity. (Figures
6a, 6b, and 6c) Waves of luminescence are also bi-directional. and
there are specific instances of a wave reversing direction in the
course of one stimulation.
Localization of Bioluminescence
The bioluminescence tends to be localized on the bivium and
does not occur on the tube feet, the papillae, or the tentacles
surrounding the oral opening. Bioluminescence does not appear to
occur on the trivium between the two rows of tube feet. Within
the bivium, there are dark unexcitable spots which correspond to
the base of the papillae. (Figure 7) In less intense bioluminescent
waves, these spots can appear connected giving the overall
appearance of parallel dark unexcitable bands. (Figure 8) The
actual photocytes of bioluminescence are below the resolution of
the Megavision, which puts them in the range of less than 100
microns (based on one pixel at 9 pixels/mm). On examination of
one animal in particular(F-7), it appears that units of
bioluminescence are arranged in a regular fashion, separated by
approximately 500-800 microns. These units have a large range
