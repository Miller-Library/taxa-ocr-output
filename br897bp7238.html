avoidance of sunlight has been previously noted (Ricketts
and Calvin, 1968). This species was rare intertidally,
being more common subtidally.
STENOPLAX HEATHIANA
Stenoplax heathiana generally was found on the sides of
large, rather bare rocks resting on a sandy bottom; this is
in accord with observatinns by Johnson and Snook (1935)
and Ricketts and Calvin (1968<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mopalia : Exact'>). Ther</span>e seemed to be no size¬

on a barren substrate is they eat large bits of drift algae
that lodge at the base of the rocks (MacGinitie and MacGinitie,
1968).

was found in crevices, in the open. Only one animal was
found at Stillwater Cove.

JUVENILE CHITONS
The habitat of the majority of juvenile chitons was:
a) low in the intertidal ranging between the O and +3 foot
tidal levels; b) damp; c) shady or dark; d) protected from
wave shock by surrounding boulders, overhanging ledges, or
by being within crevices. This zone corresponded to that of
tunicates and sponges. Yet a young chiton was never found on
either, but rather on bare rock or rock encrusted with such
algae as Corallina gracilis forma densa Collins, and members
of the genera Lithothamnion, Lithophyllum, and Hildenbrandia.
SUMMARY
1. The habitats of 12 intertidal chitons from six sites on
the Monterey Peninsula in central California picked for
variability in surf exposure and substrate type, were
described in terms of physical factors and biological
associates. The chitons were Cryptochiton stelleri,
Cyanoplax hartwegii, Ischnochiton regularis, Katharina
tunicata, Mopalia ciliata, Mopalia hindsii, Mopalia lignosa
Mopalia muscosa, Nuttallina californica, Placiphorella velata,
Stenoplax heathiana, and Tonicella lineata.
2. The most important environmental parameters in determing
chiton habitats proved to be surf strength, light exposure,
substrate compositin, moisture and biological associates.

INTRODUCTION
Chitons make up a conspicuous postion of the intertidal
fauna of the California coastline. Various species are
known to be characteristic of particular intertidal zones
(Ricketts and Calvin, etc.), yet little is known about their
specific habitats. Only two researchers have given this topic
more than cursory treatment in print; Barnawell, (1954)
for Mopalia spp. and Barnes (1972) for Tonicella lineata
(Wood, 1815).
We selected six areas of the Monterey Peninsula shore¬
line, differing in exposure and substrate, and examined the
speific habitats of the following chiton species: Cryptochiton
stelleri (Middendorff, 1846); Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter,
1855); Ischnochiton regularis (Carpenter, 1855); Katharine
tunicata (Wood, 1815); Mopalia ciliata (Sowerby, 1840);
Mopalia hindsii (Reeve, 1847); Mopalia lignosa (Gould, 1846);
Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846); Nuttallina californica (Reeve,
1847); Placiphorella velata Carpenter in Dall, 1878; <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cryptochiton : Exact'>Stenoplax
he</span>athiana (Berry, 1946); and Tonicella lineata. These habitats
are herein described. Also included is a description of the
habitat where juvenile chitons were most commonly found.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From April 22 to May 9, 1974, each study site was surveyed
during the lower lowtides. Descriptions of plant and animal

Andrus and Legard Intertidal Chiton Habitats
associates of each species of chiton were recorded, along with
detailed chiton density maps (maps on file at Hopkins Marine
Sta<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Cyanoplax : Exact'>tion, Pac</span>ific Grove, California). Species were collected
and identified using Burghar<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pelvetia fastigiata : Exact'>dt and Burghardt, 1</span>969, the key
to chitons in Light, et.al., (1964); and a preliminary copy
of the chiton key appearing in Smith an<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Fucus distichus : Exact'>d Carlton (1975</span>).
From May 10 to May 28, all six study sites were examined for
habitat parameters characteristic of the m<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>ost abundant chiton
sp</span>ecies. Relative surf and sun exposure, substrate conditions
and vertical distribution (as determined by algae distribution
- Doty, 1946) were noted. Sites were examined at high tide
as well as low water, to dete<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Hildenbrandia occidentalis : Exact'>rmine the surf strength.
S</span>TUDY SITES
Figure 1 shows the locations of the sites on the Monterey
Peninsula.
Yankee Point consists of large granite platforms split

pools, with sparse flora and abundant fauna, are exposed to
strong surf action.
Carmel Point consists of a broad belt of large granite
boulders bordered by a sandy beach, it experiences moderate
surf action. The boulders provide for f<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Ischnochiton : Exact'>ew tidepools</span>,<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Regularis : Exact'> and only</span>

DESCRIPTION OF HABITATS CHARACTERISTIC OE SPECIES STUDIED
CRYPTOCHITON STELLERI
Cryptochiton stelleri was found next to and in very deer
tidepools and channels. They were not predominantly on huge
rocks on sandy beaches, contrary to the findings of MacGinitie
and MacGinitie (1968). We encountered individuals at the t1.O

ft. tidal level, totally exposed to full sunlight. This
conflicts with reports that individulas are sensitive to light
and only remain out of water when it is foggy (Ricke<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Mytilus californianus : Exact'>tts
and Calvin, 1968)</span>.
CYANOPLAX HAR<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tetraclita squamosa rubescens : Exact'>TWEGII
Cyanoplax hartwegii wa</span>s found in two distinct habitats:
1) under Pelvetia fastigiata (J<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Endocladia muricata : Exact'>. G. Agardh) DeToni</span>; and 2)
in small, wet crevices or depressions. Occasionally individuals
were found under Fucus distichus Linnaeus. Apparently,
constant moisture and protection from direct surf are major
characteristics of the C. hartwegii habitats. Less than 2%
of those studied were exposed to direct surf, perhaps becasue
they cannot maintain attachment when exposed to wave shock.
Macroalga cover was not always present, though crustose
coralline algae or Hildenbrandia occidentalis Setchell were
consistent companions at all locations except the wet shale
at Stillwater Cove. C. hartwegii's common occurance under
fronds of Pelvetia is described by Ricketts and Calvin (1968),
and we confirm this association. We found no avoidance of
direct sunlight, as long as sufficient moisture w<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Muscosa : Exact'>as pres</span>ent
(e.g., wet shale at Stillwater Cove), an observation in conflict
with one recorded by Ricketts and Calvin (1968).
ISCHNOCHITON REGULARIS
Ischnochiton regularis was found only on the bottom of
page 6
Andrus and Legard
Intertidal Chiton Habitats
smooth rocks, 15 cm to 30 cm in diameter, resting on a rocky
bottom. The only other organisms found on these rocks were
unidentified microscopic green and blue-green algae. Individuals
were usually found in groups of two or three per rock. All
seemed to avoid direct sunlight. No mention of I. regularis
habitat was found in the literature.
KATHARINA TUNICATA
Katharina tunicata was abundant in two distinct habitats:
1) in low numbers at the Iridaea flaccida (Setchell and Gardner)
Hollenberg and Abbott level of almost vertical granite surfaces,
a habitat found at almost all the study sites; and 2) in higher
numbers in shallow, exposed tidepools with crustose coralline
algae covering the bottom; t<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Peyssonnelia meridionalis : Exact'>his habitat occurred only</span> at
Yankee and Cypress Points. In addition, small in<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Nuttallina : Exact'>dividuals
</span>(less than 6 cm long) were found in depressions inhabited by
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857) and
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt, 1835). At Yankee Point
we observed a size gradient with larger animals further from
the surf. The largest were fou<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Pollicipes polymerus : Exact'>nd in the protected c</span>hannels on
the leeward walls. Our results agree with previous work
(MacGinitie and MacGinitie, 1968) in that individuals were
found along open, rocky coasts, not necessarily in direct
surf, but not in a<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Postelsia : Exact'> habitat </span>as well protected as Stillwater
Cove.

MOPALIA CILIATA
Mopalia ciliata was the chiton least encountered, perhaps
because it was inconspicuous. Tucked in crevices among
Mytilus californianus Conrad, 1837, Tetraclita squamosa
rubescens Darwin, 1854, crustose coralline algae, Pelvetia
fastigiata and Endocladia muricata (Postels and Ruprecht)
J. G. Agardh, members of this species often had its girdle
buried in sand. Found mainly below the +2.5 ft tidal level
and noted subtidally at Mussel Point, this animal was exposed
to little or no surf.
MOPAL<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>IA HINDSII
We </span>found Mopalia hindsii to be more exposed to air during
low tides than the other Mopalia species. Individuals were
usually in crevices nestled among associated algae, and often
covered with a thick algal growth on the valves.
MOPALIA LIGNOSA
Mopalia lignosa has the most specific habitat of the
chitons in this study. Individuals inhabited the undersides
of movable rocks resting on rocky bottom. Some animals were
found on the sides of rocks or in deep, smooth crevices and
occasionally at the bottom of high tidepools.
MOPAL<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Placiphorella : Exact'>IA MUSCOSA
Mo</span>p<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Velata : Exact'>alia m</span>uscosa was found predominantly in two habitats:

1) in wet, protected, large crevices from the +1.5 ft to t3.0
ft. tidal levels; and 2) in high, protected tidepools up to
+5.0 ft tidal level. In addition, after individuals were found
under algae (Fucus distichus and Pelvetia fastigiata), and
under rocks. At Stillwater Cove, a high density also was
found on slight irregularities a<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Stenoplax : Exact'>long flat</span>, horizontal, very
wet shale. None were exposed to direct surf. More than 97%
of the individuals examined were in direct contact with moisture;

lying partially buried in moist sand, or sitting under wet
macroalgae. More than 90% of the individuals examined had
their anterior ends lower than their posterior ends and in
contact with moisture. Almost all individuals (with<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tonicella : Exact'> the
exce</span>p<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Lineata : Exact'>tion of</span> those at Stillwater Cove) were found near either
Peyssonnelia meridionalis Hollenberg and Abbott or crustose
coralline algae.
NUTTALLINA CALIFORNIA
Nuttallina californica <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>was found </span>in three distinct
situations. Listed in order of highest to lowest density.
these were: 1) the bottom of bare rock depressions the size
of their bodies; 2) squeezed between the bases of Tetraclita
squamosa rubescens, Pollicipes polymerus, (Sowerby, 1833), and
Mytilus californianus; and 3) wedged in small crevices in high,
shallow tidepools. Rare individuals were found in large, shallow
depressions at the base of Pelvetia fastigiata and Postelsia

palmaeformis Ruprecht. Surf strength at depression localities
varied widely from very strong at Yankee Point to moderately
weak at Stillwater Cove. Nuttallina californica was found
in areas both with and without macroalgae, though highest
densities were in the macroalgae-free depressions. Apparently.
a major habitat factor is the need for protection from the
direct shearing force of the surf. Only about 5% were not
firmly entrenched in a crevice, depression, or space where the
surf's force was depleted. MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1968)

in these depressions. We found individuals on rocks exposed
to a wide range of surf strengths, but few such rocks were in
areas of weak surf. More than 98% of the animals were in
the presence of erect or crustoee coralline algae. None
were found on flat areas, unless sessile animals or high¬
profile algae were present. The largest individuals were found
in the high, shallow tidepools, but here the density was very
low.
PLACIPHORELLA VELATA
Placiphorella velata were found on the flat sides of
movable rocks and on the walls of deep tidepools, always below
the -1.0 ft tidal level. The individuals were always found in
shade and always with red crustose coralline algae. Their
