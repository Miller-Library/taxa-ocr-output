females. Male responses to water temperatures are variable between species. Unlike
females, males probably have other stimuli to which they respond. Perhaps these stimuli
could come from the presence of active females, food availability, yearly sexual cycles or a
genetically inherited trait that has been developed along with behavioral characteristics.
The mechanism is purely speculative at this point. Female bluefin must either have
consistently warm water to begin development, or the time of vitellogenesis is pre-
programmed. Males require either similar conditions or the presence of active female.
Any of these hypotheses make it unlikely for bluefin to spontaneously spawn wherever or
whenever the appropriate conditions are met. Just because the environment is temporarily
correct for spawning in a gulf stream eddy, it does not mean bluefin will spawn there.
Conducive spawning conditions must either be consistent, familiar, or both. Knowing the
amount of time it takes for each sex to go from the mature, inactive state to an active one
would be a great help to determine where spawning is possible. Assuming no heritable
influence in yearly cycles, how long after arriving in the Gulf, or a region conducive to
spawning, will fish start to become sexually active and eventually spawn?
If the behavior recorded by the PSAT in the Gulf of Mexico does represent
spawning behavior, then this bluefin took at least two months to start spawning. This data
also suggests that, as previously hypothesized, the peak spawning season is in May when
SSTâ€™s are most conducive for larval devlopment. More tags back from this region may
reveal the degree of variability within the species.
In conclusion, the gonad histology of scombrids is very similar and the stages of
sexual maturity of one species can be used to identify the stages of another. Yellowfin
