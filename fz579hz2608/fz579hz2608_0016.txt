spent within the top 10 m below sea level and within a narrow temperature range between
25째C and 27.5째C (Fig. 11).
Discussion
Although the basic reproductive biology of tuna remains relatively consistent
among the different species, important differences in behavior and life history lead to
unique characteristics of each. While the similarities allow us to learn about the unknown
stages of less known species, the differences keep the investigation interesting and crucial
for properly managing respective fisheries.
Female tuna, even if mature, will not become sexually active unless the
environment meets specific requirements. These have been speculated to include food
availability, salinity and most importantly temperature. Females of most species of tuna
will only become sexually active (start developing the ovaries) if the SST is consistently
25째C or warmer (Sund, 1981; Schaefer 1998). Bonito, an ectothermic sister taxa to tunas,
become sexually active and spawn in temperatures as cold as 20째C. While warmer water
temperatures do correlate to an increase in percentage of sexually active fish for S.
chiliensis (Goldberg and Mussiett), the lower range of temperature at which bonito can
become sexually active makes sense considering their geographic distribution in the higher
latitudes. It is unknown if an upper temperature limit exists for spawning in S. chiliensis,
but if so, it might explain the gap in their distribution across the tropics.
The natural range of the yellowfin tuna includes the tropical Pacific where SST is
consistently high. In this region, some spawning occurs year-round with peak activity in
direct correlation with SST (Schaefer, 1998). As shown in this study, female yellowfin do
