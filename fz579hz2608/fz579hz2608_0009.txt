the fish (Fig. 2, 3). Generally the wild samples did not have gonad mass data so GST's
could not be calculated.
Histological Classification
Sexual maturity and spawning status was determined histologically according to
the methods outlined by Schaefer (1998). This system of classification was derived from
earlier methods developed on related fish such as northern anchovy Engraulis mordax,
and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis and have been used on southern bluefin (Farley
1998) and a variety of species within the scombrid family. All tissues were examined
under an Olympus BH-2 light microscope with an Olympus DPIO digital camera
attachment.
Females
Ovaries are considered asynchronous, meaning multiple stages of oocytes can be
present in the ovary at once and that fish are capable of multiple spawnings per season.
(Schaefer 1998). Females were staged based on the most advanced oocytes present in the
ovary. Oocytes were classified into five stages: (1) unyolked, (2) early yolked, (3)
advanced yolk, (4) migratory nucleus, (5) hydrated (Fig. 4A,B,C; 6A). Postovulatory
follicles were classified into three stages depending on time since ovulation: O h, 512 h
old, and 212 h old. Postovulatory follicles are only identifiable up to 24 h after ovulation
before they are completely resorbed. Yolked oocytes that had not been ovulated and
were being resorbed were classified as atretic. Two stages of atresia, a and B were
distinguished (Fig. 4E, F) to describe early (G) atresia where the yolk is being resorbed,
and late (B) atresia when the thecal and granulosa cell layers are rearranged and resorbed
