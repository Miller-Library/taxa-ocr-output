sexual maturity from wild caught yellowfin tuna. Female yellowfin at 25°C showed
slightly more advanced oocytes than females at 20°C. Both sexes of bonito become
sexually active in captivity and spawn in 20°C water. Together, histological observations
of the captive populations reveal all the stages of gonadal development needed to classify
scombrid gonad samples. Based on comparative histological analyses, I concluded that all
bluefin gonadal tissues (n-111) from New England and North Carolina were sexually
inactive and therefore not spawning. All fish from the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas
(n=5) demonstrated asynchronous ovaries with many oocytes yolked and in maturation
stages just prior to spawning. The lack of fully hydrated oocytes, indicative of a currently
spawning fish is probably due to the small sample size and time of capture. The two
Bahama fish represent the first histological observations of sexually active bluefin tuna
outside the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding the reproductive biology and the size at first
spawning is a crucial step for developing future management strategies.
