40) and a low level of atresia. Another fish (239 cm) had ovaries containing more
advanced yolked oocytes (Fig. 4D) but still very low levels of atresia. The last fish (218
cm) had all stages of vitellogenesis present in abundance as well as a high degree of o and
ÃŸ atretic oocytes (Fig. 4). This was considered the most developed ovary. It is interesting
to note that the fat pad associated with the gonad was reported resorbed and the gonadal
tissue was highly vascularized. No males were sampled from the Gulf of Mexico.
In the Florida Straits, one female bluefin was caught and measured to be 673 lbs
(est. = 263 cm). Its ovaries contained an abundance of advanced yolked oocytes, & level
atresia and very few unyolked oocytes. One 916 lb male, approximately 290 cm, was also
sampled and the testicular lobules packed with spermatozoa and the lobular walls were
darkly stained and thick with cysts in different stages of spermiogenesis. Both male and
female were sexually active.
Behavior
Behavioral data collected by a PSAT tag allowed further analysis of what I saw in
the histology from the Gulf of Mexico. On the same longline set that caught three of the
four fish sampled histologically, a live fish was tagged and released. Approximately two
months later it popped up and started transmitting data back to the TRCC. The tag came
up about 90 miles from where it was released. Depth and temperature recordings showed
normal tuna behavior (moving up and down through the water column and consequently
encountering a variety of water temperatures) from March 21 to May 9 (Fig. 10). From
May 9 until the pop up date (May 20), depth records show that all of the fish's time was
