Bluefin
Female bluefin from New England (7-38) ranged from 193 cm to 264 cm (curved
fork length). None of the fish sampled were sexually active and the ovaries contained
oocytes averaging 65 um in diameter (ranging from 20-120 um) and all in the unyolked
stage of development. A few fish contained a low frequency of atresia suggesting that
these fish were mature, however, this resorption was considered incidental and not
indicative of sexual activity. Males ranging from 200 cm to 274 cm (n-62) also showed
no signs of sexual activity. No signs of active spermiogenesis were apparent and the
lobular lumen were completely devoid of sperm (Fig. 7B).
Female bluefin from North Carolina (7-5) ranged from 163 cm to 240 cm. Some
fish did not have either curved length or mass recorded. Missing data was filled in using a
regression from NMFS (unpublished data). None were classified as sexually active. Due
to poor histology, differences between immature and mature (inactive) could not be
distinguished. One ovary contained a very low level of a atresia but no sign of yolk
development. This atresia was considered incidental and not indicative of sexual activity.
Males (7=5) were all sexually inactive as well.
Female bluefin from the Gulf of Mexico (n-4) ranged from 217 cm to 239 cm.
Each fish represented a successive stage of ovary development. One fish (217 cm) had an
ovary containing large unyolked oocytes including the intermediate stage prior to
vitellogenesis (Fig. 4B) and a low frequency of incidental atresia but did not appear to be
sexually active. The other three all were sexually active but with subtle differences of
ovarian development. One fish (220 cm) had ovaries containing early yolked oocytes (Fig.
