1) Immature- Lobules relatively thin with a homogeneous stage of cysts in early
development (spermatogonium). A minimal amount of variety in the stages of
spermiogenesis may be present. Little or no spermatozoa in lobular lumen and
central longitudinal sperm duct (vas deferens).
2) Mature, Inactive- No prior description existed because only seen in bluefin.
Very similar to immature. Spermatozoa present in the lobular lumen. Lobules
small and narrow surrounded by 2 30% somatic tissue.
3) Active-Lobules large with thick, darkly staining walls representing all stages of
spermiogenesis. Lumen and vas deferens packed with spermatozoa.
4) Spawning- Same as mature classification but vas deferens empty.
Many of the histological samples were not complete cross-sections and therefore the vas
deferens was not available to determine between non-spawning and spawning mature fish.
In this case the lobules were used to determine if the fish was active or not and the sample
was noted as incomplete.
Results
GSI
Female yellowfin held in captivity at the TRCC seemed to show a great deal of
variation in the GST's as well as a general trend for higher GSI's with greater lengths (Fig.
2B). When compared to data from wild fish however, all values were significantly low.
