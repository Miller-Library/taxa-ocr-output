Upon death, gonads were extracted and weighed. A cross-section from one gonad
was preserved in 10% formalin buffered with 0.1 M cacodylate and stored at 4° C.
Another, larger cross-section was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a VWR brand 50
mL plastic falcon tube at-80°C. One of the two gonads was placed in a Zip-lock plastic
bag and refrigerated for later examination.
The samples of wild Atlantic bluefin were taken from a variety of locations.
Gonad samples for histology were taken from purse seine vessels in New England (n-99
during the fall, sport fishing boats in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (n-16) in the winter,
longlines in the Gulf of Mexico (n-4) in March 1999, and by sport fishermen in the
Bahamas (7-2) in April 1999. Gonad samples from the Bahamas came from an
unrevealed source because they were caught illegally. They were first preserved in gin by
the fishermen and then sent to Dr. Barbara Block via NMFS officials. These samples were
then transferred to 10% formalin buffered with 0.1 M cacodylate. All other samples were
collected by the staff of the TRCC and various sport fishermen and gonad cross-sections
were preserved in 10% formalin buffered with 0.1 M cacodylate. All histological tissues
were embedded in parrafin, sectioned at 10 um and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin.
GSI
Gonosomatic Indices (GSI's) represent the percentage of overall body weight that
is gonad weight and were calculated using the following equation: [(gonad mass) (body
mass))' 100. This gave a rough indication of the state of maturity. The GSI's were
calculated for every sampled fish with enough data and then plotted against the length of
