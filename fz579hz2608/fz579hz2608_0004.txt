spawning sites have been proposed but very little evidence exists for any kind of sexual
activity outside of the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. Western Atlantic bluefin are
seasonally distributed along the American coast from 60° N to 20° N and spawning season
in the Gulf lasts from April through June (Rivas 1954, Baglin 1982, McGowan and
Richards 1989). Based on tag returns, the mixing between stocks is believed to be
approximately 5% (Calaprice 1986). A preliminary study on the degree of spawning site
fidelity (Nemerson et al. 1998) has shown no significant mixing between the spawning
grounds. Because the literature regarding these questions is sparse, studies utilizing new
technologies are continuing to reveal new behaviors. The amount of spawning site fidelity
and inter-stock mixing is currently being determined by tagging projects using pop-up
satellite archival tags (PSAT) and internal archival tags (Block et al. 1998). To be most
efficient in deploying the tags, these projects target only sexually mature fish that will be
going to the spawning grounds within the year. Since the literature regarding the age at
which bluefin first become sexually mature contains a great deal of variation, I felt that
further investigation was necessary.
Baglin (1982) presents the most extensive study to date of the reproductive
biology of the western stock. He saw very little evidence of sexual maturity in age 1-7
year old bluefin in the Mid-Atlanic Bight. The only area where sexually active bluefin
were found was in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Straits. This study was later criticized
by Clay (1990) due to its relatively low sample sizes in different regions and seasons.
Data collected by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) observers in the Gulf
of Mexico show that bluefin are caught only during spawning season and that only fish
