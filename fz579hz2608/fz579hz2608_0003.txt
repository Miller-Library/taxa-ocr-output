Introduction
Tuna are an epipelagic group of fish (family Scombridae) that inhabit every major
ocean and support commercial and sport fisheries around the world. They are known for
their unique physiological traits which include a hydrodynamic shape, high degree of
endothermy, as well as counter-current heat exchangers (Carey 1969). In some species
such as the Atlantic bluefin tuna, these characteristics allow them to migrate thousands of
miles from warm temperate spawning grounds to food-rich colder waters. Despite the
intriguing physiology and economic importance of these species, mysteries still remain
about their biology and behavior, especially the reproductive dynamics which are crucial
for assessing stock structure and managing the respective fisheries. Although scombrid
fishes all have extremely similar stages of sexual development, the factors that govern this
development are different for each species. The species considered in this study include
the Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus thynnus) the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus
albacares) and the Easter Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis).
Atlantic bluefin tuna are most reknown for their large sizes (up to 600 kg) and for
endothermy which allows them to spend extensive amounts of time in colder waters.
Mainly due to overfishing, there has been a drastic decline in the bluefin stocks (-10% of
1975 levels). They are currently managed as two separate stocks. The eastern stock
spawns in the Mediterranean at approximately 5-6 years of age or 150 cm (Rodriguez-
Roda 1967) and the western stock spawns in the Gulf of Mexico at approximately 8-10
years of age or 190-205 cm (NRC report 1994, Baglin 1982). Recently, alternative
