in the southern hemisphere from the equator to central Chile (35Â° S). Sarda chiliensis is
replaced by another species (Sarda orientalis) in the tropical waters west of Central
America. S. chiliensis is further classified into northern and southern subspecies (S.
chiliensis lineolatus and S. chiliensis chiliensis respectively). Bonito attain sexual
maturity after two years of age and spawning season coincides with summer months as the
water temperatures rise (Collette and Nauen 1983). Goldberg and Mussiett (1984) and
Barrett (1971) found the smallest mature females of S. c. chiliensis ranged between 48.5
cm and 51.0 cm standard fork length (SFL). Bonito are known to spawn in captivity
(Magnuson and Prescott 1966) and were examined in this study because they exhibited
spawning behavior and eggs have been found in filters of the Monterey Bay Aquarium
(MBA) and the Tuna Research and Conservation Center (TRCC).
The major objective of this study was to perform a comparative examination of
scombrid reproductive biology using species with distinct behavioral characteristics both
in the wild and in captivity. The goal was to use the records of captive fish as a tool to
learn the stages of sexual maturity in all scombrids. The assumption was that
characteristics of reproductive histology are conserved among the different members of
this family. I coordinated both gross anatomical and histological observations,
length/age/weight regressions, and gonosomatic indices, in order to give a preliminary
assessment of the best technique to determine a mature fish. Using this information,
tagging projects will know more conclusively what size class to target and how to
interpret data received back from different sizes of fish.
