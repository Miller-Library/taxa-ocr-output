not spawn, nor do they become sexually active when held in 20Â°C water. Other factors
hypothesized to have an effect on sexual activity (such as food availablility and salinity)
are apparently less important factors. I found that even though diet has been variable over
the four years of keeping female yellowfin in tanks, even the samples that had been fed a
high fat, high calorie diet do not become sexually active. Males on the other hand seemed
to show no response to the environmental conditions around them. Even when fed the
current low calorie, low fat diet at the TRCC, sexual activity coordinated with the
expected sizes at maturity.
Wild bluefin tuna appear to show similar responses to SST. Ovaries from the
northern fish in colder waters regress to an inactive state and are practically
indistinguishable from immature fish. Occasionally, a low frequency of incidental atretic
oocytes are apparent which may be the only way to determine the difference between an
immature and a mature but inactive bluefin in the temperate part of their range. This
technique is not dependable though, since such a low frequency of resorbing oocytes
means that a 10 um cross-section may not include this stage. Consequently female bluefin
from New England and North Carolina appeared similar to the tuna kept in cold water at
the TRCC. Male bluefin from these regions looked like the immature yellowfin at the
TRCC.
The difference between male and female yellowfin is perhaps due to the relative
investment of energy of each sex. Schaefer (1998) estimated that a female yellowfin in the
wild, releases approximately twice her body weight in spawn each year. It would be
detrimental to release such a large investment into conditions that are not conducive to
