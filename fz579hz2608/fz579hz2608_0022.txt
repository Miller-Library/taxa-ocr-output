held in captivity, in water temperatures below what they usually encounter in the wild, do
not spawn. Female yellowfin do not become sexually active in water temperatures of 20°C
but males do, with no apparent deviation from the size ranges found in the wild. Bonito
become sexually active and spawn continuously when held in captivity in the same water
temperatures (20°C). Atlantic bluefin (both male and female) found in the northern part of
their range are in a sexually inactive state and only become active when they migrate to the
spawning grounds. Only fish 200 cm and over make this migration. Upon arrival, a
certain amount of time is required to develop into a spawning state. This time period is
unknown but recent tag data shows it may be as long as two months.
In the future, the captive fish can be used in further sexual development
experiments by altering the water temperatures and diets in the tanks. Histologically, wild
sample sizes can be increased and taken from different regions at different seasons.
Finally, more tagging data is still being recovered and these results should elucidate the
questions of spawning site fidelity, mixing between stocks and migratory habits of the
giant bluefin tuna.
