Captive male yellowfin ranged from 53.7 cm/1 g to 113 cm/44 g and 105 cm/103.8
(curved length/ gonad mass). From the sub-sample (7-15) 12 fish were longer than the
length at which 50% are mature (69.0 cm, Schaefer, 1998) and 6 were longer than the
length at which 90% are mature (89.8 cm). At least 9 fish were mature and active (Fig.
7C), the rest were classified as immature with various stages of teste development (Fig.
7A). No male fish were examined from warmer waters.
Bonito
Curved lengths for female samples ranged from 57 cm to 65 cm, all larger than the
smallest mature fish found by Barrett (1971) and Goldberg and Mussiett (1984), 51 cm
and 48.5 cm respectively. One of the female bonito was classified as sexually inactive and
3 as sexually active (7â€”4). Only one of the active fish was classified additionally as
spawning. This ovary included advanced yolked and atretic oocytes (Fig. 4D,E,F) as well
as some hydrated oocytes (Fig. 6A) indicating imminent spawning, however, the low
frequency of hydrated stage oocytes and the absence of the migratory nucleus stage
suggest either past spawning (more than 24 h ago, allowing the follicles to be completely
resorbed) or a narrow window of time prior to spawning in which hydrated but not
migratory nucleus stage are apparent. Male bonito were all mature (7-5) but not spawning
(Fig. 7C). Curved lengths ranged from 61 cm to 67 cm which were greater than the
smallest reproductively active male (39 cm) found by Goldberg and Mussiett (1984). Past
spawning in males can only be determined 12 h after the event because the vas deferens
refills with spermatozoa almost immediately (Schaefer 1998).
