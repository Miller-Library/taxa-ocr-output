egg and larval growth. Males however, donâ€™t have as much invested in their gonads and
can afford to have them ready to spawn at all times. The surprising result of this study is
the difference between yellowfin males and bluefin males. In contrast to yellowfin, bluefin
males are not sexually active when in the colder part of their range. This suggests that
neither temperature nor food availability play a role in male sexual development. Rather,
yearly cycles based around customary migration patterns seem to be more reasonable as
determining factors for sexual state.
If the hypothesis that only mature bluefin come to the Gulf of Mexico and they are
there to spawn is correct (Nemerson 1998), the most intuitive way to determine the size of
sexual maturity is to look at the size of the fish arriving in the Gulf. Size-catch statistics
have been collected on the Japanese longline industry and by NMFS landings for more
than 30 years. According to this data, few fish (0.4 percent, Nemerson et al. 1998) are
caught during the breeding season under approximately 135 kg and 185-200 cm (Fig. 9)
This size frequency is consistent even before 1982, when a minimum size limit for the
retention and sale of small bluefin was established which may have led to an under-
reporting of smaller fish. It is possible that due to the limited extent of bluefin targeted
fishing, smaller fish were missed. Considering the more than thirty year history of the
fishery and the parallel fishery for yellowfin which targets smaller fish, the idea of a large
representation of small bluefin going completely unnoticed is unlikely. Therefore, based
on spawning ground catch statistics alone, the first length at which a majority of western
Atlantic bluefin tuna are mature and able to spawn is 200 cm, correlating to an age of
approximately 9-10 years.
