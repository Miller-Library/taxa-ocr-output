most of its cohorts were sexually active and almost ready to spawn in the beginning of the
spawning season, and 2) spawning would most likely occur in the warmest waters which is
where this fish started spending 100% of its time. The data transmission was incomplete
and many days were either incomplete or missing altogether. Nevertheless, the surface
pattern was distinct and long enough that it stood out clearly.
Taking into account the new data presented in this study, as well as the results
from previous studies, the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits still appear to be the
most significant spawning ground for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna. While this has
historically been considered the primary site, recent controversy has risen over the
speculation of alternative spawning sites (Lutcavage, 1999). My analysis shows
alternative sites are very unlikely. Although sample sizes were low in some places, the
lack of any evidence of sexual activity, let alone spawning, suggests that western bluefin
spawning grounds are confined to the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. More
sampling is needed from different seasons and if possible, from the new sites proposed as
alternatives.
My comparative analysis of the males provides some additional evidence regarding
the factors determining sexual activity. In the 20Â°C tank water, male yellowfin matured
and became sexually active at sizes equivalent to those found in the wild according to the
study done on wild yellowfin (Schaefer, 1998). Bluefin provide a contrast to this by being
sexually inactive in the northern part of its range where water temperatures are colder.
Testes can regress quickly, making the identification of mature males difficult. Male
yellowfin seem to have a different sexual response to colder water temperatures than the
