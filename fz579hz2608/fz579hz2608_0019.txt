However, if the assumptions prove to be false, if immature bluefin can show up in
the Gulf of Mexico or if another spawning ground exists, the length at maturity could
increase or decrease respectively. The four samples from the Gulf of Mexico and one
from the Bahamas that I examined all represented different stages of development towards
sexual activity. Even on the spawning grounds, in large fish (215 cm), not all were
sexually active. A female bluefin (218 cm) from the Gulf of Mexico appeared sexually
inactive and therefore I could not confidently determine if it was mature given only the
histology. The following information about this fish suggests it was mature and becoming
sexually active. First, its size correlated with the other active fish which represented the
same size/age class and were caught on the same longline. This could mean a great deal
of variation exists in length at maturity, or in the time it takes for a fish to switch from an
inactive to an active state. Related to the latter possibility is the time of year at which
these fish were captured. All bluefin from the Gulf of Mexico were taken in March, the
supposed beginning of their spawning season (Baglin, 1982; Rivas 1964). Most likely,
they had just arrived from the colder feeding grounds and were beginning to respond to
the new environment. Studies on related fish have shown the tendency of older and bigger
fish to start spawning earlier in the season and be more fecund. This theory is
questionable due to the vast differences of sexual status of three fish from the same
size/age class.
Secondly, the tag data recovered from a cohort of the fish I examined
histologically, suggests that it waited approximately 2 months before starting to spawn. I
hypothesize that the drastic change in behavior represents spawning behavior because 1)
