Abstract
Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are currently managed as two separate
stocks, one breeding in the Mediterranean Sea and the other in the Gulf of Mexico. The
fidelity of the two stocks to their respective breeding ground is currently in question. In
the Gulf of Mexico, bluefin arrive in a sexually inactive state and in some time period
ranging from weeks to months, develop into spawners. This western stock is reported to
mature at about 190-205 cm in length and about 8-10 years of age. Currently, bluefin
tuna are being tagged with pop-up satellite and archival tags, to discern their migratory
movements and philopatry to a spawning ground. My objective was to examine bluefin in
the areas they are currently being tagged, to discern the state of sexual maturity of fish in
the different regions. Specifically, I was interested in identifying 1) what is the minimum
size of first sexual activity and 2) if spawners were restricted only to the Gulf of Mexico.
Knowing which fish are mature will help to interpret the movement and behaviors revealed
by the tag data. Since scombrid fishes are closely related, other species provided a
valuable comparison. To histologically identify the stages of wild caught bluefin tuna I
compared the gonadal tissues to those of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Eastern
Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) held in captivity at the Tuna Research and Conservation
Center. Based on a classification system from previous studies, I assigned each sample a
stage of maturity. In addition, for captive fish, I collected data on gonad size at mortality,
which provided an index of gonad development for corroboration with histological
examinations. Ifound that female yellowfin tuna do not become sexually active in water
temperatures below 20Â°C, but male yellowfin do, with no apparent variation in size to first
