(Farley 1997, Schaefer 1998). The relative frequency of these stages in the ovary
provided the criteria to estimate sexual status. Females were put into one of the following
categories
1) Immature- Only unyolked oocytes present. No signs of atresia.
2) Mature, nonspawning- Advanced yolked or atretic oocytes are present but no
sign of imminent or past spawning (migratory nucleus, hydrated, or
postovulatory follicle).
3) Mature, spawning- Advanced yolked oocytes are present as well as signs of
spawning (migratory nucleus, hydrated, or postovulatory follicle). Less
than 100% of advanced yolked oocytes are in a atresia.
4) Postspawning- Either: 1) 2 50% of both early and advanced yolked oocytes are
in o atresia; 2) 100% of advanced yolked oocytes in the a stage of atresia;
3) no yolked oocytes are present but oocytes in the ÃŸ stage of atresia are,
and residual hydrated oocytes may or may not be present.
Males
Testes are considered an unrestricted spermatogonial type, meaning the
distribution of spermatogonia and stages of spermiogenesis occur along the entire lobule
Testes were classified depending on stages of spermiogenesis in the lobule walls and
presence or absence of sperm in the lobular lumen and sperm duct. Three groups were
adapted from Schaefer (1998) and Grier (1981):
