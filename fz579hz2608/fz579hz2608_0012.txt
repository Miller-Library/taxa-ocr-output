Schaefer (1998) reports that sexually active fish have GSI's of one or higher. None of the
female yellowfin in captivity had GSI's over one. Male yellowfin GSl's were also low
(Sl) and did not show any obvious trend (Fig. 2A).
Bonito GST's on the other hand, were much higher and showed a great deal of
variation. Females all had GSI's greater than one and a single individual was as high as
4.85 (Fig. 3B). Comparing these numbers to the histology, I found that a GSI between 1
and 2 indicates a mature but sexually inactive fish, a GSI of about 2 or above indicates
sexually active but not spawning, and a GSI of 4 or higher indicates a spawning bonito.
Male bonito had GST's ranging from 1.85 to 5.85 (Fig. 3A). All were sexually active but
did not appear to be spawning.
Histology
Yellowfin
Examination of histology slides from the captive female yellowfin show that none
of the fish were sexually active. Curved lengths ranged from 54.3 cm to 121 cm with 9
out of 15 over 92 cm (Schaefer's length at which 50% are mature). All oocytes were in
the unyolked stage and ranged in diameter from 20-120 um (Fig. 5A,B). There was a
slight correlation between gonad size and average oocyte diameter even though the
oocytes were all the same stage. The 3 samples from Kewalo Basin were similar except
for the biggest fish (92.3 cm). It contained a low frequency of slightly larger oocytes (140
um) with grainy cytoplasm, and light colored nuclei surrounded by lipid droplets (Fig.
4B). They appeared to be between unyolked and early yolked stage. Some possibly
atretic oocytes were also present in low frequency (Fig. 4E).
