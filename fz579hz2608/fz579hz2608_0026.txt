Fig. 9) National Marine Fisheries Service observations of the Japanese longline fishery
in the Gulf of Mexico over the last five years (1995 to 1999).
Fig. 10) Depth and temperature data from a pop up satellite archival tag (PSAT) for May
5, 1999. Readings were taken every 60 seconds and grouped into four hour blocks (6 per
day). A. Depth categories go down the y-axis of with the surface on top. Percentage of
time during a 4 h block is indicated along the x-axis. Different series represent the
different 4 h blocks during the course of the day. The gradient color scheme goes from
lightest (earliest) to darkest (latest). B. Temperature categories are scaled down the y-
axis with the hottest at the top. Similar color gradients also represent time of day.
