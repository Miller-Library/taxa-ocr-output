Materials and Methods
Tissue Sampling
Tissue samples from yellowfin were taken from fish held in captivity at the
Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) and the Tuna Research and Conservation Center
(TRCC) where detailed records of their diet and water temperature had been kept as well
as complete necropsy reports for all mortalities since 1995. Passive Induced Transponder
(PIT) tags were used to keep track of fish. These fish had been held in 20°C water (42°0).
Gonads were blotted and weighed and a small cross section was preserved in 10%
formalin buffered with O.1 M cacodylate. From these tanks, 54 males and 72 females had
complete information on sex, length, body mass, and gonad mass. A chart of the
relationship between length and gonad mass for each gender was created from necropsy
information and a regression line was fitted to the curve (Fig. 1). Samples representing
this curve were selected along with fish that stood out as either being big or having large
gonads. The total sample size for each sex was 15. In addition, 3 female yellowfin
samples were analyzed from Kewalo Basin, Hawaii, where similar size fish (ranging from
86 cm to 92.3 cm) had also been held in captivity at warmer water temperatures.
Bonito tissue samples also came from the MBA and the TRCC. Necropsy reports
for the past bonito mortalities were not as detailed as the reports for the tuna, therefore
this collection was limited to mortalities occurring during the course of this study. Bonito
that were killed in a separate physiological experiment had gonads sampled for this study.
Five females and 7 males were examined (for sizes see Table 1).
