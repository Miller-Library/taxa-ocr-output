greater than 135 kg (190 cm) migrate there. Based on this information, the current theory
is that all bluefin arriving in the Gulf are there to spawn (Nemerson et al. 1998). Rivas
(1954) gives evidence of the Florida Straits also being a spawning site, based on
behaviors, gross morphology of gonads, egg diameters, and larval surveys, but provides
no histological evidence. Bluefin taken in this region range from 135 to 320 kg (200-270
cm).
Yellowfin tuna are known to feed and spawn in tropical and subtropical regions
worldwide. They are targeted by a purse seine fishery in the Eastern Tropical Pacific
(EPO) and are harvested at an average of 216,300 metric tons per year. Schaefer (1996.
1998) has studied the yellowfin in the EPO from 30° N to 15° S with the majority of
yellowfin sampled between the equator and 20° N. In the 1998 Inter-American Tropical
Tuna Commission (IATTC) report, Schaefer describes a significant correlation between
Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and proportion of reproductively active fish in all four of
the areas sampled. Fish in spawning condition were encountered in a temperature range of
21.5° to 30.0°C, however, 85.3% of spawning occurred between 26.0° to 30.0° C.
Schaefer also determined that 50% of male yellowfin were sexually mature at 69.0 cm and
the smallest was less than 50 cm. Females were larger before becoming sexually mature,
the smallest being 59 cm and 50% were mature at 92.1 cm. Yellowfin in the EPO spawn
at night between 2200 h and 0600 h. As shown in this study, yellowfin held in 20°C water
do not become sexually active.
The Pacific bonito inhabits waters off the west coast of the Americas in the
northern hemisphere from south eastern Alaska (60° N) to the Baja peninsula (20° N) and
