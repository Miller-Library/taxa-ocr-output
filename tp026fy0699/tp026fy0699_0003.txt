METHODS AND MATERIALS
Two species of benthic algae (Iridaea flaccida and
Laminaria setchellii) and one marine plant (Phyllospadix
torreyi) were tested. These particular species were chosen
for two reasons: 1) Iridaea flaccida and Laminaria setchellii
are representative of the red and brown classes of benthic
algae, while the pigments in Phyllospadix torreyi are sim¬
ilar to those in the chlorophytes, and 2) all three species
are very common along the Monterey coast, where the study
was conducted. Samples were collected from an unpolluted
environment, cut into pieces weighing approximately 150 mg
(dry weight), and put separately into 300 ml BOD bottles.
(For both Iridaea flaccida and Laminaria setchellii, all
pieces used for one test were cut from a single leaf.) The
BOD bottles were filled with sea water which had a depressed
dissolved oxygen content achieved by bubbling with nit¬
rogen for 8-10 minutes. The bottles were then placed on
their sides in several two-gallon tubs containing water of
different turbidities, and incubated at 12° C. A light of
constant intensity was passed through a 3.5 cm. layer of
turbid water to the test bottles.
The bottles were submerged in water of three different
turbidities, and in sea water, which served as a control.
Sewage collected 1.2 meters from the Pacific Grove outfall
was used in the most turbid bath, the other two baths being
comprised of 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions of this sewage. Absorbtion
