curves were determined for samples of sewage collected at
various times of the day, and although the absorbances at
specific wavelengths varied, the absorbtion spectra were
parallel for all samples tested. A typical absorbtion curve
for sewage is illustrated in Figure 1. Since the peak
absorbtion is at 430 millimicrons, this wavelength was
arbitrarily chosen as a measurement of turbidity. The
turbidity of each bath was measured daily and adjusted by
adding newly collected sewage. (The turbidity tended to
drop after standing for longer than 24 hours.) The sewage
was changed weekly to prevent gross changes in the ab¬
sorbtion spectrum due to bacterial growth or changes in
particle size.
Both Phyllospadix torreyi and Iridaea flaccida were
submerged in the baths for one hour. Laminaria setchellii
was incubated for two hours because of its slower rate
of photosynthesis. A single test included duplicate bot¬
tles at each turbidity (all with one type of test organism),
along with duplicate bottles in the control bath. When the
test period ended, the bottles were removed from the baths
and the dissolved oxygen in the water was measured using
the Winkler method as described by Strickland and Parsons
(1968). The dissolved oxygen in the water before the test
was subtracted from the dissolved oxygen in each of the bot-
tles, each piece of algae was dried and weighed, and the
net productivity (in ml oxygen/mg dry weight/hour) was
