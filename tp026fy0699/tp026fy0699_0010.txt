was as great as 35% in turbidities approximating the tur-
bidity around the Pacific Grove sewage outfall. The efÂ¬
fects of this turbidity were also shown to differ for the
three species studied. Iridaea flaccida exhibits a greater
tolerance to sewage turbidity (except at very high values)
than do either Phyllospadix torrevi or Laminaria setchellii.
This finding is consistent with the prediction made for
the effects of sewage turbidity on red versus green or
brown algae using the action spectra of the different
types.
