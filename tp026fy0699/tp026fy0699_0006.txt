to increasing turbidity. Although the curves for Laminaria
setchellii and Phyllospadix torreyi are quite similar, they
are both very different from the Iridaea flaccida curve.
While the productivities of both Laminaria setchellii and
Phyllospadix torreyi drop in the 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions of
the sewage, the Iridaea flaccida productivity remains ap
proximately constant.
The standard deviations which occur at some of the
points in the graphs of Iridaea flaccida and Phyllospadix
torreyi are misleadingly large, since one or two highly
deviant values had a greater effect on the standard devÂ¬
iations, because there were only eight values determining
the means. With many more tests using these two organisms
the standard deviations would probably become much smaller.
The values for Laminaria setchellii ranged quite widely
and showed no indication that additional tests would sig
nificantly lower the standard deviations. A number of
features probably contributed to the undesirability of
Laminaria setchellii as a test organism. Most important,
Laminaria setchellii contains a sticky sap, which oozes out
when the leaf is cut and then traps air bubbles when the
bottle is filled. Although the bottles were filled immed-
iately after the algae was cut, some air was probably still
trapped. In addition, the very slow productivity rate of
Laminaria setchellii (approximately eight times slower than
that of Phyllospadix torreyi) maximized the errors caused
