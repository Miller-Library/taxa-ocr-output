calculated using the formula:
LB - IP
net productivity - mg dry wt.
hrs.
where LB = dissolved oxygen in the light bottle, and IB
dissolved oxygen in the initial bottle.
After several trial runs, the test was repeated ten
times with each species, and the first two runs for each
species were discarded.
RESULTS
Figures 2, 3, and 4 represent a compilation of eight
runs for each species tested. Duplicate bottles for each
test at each turbidity were averaged, so that the three final
graphs consist of eight points at each turbidity. Using
these eight points, the means and standard deviations were
calculated. The graphs show perecent of control productÂ¬
ivity versus turbidity rather than net productivity versus
turbidity because the control productivity in a single
species varied from test to test since different plants
were used. This was especially true for Iridaea flaccida.
DISCUSSION
Figures 2, 3, and 4 clearly indicate that the product-
ivities of all three species studied are effected by tur
bidity. Although the standard deviations (especially in
the case of Laminaria setchellii) are quite large, it ap
pears that the three different species respond differently
