INTRODUCTION
Observation of the floral community surrounding an
intertidal sewage outfall shows that some species of benthic
algae and marine plants are able to exist in areas of high
sewage concentrations, while other species cannot tolerate
this altered environment. However, even the most resistant
species are small and stunted in the immediate vicinity
of the outfall. Since one of the most salient characterÂ¬
istics of sewage pollution is the increased turbidity
caused by the suspended particulate matter in the sewage,
it is logical to hypothesize that the increased turbidity
effects the viability of the marine flora by reducing the
amount of light received, therefore interfering with the
normal photosynthetic process. The specific absorbtion
spectrum of the sewage may also be a factor in determining
the different tolerances of different species, since each
has a unique pigment composition
An experiment was designed to answer two questions:
1) does turbidity effect the productivity of marine flora,
and 2) does turbidity have a different effect on different
species. In all species studied the productivity decreased
markedly at high turbidities. The productivities of the
three species studied also showed differences in their rates
of decline as the turbidity increased.
