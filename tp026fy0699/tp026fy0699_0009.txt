is able to tolerate turbidity (up to a certain level) much
better than either Phyllospadix torrevi or Laminaria set
chellii.
The ability to live in turbid water caused by sewage
pollution is one reason that Iridaea flaccida, and perhaps
red algae in general, can exist in water containing high
sewage concentrations. However, turbidity is not the only
parameter involved. Many other components of sewage, or
properties of the different algal species themselves, also
help to determine resistance to sewage pollution. Roy
(personal communication) has found that several species of
red algae in the vicinity of the Pacific Grove sewage out
fall contain greater quantities of pigments (both chloroÂ¬
phylls and carotenoids) than do the same types growing
in unpolluted areas. This increased pigment concentration
could possibly be a response to a decreased amount of light
reaching the plant, due to sewage turbidity. Neither green
nor brown algae have demonstrated this property. Schreiber
(personal communication) has found that the productivity
of several types of algae is decreased by increased chlorine
concentrations in the water. Other pollutants found in
sewage may also effect productivity, and these could be
determinants of floral distribution in an outfall area.
SUMMARY
The productivities of all three species studied were
found to decrease with increasing turbidity; this decrease
