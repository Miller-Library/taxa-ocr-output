by the trapped air bubbles. In spite of the wide variation
in the results, Laminaria setchellii shows a distinct de¬
crease in productivity when the turbidity increases.
The experimental results obtained for the three spe¬
cies studied correlate well with the locations of these
three types in the vicinity of the Pacific Grove outfall
at Point Pinos. None of the species is found within a
70meter radius of the outfall, where the turbidity at low
tide ranges from .800 to 1.40 (turbidity as absorbtion at
430 millimicrons). Iridaea flaccida exists at one loca¬
tion with a turbidity of approximately .500 (the exact
turbidity could not be measured since the rock was 7 meters
offshore), and fairly commonly in areas where the tur¬
bidity was .100-.200. Neither Phyllospadix torreyi nor
Laminaria setchellii appear except at low (.100-.200)
turbidities, and all of these sites are washed from one
side by clear water.
A comparison of the absorbtion curve of sewage with
the absorbtion curves of various plant pigments present
in marine flora provides possible explanations for the
detrimental effects of sewage turbidity on these organisms
in general, and also for its different effects on the three
species studied. All three types of chlorophylls, and
most carotenoids have absorbtion peaks at 430-460 milli-
microns (Franck, 1949), which is the range of maximum ab¬
sorbtion by the sewage. Since light at this wavelength is
