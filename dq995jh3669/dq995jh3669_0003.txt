time from addition of C mixture to end point of
uncatalysed reaction
time from addition of CO, mixture to end point of cata-
lysed reaction.
It was very important that reagents and glassware be fully chilled
and that all manipulations be consis tent. For example, the assay was
sensitive to the way in which the tube was held during mixing,
probably due to heat transferred from the hands.
Because of inconsistencies, the assay was run in sets of 5 tubes:
4 identical catalysed tubes and a control. Control time varied from
180 to 225 seconds depending on how the apparatus was handled, but
with consistent handling, consistencies within 5 seconds were obtainable.
The me an tine of the 4 catalysed tubes was taken as thet for a
pa rticular concentration of enzyme and inhibitor. te was determined
in a similar way.
Attempts at enzyme purification using treatment with ethanol and
chloroform (Roughton and Booth, 18) yielded inactive preparations
from homogenates of the mantle. and gonad tissue of Mytilus californianus
and whole Tegula funebralis. Trace amounts of activity, i.e. 160 AU/ml,
were found in the non aqueous phase. Masurements reported here used
a crude 25% homogenate prepared by grinding the tissue in a mortar
and pestle or in a Waring blender. Waring blender prepared homogenates
were generally 3 times more active.
Mytilus used in these experiments were collected at Hopkins
