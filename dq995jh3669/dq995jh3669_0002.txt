I hoped to demonstrate that DDE is an inhibitor of carbonic
anhydrase and that dorbonic anhydrase of species other tharthe bovine
préeparation used by Keller is inhibited by DDT and DDE. I thought
variations of the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase between different
species might correlate with their sensitivity to DDT and DDE.
Procedure
A modification of the colormetric carbonic anhydrase assay of
Roughton and Booth (18) was used. Among various buffers, tris (hydrox¬
ymethyl) aminomethane (tris) appears the least inhibitory (19).
A .02M solution adjusted to pH 8.20 with HCl was used. All purified
enzymes and homogenates were in this buffer solution. DDT and DDE
were dissolved in dimethylformamide. Sulfanilamide was dissolved in
tris buffer. The indicator used was .003% bromothymol blue added to
CO saturated distilled water prepared with a dry ice generator. All
reagents were maintained in an ice bath. All assays were similarly
carried out at 0'c.
The following ritual was used for all assays. 9.5ml of buffer
or enzyme-buffer solution was placed in a test tube. ml of
dimethylformamide solution of DDT or DDE was added; the tube was stop-
pered, and mixed with a vortex mixer (Vortex-Genie) for 5 seconds.
The tube was incubated for 15 minutes in an ice bath to allow for rea¬
tion between enzyme and inhibitor. 5ml of C0,-indicator mixture was
quickly added using a 10 ml pipette, the tube restopped, mixed, and
returned to the ice bath. Mixing was by inverting the stoppered tube
quickly three times. The tube was mixed at the beginning of each
minute until the end point. The pipette was precooled by filling to
lOml, allowing it to drain, refilling and allowing all but 5 ml to drain
