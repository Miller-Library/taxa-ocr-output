Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. Homogenates were immediately
prepared and stored at 0C. Approximately 50% activity was lost in
twenty days. Results are presented in fig. 1,2, and 3.
Discussion
Both DDT and DDE inhibit bovine red cell carbonic anhydrase.
Between 3x10 and 15x10° moles in the assay tube produced 50% inhib¬
ition. Homogenated Mytilus mantle appeared to be unixhibited by
as high as 3x10-5 moles of DDT. Mytilus californianus taken from
Monterey Bay, California were found to contain 84 ppb of DDT and
residues (2). Sulfanilamide, an additional inhibitor of carbonic
anhydrase (5,20,21), was capable of inhibiting the mussel enzyme.
Only crude homogenates were used in the study. Inhibition of mussel
carbonic anhydrase should be studied using purified enzyme preparations.
DDT (at3x10-3 M) did not inhibit carbonic anhydrase activity
in crude homogenates of the mantle tissue of Mytilus californianus.
Sulfanilamide at 3x10-2M inhibited the Mytilus homogenates. DDT and
DDE at 10 M produced 50% inhibition of bovine red cell carbonic an¬
hydrase.
