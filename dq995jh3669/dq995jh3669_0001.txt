Inhibition of Carbonic Anhydrase
by DDT and DDE
Herbert Keller (1) found that carbonic anhydrase was inhibited
by very small amounts of DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)
ethane). Keller's method has been used in measuring small amounts
of DDT by a comparative assay to known amounts of DDT.
Now DDT and its derivatives are being detected throughout the
ecosystem (2,3,4), often at concentrations high enough to produce
inhibition of carbonic anhydrase according to the findings of this
report.
Carbonic anhydrase is found in all vertebrates and many invert¬
ebrates (5). It maintains acid base equilibria (5), promotes C0
transmission in respiration (5), and possibly is essential to some
calcification processes in birds (5,6,7,8,9,10), in mollusks (11,12),
arthropods (13) and coelenterata (corals) (14,15). A suggested mechansim
(14,15) is the following: Ca* + 2H00, Cac+ 0 0
The role of carbonic anhydrase in the calcification of mammalian bone
has been reviewed by Ellison (16) with the conclusion that the enzyme
is not important intthis process.
DDT could cause reproductive failure in birds due to thin egg
shells (3,17). No correlation has been demonstrated between DDT
inhibition of carbonic anhydrase and thin egg shells. DDE (1,1-dichloro¬
2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene) is the commonest insecticide analog
now being found in avian tissue (2,3,17) and is common in other species (2).
It has been suggested that DDE and DDT induce hepatic enzyme which
degrade steroid sex hormones in birds causing thin egg shells (3,17).
