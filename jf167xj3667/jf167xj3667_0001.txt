This study exanines metamorphosis and postmetamorphic
development of the solitary tunicate Ascidia ceratodes
(Huntsman, 1912). This account follows morphogenic
and behavioral events from larval settlement to the
fifth week of its life cycle. Previous works such as
those of Berrill (1947), Millar (1954), Scott (1952),
and Trason (1957), give accountsof larval and oozooid
development in a number of solitary and compound species.
however, a description of the growth and behavior of
Ascidia ceratodes through the first month has not
previously been done.
The abundanceof Ascidia ceratodes along the western
coast of North America (Abbott and Newberry,1980) and
its ease of growth and culture in the laboratory make
this species an interesting subject of study as has
been demonstrated by Lambert (1970) and King (1975)
who have investigated other aspects of the life cycle
of this species.
