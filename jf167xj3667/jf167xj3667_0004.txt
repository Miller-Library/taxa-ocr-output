tissue of the rudimentary organs can be seen (fig. 2-B).

and appears as a blunt elongated tissue mass parallel
with the anterior-posterior axis of the body. About
six hours later the heart, gut and two pairs of
stigmata can be seen (fig. 2-0). Tail remanantts and
sensory organs disappear by the end of the second
week.
AMPULLAE
Three ampullae form shortly after settling as
outpockets of ectodermal tissue, radiating out along
the substrate from the ventral side of the oozooid
(fig. 2-B). These elongate and remain for about one
week, after which 6-8 longer bifurcating finger like
ampullae develop by five weeks (fig. 4). At this
stage, the ampullae have heocoelic lumina in which
bloos cells can be seen circulating.
HEAE
The heart, which develops at the posterior end
of the endostyle, is almost transparent, and beats
