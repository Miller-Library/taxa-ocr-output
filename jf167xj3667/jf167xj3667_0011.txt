SUMMARY
Fertilized eggs of Ascidia ceratodes hatch in
about 24 hours. Resulting free swimming larvae
settle and begin metamorphosis 1-2 days later.
Development of the major organs involved in filter
feeding occurs 36-48 hours after settlement. Feeding
begins at 60-72 hours. Spontaneous contraction
begin at about 48 hours and contractions in response
to physical disturbance at 72 hours.
