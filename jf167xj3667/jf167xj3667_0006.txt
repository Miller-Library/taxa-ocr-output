The peripharygeal groove appears within the first week
extending from the anterior of the endostyle on the
ventral side, posteriorly to the area of the brain(fig.3-A0.
tigmata multiplication proceeds as in figure 7.
During the second week, three more stigmata are
added to the pharyngeal wall on each side of the
oozooid (fig. 3-B), two between the original proto-
stigmata and one posteriorly. By the third week
the four anterior stigmata on each side pinch off to
form a second row, and one more is added posteriorly
to make ten on each side. At this time, papillae
are forming on the interior of the pharyngeal wall,
and will eventually give rise to the internal

to move closer together towards the dorsal centerline
of the oozooid(fig. 4). During the fourth week, the
stigmata pinch off again to form four rows on each
side of the pharynx. At this point, the left and right
atrial siphons,and atrial cavities
begin to merge (fig. 5). Internal longitudinal
vessels now are visible.

The digestive tract is apparently functional
at 60-72 hours coinciding with the formation of four
