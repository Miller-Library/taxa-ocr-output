SPONTANEOUS CONTRACTIONS
Spontaneous contractions can be
observed
from the onset of ciliary action in the stigmata at
about 48 hours after settling. These contractions
occur at intervals of 30 seconds to 10 minutes, and
involve a movement in which the body of the oozooid
shortens and the oral siphon closes. Similar enntÂ¬
ractions in response to physical diturbanceof the
oozooid are seen later in development at about 72
hours. During these contractions the cilia in the
stigmata stop beating and seem to project into the
pharynx. Beating resumes when the animal relaxes.
BOD
Y ORIENTATION
Though the oozooid rests on its ventral side
a marked tendancy to lean to thesleft is observed from
the first week after metamorphosis begins. Thus
the endostyle on the ventral side appears skewed to
the right and the dorsal lamina appears somewhat
to the left when the oozooid is viewed dorsally.
