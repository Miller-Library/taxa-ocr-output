oral tentacles. Feeding can be observed with the aid
of carmine suspensinn added to the seawater surrounding
the oozooid. Mucus sheets formed at the endostyle and
moving dorsally of each side of the interior of the
pharynx to the dorsal lamina can be seen trapping the
fine particles of carmine. The dorsal lamina is out-
lined by the carmine as the mucus sheets are formed
into a rope and passed posteriorly to the esophagus.
Feeding is thus demonstrated at about 72 hours after
settling. Particulate matter entering the oral siphon
reaches the esophagus in 1-2 minutes. Resulting
fecal pellets are released into the atrial cavity in
1-2 hours. The esophagus, located at the posterior
of the pharynx, is U-shaped and curves dorsally and
anteriorly to the stomach, which appears as a dark
sphere when filled with food particles. The intestine
passes anteriorly below the pharynx before emptying
into the right atrial cavity of oozooids less than
five weeks old. When the atrial cavities have fused,
the intestine empties into the right side of the atrial
cavity (fig. 3-5). At two weeks the pyloric gland is
visible arising as a single bifurcating duct, from
the wall of the i stomach at the junction of
the intestine (fig. 3-5). Just anterior to the pyloric
gland is a diverticulum of the intestinal wall. This
caecum is of unknown function (fig. 3-5).
