MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult specimens of Ascidia ceratodes were colÂ¬
lected from styrofoam floats in the Monterey Marina,
Monterey, California, during the months of April and
May 1981. Gametes were removed in the laboratory and
fertilization was carried out in five inch finger bowls
which were kept in running seawater at 12-1470.
About 24 hours after fertilization, hatching occured and
the free swimming larvae were transfered to shallow
pyrex baking dishes lined on the bottom with glass
slides. The slides were covered with about 2 cm of
seawater. The larvae would settle on the glass slides
in 1-2 days. The slides were then placed in open
slide racks with the backs removed, and maintained on a
sea table with enough fresh running seawater to
cover the slides. The process of metamorphosis and
development which followed was monitered with a
compound light microscope. Prolonged observations
of the oozooids on the slides was made possible
by placing the slides in a petri dish filled with
seawater, using a U-shaped glass rod to hold the slides
off of the bottom of the dish. The slides could
then be turned over for eithera dorsal or ventral
view. Drawings were made with a camera lucida.
