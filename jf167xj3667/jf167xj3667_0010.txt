The development of stigmata in Ascidia ceratodes
generally follows the outline given by Garstang (1892).
in which the stigmata are arranged in a series of
rows, placed transversly to the longitudinal axis
of the oozooid. However, the exact sequence of addition
of stigmata is somewhat different than Garstang
described. Instead of a row of six protostigmata
forming before a second row forms by transverse
division of the protostigmata, the sixth protostigma
forms after the second row appears (fig. 7).
The purpose of spontaneous contractions is not
known, but it is interesting to note that they occur
before filter feeding begins, and also before
contractions in response to physical disturbance
takes place. The latter, which may be a defense
mechanism, is more easily explained.
At the termination of this study, no gonadal
development was seen, nor was the full compliment
of stigmata formed.
