DISCUSSION
The larvae of solitary ascidians are somewhat
less developed when metamorphosis begins, than are
the larvae of most compound ascidians. As an ex¬
ample, the oozooid of the compound ascidian Distaplia
occidentalis begins feeding within 30 minutes after
settlement (Cloney,1978) while three days aré required
for Ascidia ceratodes to begin feeding. This pro-
longed period offers a good opportunity for obser¬
vations of organogenesis.
An outline of early developmental changes can
be seen on fig.6. Adhesive ampullae are the first
structures to develop, securing the oozooid to the
substrate. Further organogenesis lasts 1-2 days
before functional heart, gut and stigmata are formed.
The organs involved in filter feeding must develop
and become functional beforethe oozooid yolk store
runs out. The endostyle, peripharyngeal band, oral
and atrial siphons, active stigmata and digestive
tract all Pecome visible within hours of each other.
Actual feeding takes place 12-24 hours later. It
is interesting to note that the onset of feeding also
occurs at the time of the development of oral tent¬
acles. Feeding may coincide with the actual ppening
of the siphons which have beervisible for almost
24 hours before feeding but may be covered by a thin
layer of epidermis, or it may coincide with the development of
which
tentacles"are necessary as regulatory structures
to control the type of particulate matter takenin.
