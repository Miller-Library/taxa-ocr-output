LTAMORPHOSI
Metamorphosis takes place 1-2 days after hatching.
The free swimming larvae orient on the substrate
allowing the three anterior adhesive papillae to adhere
to the surface. This is accompanied by rapid wiggling
of the tail, which may last up to 10 minutes. When this
movement ceases and the larva is fixed to the substrate
the axial complex of the tail begins to contract
anteriorly towards the body in a process which lasts
from 20-40 minutes, (fig. 1). At the end of this
process, the axial
complex, which has folded
over on itself, appears as a ball of brown tissue at
the posterior end of the oozooid (fig. 2-A). This tisÂ¬
sue remains for 1-2 weeks before being completely
removed by phagocytic cells. The transparent cuticle
layer of the tail remains on the oozooid for up to
several hours before being washed away. At this
time, rotation of the body through about 90 degrees
occurs, after which the ventral side of the body
comes to lie parallel with the substrate. No
apparent adult organs can be seen for a period of
about the first 24 hours. During this time, the
