arythmically for the first several hours (fig. 2-C).
After this, the heart in a biphasic manner, pumping
anteriorly, the posteriorly for 20-50 beats in each
direction. After about 72 hours a visable circulation
of bloos cells can be seen in the subendostylar
vessel adjacent to the heart. At this time the
number of heart beats in each direction ranges from
50-100 with an average of about 80. The heart
elongates with time, and may be up to one fourth the
length of the oozooid at five weeks (fig. 5).
Circulation through discrete channels in the pharynx,
tunic and ampullae is easily observed at two weeks
and becomes more complex with the growth of the oozooid.
PHARYNX ANI
TIGMATA
The outline of the pharynx is visible at 24-48
hours after the beginning of metamorphosis (fig. 2-C).
At this time, two pairs of stigmata form, one on
the left side of the oozooid and one pair on the
right. Several hours later ciliary action begins
in the stigmata. The stigmata move in counterÂ¬
clockwise metachronal waves. Two atrial siphons are
present at this time, along with two searate atrial
cavities, one above each pair of stigmata. The oral
siphon becomes better defined at the anterior end of
the oozooid (fig. 2-C).
