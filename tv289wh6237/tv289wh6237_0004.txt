20°0), 3.0 ml of MgCl, in 50 mM imidazole/CI:, 0.012 g of 0.1 mM DTNB, 0.003
g of acetyl-Coenzyme A, total volume 30 ml; oxaloacetate solution: 0.053 g
oxaloacetate, 10 ml of 50 mM imidazole/CI (pH 8.2 at 20°0)) in a Varian or
Perkin Elmer Lambda 3B model spectrophotometer. Increase in DTNB
concentration was recorded at 412 nm on a Soltec Chart Model 1241 at a
speed of 10 mm/min.
Using known chart speeds and chart recordings, absorbance change per
minute was calculated and converted to IU/ g wet weight.
Results
To account for the disparity in adult size between spp. (mean length of
81mm for C. kilmeri, mean length of 37 mm for C. pacifica and no overlap of
sizes of the two populations) enzyme activity vs. size were plotted for each
tissue (adductor, foot, gill, and mantle) to test for a significant correlation
between size and enzyme activity. Linear regression analysis for these data
indicated no significant correlation between enzyme activity and size (data not
shown).
Enzyme activity data for MDH from the four tissues sampled in C kilmeri
and C. pacifica are shown in Figure 3. For MDH, the differences in enzyme
activity between C. kilmeri and C. pacifica, as measured by a model 1 anova
test followed by a Tukey HSD test, are significant at a-0.05 for the foot
(p=0.021) but not for the adductor, gill, or mantle (p=0.961, p=0.71, p=0.906).
As can be seen in Figure 3, MDH activity is higher in the foot of C. kilmeri than in
that of C. pacifica.
Enzyme activity data for CS from the four tissues sampled in C. kilmeri
and C. pacifica are shown in Figure 4. For CS, the differences in enzyme
activity between C. kilmeri and C. pacifica are significant for the adductor and
