COMPARISON OF METABOLIC POTENTIALS OF COLD SEEP
CLAMS (GENUS CALYPTOGENA) OCCURRING IN VARYING
SULFIDE ENVIRONMENTS

Abstract.- The metabolic potentials of two Monterey submarine canyon cold
seep clam species, Calyptogena kilmeri and C. pacifica, were compared using
two enzymes involved in ATP generation: citrate synthase (CS), used in
aerobiosis, and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), primarily used in anaerobiosis.
Although both species live in high sulfide environments, C. kilmeri experiences
a significantly higher sulfide concentration than C. pacifica (86 mM sulfide vs.
O.1mM sulfide). MDH and CS assays were conducted on foot, gill, mantle, and
adductor tissues from both species. Calyptogena kilmeri was found to have
lower CS activity and higher MDH activity than C. pacifica. The lower CS activity
in C. kilmeri suggests that the near anoxic environment caused by high sulfide
concentrations suppresses aerobic metabolism, favoring a high anaerobic
metabolic potential in this species.
Introduction
Sulfide-rich cold seep sites in the Monterey Submarine Canyon support
a chemosynthetic community that includes vesicomyid clams of the genus
Calyptogena. Living 1000 m below the water's surface in a highly reduced
environment devoid of sunlight, these clams depend upon endosymbiotic
bacteria, concentrated in their gills, to oxidize sulfide, and to use the energy to
drive the net fixation of CO, (Felbeck et al. 1985). This study focuses on
Calyptogena kilmeri and C. pacifica, the most abundant clam species in the
cold seep community. In a recent study, Barry et al. (Barry et al., accepted
