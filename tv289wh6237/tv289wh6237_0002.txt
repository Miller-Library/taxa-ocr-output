1996) demonstrated that the distribution of these clams is closely related to
sulfide concentrations which range from »10 mM HøS at the source of the seep
to -O mM at the periphery of the seep site. Calyptogena kilmeri is found in areas
of high sulfide concentration towards the center of seepage sites, whereas C.
pacifica is found at lower sulfide concentrations towards the fringe of seepage
sites (see Figure 1). Interestingly, there are distinct limits to these distributions.
If sulfide levels exceed - 8 mM in the center of the seep, even C. kilmeri cannot
survive (Powell and Somero 1983), leaving a barren zone (Barry et al.,
submitted 1996). At places where sulfide levels are - O mM, no clams can
exist because there is not a sufficient source of energy. The gradient of sulfide
concentrations from the center of the seep (sulfide source) to the fringe of the
seep is so severe that the sulfide levels experienced by clams can vary from 10
mM to O mM in as short a distance as 3 m (Barry et al., accepted 1996).
This study was designed to determine whether different sulfide exposure
levels in the two species were correlated with differences in metabolic potential.
Because C. pacifica lives in a zone of lower sulfide concentration than C.
kilmeri, and because sulfide is the primary source of energy for these species,
hypothesized that C. pacifica would have a lower metabolic potential than
would C. kilmeri. To test this hypothesis, two metabolic enzymes were used as
indicators of metabolic activity.
This study shows that sulfide concentrations play only a partial role in the
zonation of these species in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, and indicates
that oxygen may be a key regulating factor in the distribution of the two
congeners.
