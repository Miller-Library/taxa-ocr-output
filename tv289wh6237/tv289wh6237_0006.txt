Calyptogena kilmeri lives in a higher sulfide and lower oxygen
environment than C. pacifica, and has higher MDH activity indicative of the
anaerobic pathway and lower CS activity indicative of the aerobic pathway than
does C. pacifica. This suggests that C. kilmeri can out-compete C. pacifica in a
reduced environment, but that in a less reduced environment, the opposite is
true. Calyptogena kilmeri may be unable to survive at the low sulfide
concentrations that C. pacifica prefers, because C. pacifica has the ability to
elevate sulfide levels in blood serum by a factor of 10 to 60 times ambient
levels, while C. kilmeri can elevate sulfide levels by a factor of only 5 to 10
(Kochevar and Barry 1994). In other words, C. pacifica exploits the higher
oxygen environment by adapting to low sulfide levels. Similarly, one may
hypothesize that C. kilmeri has a more efficient mechanism for elevating internal
oxygen levels.
It may be simplistic to suggest that the only two factors controlling
Calyptogena distribution are sulfide and oxygen concentrations. This study fits
into the context of a theory suggested by Barry et al. regarding the relatively low
abundance of C. pacifica at seeps with high levels of sulfide. Barry suggests
that, assuming larval supply is sufficient, C. pacifica must either be 1) intolerant
of sulfide levels greater than -1mM, 2) inhibited by low levels of oxygen
postulated for central seep locations, or 3) excluded from high sulfide sites via
competition with C. kilmeri (Barry et al., accepted 1996). This study provides
evidence that C. pacifica is indeed inhibited by low levels of oxygen, and is not
able to compete with its congener, C. kilmeri, in near-anoxic environments.
