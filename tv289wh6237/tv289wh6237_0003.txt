METHODS
Samples were taken from the cold seep site known as Clam Field in the
Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon (see Figure 2) using the remotely operated
vehicle Ventana, operated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI). The clams were collected from the canyon floor at a depth of
-1000 m by the mechanical arm of the Ventana. Once the clams were brought
to the surface, the height, length, and width of each were measured, and they
were held at 0°C until transported to a -70°C freezer at Hopkins Marine Station.
Six C. kilmeri and four C. pacifica were assayed for both MDH and CS
activity in the adductor, foot, gill, and mantle tissues. The protocol for the
preparation of the homogenate for each enzyme assay was similar. The
adductor, foot, gill, and mantle tissues were dissected on ice to retard protein
denaturation and subsequent loss of enzyme activity. Approximately 0.1 g of
each tissue were placed in separate Duall glass homogenizers. Each tissue
was diluted 10x by adding 20mM imidazole/CI (pH of 7.1 at 20°0) to each
sample. Once the tissues were homogenized, approximately 10 mL of each
homogenate were placed in an Eppendorf centrifuge tube and spun in a
Eppendorf Centrifuge 5402 at 4°C at 1400 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant
was decanted from each homogenate and stored on ice until assayed.
MDH activity measurements were made by adding 10 ul of enzyme
supernatant to 2 ml of assay solution (20.0 ml of 200 mM imidazole/CL (pH 7.1
at 20°0), 0.0015 g oxaloacetate, 0.0053 g NADH, deionized water to bring
volume to 50.0 ml) in a Varian or Perkin Elmer Lambda 3B model
spectrophotometer. Decrease in NADH concentration was recorded at 340 nm
on a Soltec Chart Model 1241 at a speed of 15 cm/min.
CS activity measurements were made by adding 50 ul of enzyme
supernatant to 2 ml of assay solution (25.5 ml of 50 mM imidazole/CI (pH 8.2 at
