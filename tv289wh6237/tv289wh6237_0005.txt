the mantle (p20.001, p=0.001), but not for foot or gill (p-0.992, p-0.501). As
can be seen in Figure 4, CS activity is higher in the adductor and mantle of C.
pacifica than in that of C. kilmeri.
Discussion
The hypothesis put forth in the introduction, that sulfide concentrations
control Calyptogena distribution, leads to the prediction that C. kilmeri should
have higher enzyme activity for both MDH and CS. However, the results of this
study show that this relationship does not hold. The inverse relationship
between CS and MDH activity in Calyptogena spp. suggests that the
relationship between sulfide concentration and metabolic potential is more
complex than initially thought, and indicates that C. kilmeri and C. pacifica may
pursue different metabolic strategies. Although MDH and CS are both
metabolic enzymes, they play different roles. Malate dehydrogenase is
primarily involved in anaerobiosis, whereas CS is involved in aerobiosis. This
difference in position in the metabolic pathway, combined with their different
activity patterns in the two spp. suggests that variability in environmental oxygen
levels plays a key role in species zonation.
Oxygen levels at the cold seep sites are very low (20.5 ml of Ö2/L sea
water vs. surface water oxygen levels of 6-7 ml of Ö2/L sea water) because the
cold seeps are within the oxygen minimum zone (ÖMZ). In addition, the high
levels of sulfide at the seep sites reduce the already low oxygen levels to even
lower concentrations. The combined effect of the ÖMZ and the reducing power
of sulfide results in O2 concentrations that vary from 0 ml of Ö2/L sea water in
the center of the seep to 0.5 ml of Ö2/L sea water where the concentration of
hydrogen sulfide is O mM.
