NTRODUCTION
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Epitonium tinctum : Exact'>Epitonium tinctum</span> (Carpenter, 1864) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Epitonium indianorum : Exact'>Epitonium indianorum</span> (Carpenter, 1864)
are two small marine mesogastropods often associated with sea anemones. Thorson
(1957, p. 57) reported commonly finding <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. tinctum</span> at the base of the anemone <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Antho : Exact'>Antho¬</span>
<span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>Pleura xanthe</span>
rammica (Brandt, 1835); Hochberg (1971, p. 23) described E. tinctum
feeding on the tentacles of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura elegantissima : Exact'>Anthopleura elegantissima</span> (Brandt, 1835). I have made
further observations which suggest that E. tinctum and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>E. indianorum</span> feed selectively
on the tentacles and sometines the verrucae of the particular anemone species
with which they are associated.
An experiment involving a choice between moving toward or away from an anemone
implies that Epitonium tinctum and E. indianorum use a chemosensory method to lo-
cate anemones, and can differentiate between anemone species with the method.
Epitonium species produce a purple dye from the hypobranchial gland area;
Lönnberg (1932, p. 10) extracted the dye from <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Scalaria clathrus : Exact'>Scalaria clathrus</span> (Linnaeus) and
found it to have an absorbtion spectrum consistent with a carotenoid. Perhaps part-
ly due to speculation by P. David (c.f. Wilson and Wilson, 1956, p. 292) that the
purple dye of lanthina janthina (Linnaeus) anesthetizes the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Velella velella : Exact'>Velella velella</span> (Linn-
aeus) on which it feeds, Robertson, (1963, p. 51) suggests that the dye produced
by Epitonium species may be an anesthetic. I have found that both Epitonium tinctum
and E. indianorum produce a substance in the pallial area which inhibits the com¬
pound action potential of nerve axons and affects the spontaneous rhythm and con¬
traction to a stimulis of an anemone tentacle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Epitonium tinctum were collected intertidally at Mussel Point, Monterey Bay
California; predominantly on the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, and less fre-
quently on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura xanthogrammica : Exact'>Anthopleura xanthogrammica.</span> Epitonium indianorum were collected from

thirty to eighty feet deep off Mussel Point and at the Pinnacles, near Pescadero
Point, Monterey County, California, on and near the anemones <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tealia lofotensis : Exact'>Tealia lofotensis</span>
(Gosse, 1858) and <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tealia crassicornis : Exact'>Tealia crassicornis</span> (Gosse, 1858). E. tinctum were sometimes
found on shallower <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tealia : Exact'>Tealia,</span> and E. indianorum were found only rarely on <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Anthopleura : Exact'>Anthopleura.</span>
All collections were made in May, 1975.
For experiments on chemosensory perception, two approximately seven liter
tanks were set up, one containing an anemone and one without. The tanks were con¬
nected by rubber tubing to a glass Y tube so that one branch of the Y received water
from the anemone's tank and the other received water from the control. Sea water
constantly flowed through the system; flow rate of the water entering each branch
of the Y tube was approximately five ml. per minute,
Epitonium were placed in the function of the branches of the Y tube; their
position was then recorded after fifteen minutes. Five sets of experiments were
run, in which the motion of Epitonium tinctum and E, indianorum were compared for
Anthopleura elegantissima, Anthopleura xanthogrammica, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Metridium senile : Exact'>Metridium senile</span> (Verrill, 1865)
ealia lofotensis, and Tealia crassicornis. In each case but T, crassicornis,
anemones with a wet weight of about thirty grams were used; the smallest <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>T. crassi¬</span>
cornis I had weighed about sixty grams. Five E. tinctum and five E, indianorum
were used in each set of experiments; each was given two runs, for a total of ten
readings for each species. In a control, they were tested when neither tank con¬
tained an anemone.
To test for a possible toxin or anesthetic, two sets of experiments were
carried out. First, Epitonium were crushed in frog Ringers solution and the
effect of this tested on the compound action potential of the sciatic nerve of the
leopard frog, <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rana pipiens : Exact'>Rana pipiens;</span> since this nerve's properties are well understood. The
nerve was placed over a set of silver stimulating electrodes, and two sets of
recording electrodes, one on either side of a plastic well which contained the

suspected toxin. Supra-maximal stimuli were delivered by a Grass SD-5 stimu¬
lator; the resulting compound action potential was amplified by a Grass P-8 pre¬
amplifier and displayed of a Tektronix 502-A Dual Beam Oscilloscope. (Kao and Fuhr-
man, 1967, p. 27). The ratio between the peaks from the two sets of electrodes
was recorded before and at intervals after the toxin was added, and the oscillo¬
scope image was photographed before and after the toxin had taken effect. This
method makes it possible to compare the action potential of a nerve which has been
treated with toxin to the potential of the untreated portion of the same nerve at
the same time. The effect of crushed whole Epitonium, of the crushed pallial area

in a total of 2000 ml. of ringers solution. Both E. tinctum and E. indianorum were
used.
To test the effect of Epitonium extract on an anemone tentacle, a <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Tealia : PartialExact'>Tealia crassi¬</span>
cornis tentacle was severed, and the tip attached to a Grass FT:03 force transducer,
The signal from the transducer was amplified by a Grass 5P1C pre-amplifier and re¬
corded on a Grass S2-925-T oscillograph with a Grass polygraph DC amplifier, model
5B. The base of the tentacle was attached to a small piece of capillary tubing
which had been widened at the distal end; the other end of the tube was slid over
the tip of a syringe needle. The needle was affixed to a glass rod and connected
to a 1.0 ml. syringe by a 6 cm. piece of 1/8 in. rubber tubing. The attached syringe
was used to withdraw water from the tubing; injections of Epitonium toxin, tryp-
tamine hydrochloride, or water were made with other syringes into the extreme top
of the rubber tubing. It was found in a subjective test that little dilution of a
dye occurred when it was forced through the system in this method,
Tryptamine, in .05 ml. doses at a concentration of 10" was used to enhance
the quick response of the tentacle to stimulés. Ross,(19, p. ) showed that tryp¬
tamine enhanced the quick response of column and sphincter muscles; it appears to
do so for tentacles also. I was unable to consistently get the tentacle to

contract in response to electrical stimulus; the responses noted in the exper¬
iment are the effect of Epitonium toxin on the spontaneous rhythm of the tentacle
and on the contraction due to physical and chemical effects of injections and
to touching. Whole Epitonium crushed in sea water waere used.
RESULTS
Feeding Behavior
Epitonium tinctum and Epitonium indianorum selectively feed on the tentacles
and sometimes the verrucae of specific anemone species; E. tinctum mainly on Antho¬
pleura elegantissima and somewhat less on <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. xanthogrammica;</span> E. indianorum almost
exclusively attacking Tealia lofotensis and T. c
rassicornis. Neither Epitonium is
a permanently attached parasite on an anemone; I have found large E. indianorum in
cracks a foot away from an anemone in the field, and both species often crawled
around in the tank.
When feeding, <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Epitonium tinctum : PartialExact'>Epitonium tinctum may</span> position itself on the column, on shell
fragments or pebbles on the column of an anemone, or by the base of a small anemone.
Quite often, Epitonium crawling on the column of an anemone may have the foot stained
by the purple dye they produce. The Epitonium everts and extends up its long pro¬
boscis, which it brandishes about until it encounters the tip of a tentacle; if it
touches another part of the anemone, such as the column or even the midsection
of the tentacle, the proboscis is quickly lifted and continues to explore. When
the tip of a tentacle is contacted, theEpitonium slides its proboscis over it and
appears to saw it off with its radula. The anemone remains open until just before
the proboscis, with the bitten-off tentacle visible within, is retracted, when
it may partially close,
Tealia species don't cover themselves with shell fragments; perhaps for this
reason, Epitonium indianorum is not often found far above the base of Tealia's
column. Otherwise, E. indianorum feeds on Tealia lofotensis in basically the same

manner as E. tinctum on Anthopleura. Tealia crassicornis is a large anemone
Epitonium toxin p
Sigrid Salo
E. indianorum usually attacks the verrucae from a spot on the base of the column.
I have not found an Epitonium on Metridium senile, nor did the Epitonium
crawl on the <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Metridium : Exact'>Metridium</span> in the tank. Rarely, however, one would attack the tentacles
of a small Metridium from a position near the base of the anemone; this is not
possible with a larger Metridium.
Chemosensory Experiment

If an Epitonium in a Y tube - exposed from one branch of the tube to water
from a tank containing an anemone, the prevalent direction of motion of the Epitonium
Das
is changed from the direction when there was no anemone present. Thus, there must
be a water soluble substance released by anemones which Epitonium can sense and
use to indicate anemone presence.
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Epitonium : PartialExact'>Epitonium may</span> respond in two ways to the presence of anemone; they may exhibit
affinity for the anemone by moving toward it, or they may avoid the anemone either
by moving away from the source of the odor by moving down the Y with the current.
or by moving away from the odor of aneomne by moving to the side, against the current
up the other fork of the Y.
From 10% to 40% of the Epitonium moved less than .5 cm in any direction, and
were assingned a movement of O for the experiment. The percentage of Epitoniun
„da lack a r
not moving was decreased in the presence of an anemone, but as  could be due
to not sensing the anemone, or to being in a favored concentration of odor where
they were, or perhaps other factors; I am unsure of how to evaluate the numbers,
Oap
Os would be expected, Epitonium showed affinity toward those anemones with
which they are usually associated. E. tinctum has a wider distribution than E.
indianorum, and this is manifested in the fact that it shows a more general affinity
toward anemones. Neither Epitonium is found on or exhibits affinity for Metridium
senile.

Towin/Anesthetic
Effects on Nerve Action Potential

The size of the compound action potential of the nerve was decreased by
the Epitonium toxin; in this case the ratio of the peak recorded at the site on
the nerve after the toxin well to the peak recorded before the well decreased from
4.2/3.3=1.27 to 1.1/3.9=.39. Thus there is some water soluble substance in
Epitonium which is capable of inhibiting the ability of the nerve to conduct an
impulse; perhaps by affecting ion transport across the nerve membrane. Note that
the positive after-potential of the nerve was abolished. The speed of conduction
of the impulse was slowed; the distance between the two peaks has increased. Some
of the nerve fibers were extinguished faster than others; the potentials of the
faster conducting nerves was extinguished and the peak broadened.
The toxin used in this experiment had been dialysed for twelve hours ågainst
a total of 2000 ml. Ringers solution. Epitonium toxin also inhibited the nerve
after being dialysed for twenty-four hours. Thus, it is either a large molecule,
such as a protein, or is altached to a large molecule.
Nu a
JThe action potential was inhibited by the presence of a solution from the
<span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Epitonium : PartialExact'>Epitonium pallial</span> region, but was not affected by an extract from the rest of
the body. The toxin is either produced or stored in the pallial region, possibly
the hypobranchial gland.

on Contraction of Anemone fentacles
Lgvnd 347
For a period of 18 minutes following the injection of Epitonium extract into
a tentacle, both the inherent contractions and the contractions in respose to stin¬
ulus were abolished, even when the tentacle had been sensitized by tryptamine,

The spontaneous contractions returned after the 18 minutes, the contractions
in response to stimilus did not,
DISCUSSION
This paper has reported evidence that an extract from the pallial region
of Epitonium is toxic to the nerve of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Rana : Exact'>Rana</span> pipiess, less concrete evidence that
Epitonium inhibits tentacle contraction. A toxin or anesthetic produced by Epi
tonium could be useful in two ways ; it could be used to desensitize the column
of the anemone over which the Epitonium walks, or it could anesthetize the ten¬
tacle on which the Epitonium is feeding, in which case the Epitonium would need
a quick method of applying the toxin. Robertson (1963, p. 51) mentions that some
Epitonium possess hollow thorns which may be used to inject a toxin; I did not
find such thorns or a duct in the proboscis originating in the pallial area
which might be used to carry toxin. Thus, because of this, and because I have
seen dye (which is also produced in the pallåal area) on the foot of Epitonium,
would suggest that the toxin or anesthetic is used generally to desentize the
anemone on which the Epitonium rests,
SUMMAR
Epitonium tinctum and E. indianorum are two mesogastropods which feed pre-
dominantly on the tentacles of various anemones. Laboratory experiments show that
they may locate anemones using a chemosensory method. Both produce a purple dye,
which may be a carotenoid; and both produce a toxin or anesthetic which isweither
a large molecule or is attached to a large molecule. The toxin inhibits the com¬
pound action potential of the sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens and also the con¬
tractions of a tentacle from Tealia crassic

Of the many people who helped me with this work, I would especially like
to thank Dr. F.A. Fuhrman for many suggestions and an awesome store of patience, and
Dr. Myra Keen for use of the Stanford shell collection for identification of
Epitonium species.
