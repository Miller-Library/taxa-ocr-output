benchmarks nearby, so elevations were determined by establishing
tidal level at the time of low low water on a very calm day, and
then measuring intertidal heights relative to this value.
Orientations of the substratum faces upon which limpets were
found were measured by compass and then corrected according to
the declination of the Monterey area. The direction from which
waves were coming relative to each study area was also recorded in
this manner.
The slope of substrate, measured with an inclinometer, was
categorized as being: 1) horizontal, 0 - 30째 2) intermediate,
31 - 59째 3) vertical, 60 - 90째 4) overhanging, greater than 90째.
Presence in crevices was also recorded.
RESULT
Out of 720 limpets observed, the vertical range extends from
f.7 to t3.2 meters over all exposure conditions (Figure 1). The
average density occurs at .27 meters below the Endocladia zone,
which gives a comparative physiological level between sites.
Small standard deviations indicate that the greatest limpet density
actually occurs over a much narrower range. Greater densities of
C. paradigitalis were also found in the more protected areas.
Substrate orientation data indicates a preference for NW and
SE facing rocks (Figure 2), while a closer look suggests that
limpets may orient themselves according to the degree of wave action
they are receiving. Figure 3 compares the number of limpets facing
into the waves with the number facing away from the waves (i.e.,
limpets on the front vs. back sides of rocks). Rocks facing intod
