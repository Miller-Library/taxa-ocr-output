species (Table 2, bottom).
Figure 7 is a graph which correlates limpet size with average
displacement at high tide. Limpet shell sizes ranged from 8./ to
16.0 mm with average displacement ranging from 3.2 to 22.9 cm per
high tide. The point with the hatched circle is believed to be
an error.
No significant trends were observed when displacements
resulting from night high tides were compared with day highs, of
when high high tides were compared with low high tides.
DISCUSSION
The distribution of C. paradigitalis suggests that the species
is not as resistant to desiccation stress as the higher intertidal
limpets such as C.scabra and C. digitalis whose niches were described
by Stoner B. Haven, 1973, and physiological tolerances determined
for them by Walcott, 1973. This assumption is reinforced by its
tendency to occupy vertical faces, crevices, tidepools, and areas
which face toward the waves in protected areas, all positions
which would reduce desiccation stresses and maximize water retention.
C. paradigitalis can commonly be found low on the rocks buried in
the sand after receding tides, a very protected environment which
is moist, dark, and safe from possible predation by starfish or
birds (Hahn, 1982).
Physiological factors are not the sole determinants of the
distribution of C. paradigitalis. The decrease in density of
C. paradigitalis in areas exposed to heavy surf suggests that it may
