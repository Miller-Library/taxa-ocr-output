SUMMARY
Distribution
1) Vertical distribution: .7 - 3.2 meters above MLLW with average
density .27 meters below Endocladia zone.
2) Wave exposure: greatest densities occur in protected areas where
more face into the waves than in exposed areas.
3) Orientation of substrate: main density of organisms facing
toward NW or SE. NW density faces into the waves in protected
areas. SE density faces away from waves in exposed areas.
4) Slope of substrate: 912 of sample population found on
vertical or slightly overhanging surfaces.
5) Crevices: 552 of population found in crevices.
Activity patterns
1) Average distance moved during high tide = 13.4 cm.
2) Approximately 772 of the population moves greater than 5 om during
a high tide.
3) Homing ranges with radii from 8 to 80 cm have been determined
with the average between 20 and 25 cm.
4) A correlation exists between the size of a limpet and its average
distance moved per high tide. The larger the limpet, the greater
the travelling distance.
5) Very infrequent homing in 672 of the population.
