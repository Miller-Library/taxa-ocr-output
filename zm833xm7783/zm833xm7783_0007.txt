suffer in competition from C. digitalis which is most similar to
it in habitat niche, and flourishes in wave swept areas.
Competition may also be very significant in determining
orientations either facing toward or away from waves in varying
exposure conditions, which would further take it out of competition
with C. digitalis.
Substrate orientation data (Figure 2), may best be explained
by relating the directions which study sites faced with the direction
of oncoming waves. All of the study areas faced toward the ocean
in a range from NW to NE, the density of organisms facing NW is a
result of the great number of limpets facing into the waves in the
protected areas, while the density facing SE is a result of those
facing away from the waves in the more exposed areas.
Activity patterns are also strongly influenced by physiological
factors and competition.
If the distance travelled by a limpet is directly proportional
to its foraging area, Figure 5 would suggest that larger limpets
need to forage over greater distances than smaller limpets. A
foraging range or territory (example, Figure 4) would be important
in determining spatial distribution so that competition could be
minimized and grazing areas could be most efficiently utilized
at high limpet densities. If a home range exists it is possible
that limpets occasionally return to sites offering physiological
advantages which may explain why some C. paradigitalis exhibit
occasional homing behavior, a phenomenon which requires further
study.
