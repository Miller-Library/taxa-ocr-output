the waves were defined as those facing no more than 45° away from
the direction of oncoming waves, while those facing away wer defined
as being 180° opposite in orientation from those facing into the
waves.
The results indicate that more limpets are found facing
toward the waves in protected areas than in exposed areas.
Table 1 gives more information on microhabitat preference,
most notably, that over 902 of the population was found on vertical
or slightly overhanging surfaces, and also that over 502 were found
in crevices. Large numbers were also found totally submerged in
tadepools during low tides, also reported by Fritchman, 1960,
but no data was collected on these animals.
ACTIVITY PATTERNS
METHODS
All data was collected from observations made over a 2 week
period during consecutive low tides from May 11-25, 1982. The study
was conducted with a population of 18 C. paradigitalis in 2 sites
located in a very protected area on the Eastern end of Agassiz Beach
behind Hopkins Marine Station.
The 2 sites where the study was conducted were chosen because
they were typical C. paradigitalis habitats, they had relatively
flat rock surfaces so that measurements could easily be made, and
easily accessible. The position of each limpet was marked with
nail polish and numbered during low tide on the morning of May II.
At each following low tide until May 25, the location of each limpet
was recorded by using a system of polar coordinates with the origin
