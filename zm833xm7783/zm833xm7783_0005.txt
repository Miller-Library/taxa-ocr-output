at the original site of the limpet.
Elevations of the study site ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 meters
above mean low low water.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the significant behavioral findings. Movement
between low tides ranged from O to 50 cm, averaging 13.4 cm if
periods of inactivity are discounted.
932 of the population moved during high tide with the percentage
dropping sharply if only those moving greater than a certain distance
are considered.
C. paradigitalis occupies a more restricted range than would
be expected, given the average displacement at each high tide.
The ranges were found to have radii from 8 to 80 cm, typically
20 to 25 cm. Figure 5 shows a plot of all the points at which
an individual limpet was found during low tides over 2 weeks. A
circle with a radius of 19 cm encloses all the points.
Only 12 of 18 limpets returned to a specific site over 2 weeks.
Only 3 individuals were observed to return to a specific site more
than once, 1 returning 5 times, and 2 returning twice. The individual
that returned 5 times always returned to the same site with its
head in the same orientation, but orientations in other homers were
not always so precise. The same individual exhibited an activity
pattern, spending 3 consecutive high tides foraging, then 3 at
home. 3 cases were observed where a single site was occupied at
different times by 2 different limpets, not necessarily of the same
