LEGEND OF FIGURES
Figure 1. Vertical distribution of C. paradigitalis. Thin
vertical bar denotes range, wide hatched bar shows
standard deviation, black horizontal bar indicates
average density. Dashed lines represent Endocladia
level.
Orientations of substrate upon which limpets were found.
Figure 2.
Radial axes show the number of limpets.
Relative percent of limpets facing into vs. away from

waves over an exposure gradient. Diagram on right
shows direction of wave action upon substrate. Hatched
areas represent orientations of substrate which were
classified as either facing toward or away from waves.
Diagram of the homing range of a typical C. paradigitalis.
Figure 4.
Points indicate positions where the limpet was found
during low tides over 2 weeks. Radial axes in cm.
Orientations correspond to a 12 hour clock. Dashed
circle represents homing range with radius of 19 cm.

the average). Point with hatched circle believed to be
an error.
