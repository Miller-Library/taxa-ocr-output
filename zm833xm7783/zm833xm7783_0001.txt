INTRODUCTION
Collisella paradigitalis (Fritchman, 1960) is a common limpet
of the mid to hugh rocky intertidal occuring along the Bacific
coast from Southwestern Alaska to Northern Baja California. Previously
confused with a South American species, C. strigatella, it is now
recognized as a separate species (Lindberg, 1981). In contrast
to many other species of intertidal Acmaeids, little work has been
done on the biological aspects of this species.
The purpose of this study is to characterize the habitat niche
and activity patterns of C. paradigitalis. To define its habitat
niche, the following aspects were examined: 1) vertical distribution
2) wave exposure 3) orientation of substrate with respect to the
sun 4) orientation with respect to direction of wave action 5) slope
of substrate 6) presence in crevices.
To determine activity patterns, the following questions were
posed: 1) how far do they move? 2) what percent moves per high
tide? 3) is there a home range or restricted area over which these
limpets graze? 4) is there correlation between the size of an animal
and the distance it travels? 5) is there any evidence of homing?
Many of these questions have been studied in other limpet species,
but almost none have been adequately addressed for C. paradigitalis.
