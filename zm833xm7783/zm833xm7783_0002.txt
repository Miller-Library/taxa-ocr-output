DISTRIBUTION
METHODS
All distribution data were collected during morning low tides
during April and May of 1982. All study areas were located on
shoreline behind Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California,
The limpets had a patchy distribution in the study area, and
to maximize data collection, sites were selected which had sig-
nificant populations of C. paradigitalis. These were distributed
along a gradient of wave exposure classified by the average wave
size washing each area. An exposure scale of 4 levels was devised.
and study sites were assigned to these, as follows;
1) Very protected - waves gently lapping on shore. Outer
rocks and islands of rocks blocking main force of waves.
Little or no spray.
2) Moderately protected - waves causing some splash or spray,
Outer rocks blocking most of the waves.
3) Moderately exposed - waves causing quite a lot of splash
with spray. Outer rocks partly blocking waves.
4) Very exposed - waves violently crashing on rocks with much
spray. No outer rocks, waves come in full force.
For each level of exposure, approximately equal areas were surveyed
for limpets.
Intertidal height was determined by surveying points from a
benchmark of known elevation, and then recording the relative heights
for each limpet. In the very exposed study area, there were no
