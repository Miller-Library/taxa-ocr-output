show the least amount of error in the estimation of the slope, giving the most accurate
prediction of a common polarization value. The one-tailed t-test showed a significant
difference between the two estimated polarization values (p-0.014), but the conservative
ANOVA gave p-0.07, marginally insignificant.
Variation in membrane order between the exposed and protected sites, though
apparent and consistent in graphical representation, can be considered at best marginally
significant, with only four individuals from each site for replication, and only the least
conservative statistical test giving significant results. However, the subtle implication of
one significant result suggests the possibility that organisms inhabiting more protected
geographical regions of Cabrillo Point may have adjusted the composition of their tissue
membranes to compensate for the often extreme changes in thermal stress. The
polarization values imply that at a given temperature within the tested range, protected-
site L. keenae may have more stable membranes than do L. keenae at the exposed-site.
A comparison between the estimated polarization values for the two groups at
their respective average Th values (14°C and 24°C) reveals a striking similarity. The
predicted value for the exposed site is 0.276, and 0.270 for the protected site, suggesting
conservation of a specific, target membrane state even between differing thermal
microhabitats.
In context of previous interspecific vertebrate studies, the snails' conservation of a
fluorescence polarization value of 0.27 at average Tp is much higher than other conserved
fluidity ranges observed in vertebrates. In a 1993 study by Behan-Martin et al.,
membrane fluidities for several vertebrate species were compared by plotting the
temperature at which they displayed a polarization value of 0.22 against their accustomed
