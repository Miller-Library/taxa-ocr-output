Although the comparison between morning and afternoon collections at the
exposed site yielded no significant variation, membrane fluidities between exposed and
protected snails were different. Fluorescence polarization values for samples from the
exposed site following a midday tide (average Tp =16°C) were lower than those collected
from the protected site at the same time on the same day (average Tp -25°C). (Fig.3). The
effect of temperature on fluidity was not significantly different between sites (ANOVA).
However, the membrane fluidities of protected and exposed snails were statistically
different across the temperature range: using 20°C as a point of comparison, estimated
fluorescence polarization values for that temperature were compared using two statistical
methods. The one-tailed t-test showed a significant difference between the exposed site
and protected site fluidity measurements, p-0.014, while the more conservative ANOVA
gave a barely non-significant p of 0.075.
Discussion
Littorina keenae living in the intertidal microhabitats of Cabrillo Point on
California’s Central Coast regularly experience changes in ambient temperature as large
as 20°C in a six hour period. I recorded body temperature fluctuations spanning a range
of 10°C for L. keenae inhabiting the exposed site, while L. keenae at the protected site
experienced a range of 20°C for the same time period. This pattern makes intuitive sense,
as the exposed site is more consistently vulnerable to heat loss through wind convection
and to seawater spray, even during hot low tides. Conversely, organisms inhabiting the
protected site are sheltered from both wind and swell. On hot days, these animals would
be unable to cool themselves, either convectively to wind or conductively to water.
