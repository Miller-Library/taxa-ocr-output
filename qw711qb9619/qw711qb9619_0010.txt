During high tides, both sites are subject to seawater spray, so one might expect both sites
to experience similar minimal body temperatures. The Tp values recorded over the course
of this study precisely mirror this expectation. The recorded Tp values for the exposed
site ranged from 10°C at high tide to 19°C at low tide; the Tp values for the protected site
varied between 11°C and 32°
For the exposed and protected samples that were collected following a midday
low tide period, one might expect the protected site collection to have had a warmer
thermal history than the exposed site collection, and indeed the average body
temperatures for individuals in that collection from the protected site were 25°C, while
the average Tp for exposed site individuals was nine degrees cooler at 16°0. Thus I
predicted that the protected snails, with a relatively warm thermal history, would
compensate for the heat-induced increase in membrane fluidity by stabilizing its tissue
membranes.
The membrane fluidities of the exposed site collections taken at different times of
day reflect the relatively narrow range of thermal fluctuation observed at the exposed site.
Although inclusion of all of the afternoon exposed site samples in statistical comparisons
returned significant differences between morning and afternoon exposed-site collections,
when the two afternoon samples displaying lower polarization values were removed, the
differences disappeared. The rationale for the removal of these data follows.
In evaluating the slopes of each individual tested over the course of the study,
every tissue preparation demonstrated a decrease in fluorescence polarization as
temperature increased. The low polarization values for the two individuals in the
afternoon collection group not only were inconsistent in their raw polarization values, but
