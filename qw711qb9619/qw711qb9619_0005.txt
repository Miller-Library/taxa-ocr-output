Field Collection
Two variables were considered for this experiment: time and location. To test for
differences in membrane fluidity within one site at different times of day, specimens were
collected from the exposed site just before sunrise following a high tide, and again from
the exposed site in the mid-afternoon immediately following a midday low tide. To test
for variation between the exposed site and the protected site, samples from each location
were collected at the same time of day: mid-afternoon, following a midday low tide.
For both comparisons, specimens were collected from the field using forceps to
minimize thermal conduction that might affect body temperature measurements. Body
temperatures were obtained by inserting a type-K thermocouple probe into the foot tissue
of the organism, and the specimens were then flash-frozen and kept on solid CO2 until
returned to the lab where they were stored at -80°C.
Tissue preparation
Each specimen was dissected in iced seawater for the extraction of gill and mantle
tissues. Following dissection, the sample tissues were stored at -80°C until tested. Frozen
tissue from each snail was homogenized in 3.5mL of 50mM phosphate buffer, using a
ground glass homogenizer. All procedures were performed on ice. I then divided the
homogenized tissue suspension between two 2mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged both
at 80g (1000 RPM) for three minutes at 4°C. The supernatant from both tubes was
transferred to a 3mL cuvette, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of
364nm. The supernatant was diluted to A364-0.15 and placed in a plastic fluorescence
