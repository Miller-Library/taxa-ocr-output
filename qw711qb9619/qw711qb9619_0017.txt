Fig. 1. Fluorescence polarization (inversely proportional to membrane fluidity) of DPH in
lipid membranes of gill and mantle tissue extracted from two groups of L. keenae
individuals from the exposed site, one group collected before sunrise following an early-
morning tide (closed triangles, N=4), the other collected in the afternoon following a
midday low tide (open circles, N=4). Single factor analysis of variance shows a
significant difference between the two slopes (morning collection, y--0.0022x+0.3166,
=0.9973; afternoon collection, y—-0.001 1x+0.2569, R=-0.8655), p-0.02. Data points
depict individual samples.
Fig. 2. Fluorescence polarization of DPH in lipid membranes of gill and mantle tissue of
two groups of L. keenae individuals collected from the exposed site: one group collected
prior to sunrise following an early-morning high tide (closed triangles, N-4), and the
other collected in the afternoon following a midday low tide (open circles, N-2).
Samples here are the same as those illustrated in Fig. 3, minus the two samples showing
low polarization values. A single-variable analysis of variance shows no significant
difference between the slopes for the two groups (morning collection, y-
0.0022x+0.3166, R==0.9973; afternoon collection, y—-0.0017x+0.3053, R°=0.9405),
p-0.92. Data points depict means + 1 S.D.

fluidity) in lipid membranes of gill and mantle tissue excised from Littorina keenae
