body temperature. The resulting line is exceptionally conserved. (Fig. 4). The equivalent
value for L. keenae was included as an *X" and is clearly divergent from the data of
Behan-Martin (1993). (Fig. 4). The disparity between membrane fluidity conservation in
L.keenae and fluidity conservation among the vertebrate data might be due to several
factors, the most parsimonious of which would be to assume error in my own data
collection. The illustrated vertebrate polarization values were obtained using purified
lipid vesicles, while my data were obtained using crude homegenates of both gill and
mantle tissues. The inconsistency could also be a result of phylogenetic differences
between vertebrates and invertebrates, though more data concerning invertebrate
membrane fluidities would be required to make that distinction.
Nevertheless, membrane fluidities of L. keenae are not as divergent from other
published data as suggested by the above analysis. Inclusion of my data on a plot of
previously published polarization values as a function of temperature (Logue, et al.,
2000) indicates that L. keenae seems to be conserving its membranes in a more ordered
state than the given vertebrates. (Fig.5). The range for L. keenaeâ€™s polarization values is
comparable to the illustrated endothermic vertebrates, suggesting that L. keenae is
acclimatized to higher body temperatures. However, the slopes for the snail polarization
values are less steep than the most similar vertebrate slopes. One explanation might be
that L. keenae is routinely exposed to the upper thermal range included in this figure and
would be adjusting membrane fluidity to these warm temperatures. Both the similarity of
L. keenae to warm-adapted animals and the presence of a more gradual slope in the snail
data suggest the possibility that keenae is compensating toward its upper thermal limits.
