with extreme heat would need to stabilize their membranes, restructuring lipid
composition to a higher proportion of saturated molecules; whereas an organism
challenged by extremely cold conditions would want to increase the fluidity (lipid
desaturation) of its membranes to counteract the stabilizing effect of the low
temperatures. This adaptive conservation of a biologically optimal range for membrane
fluidity is referred to as homeoviscous adaptation (Sinensky, 1974).
Many studies have investigated the existence and extent of homeoviscous
adaptation through comparisons among poikilothermic microorganisms and across
vertebrate taxa (Sinensky, 1974; Cossins et all, 1984; Behan-Martin et al., 1993; Logue et
al., 2000). Nevertheless, few studies have explored structural compensation in
membranes for thermal stress among invertebrate species (Dahlhoff and Somero, 1993;
Williams and Somero, 1996). Most of the studied vertebrate organisms tend to live in
environments of relative thermal stability. However, for invertebrate poikilotherms
inhabiting marine intertidal habitats, extreme temperature fluctuations can occur on a
daily basis during low tide periods, and these organisms face an intriguing homeostatic
challenge. One study of membrane fluidity in intertidal mussels illustrated seasonal
acclimatization in gill phospholipid structure associated with wide ranges in body
temperature, and alteration of membrane order was also observed during a laboratory
simulation of a hot low tide (Williams and Somero, 1996).
An investigation of membrane fluidity in animals sampled directly from intertidal
microhabitats following high and low tide periods would provide further insight into the
energetic compromises that organisms must make in the face of environmental stressors.
