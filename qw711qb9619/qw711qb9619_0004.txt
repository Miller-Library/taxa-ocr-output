organisms facing myriad physiological challenges in the field, I studied membrane
fluidities in the intertidal snail L. keenae, an invertebrate abundant in the marine intertidal
of the Central Coast of California.
The microhabitats of L. keenae examined in this study expose the animals to a
range of convective heat loss from wind and wave forces, and render them vulnerable to
varying degrees of solar heat radiation, intensified by reflected heat emanating from the
granite boulders inhabited by the snails. Being small poikilotherms, L. keenae are at the
mercy of their thermal environments.
In this study, I examined the membrane fluidity of L. keenae occupying two
specific microhabitats on Cabrillo Point at Hopkins Marine Station on Californiaâ€™s
Central Coast: a protected site and an exposed site. Because of its geographic orientation,
the protected site is sheltered from wind and swell, but faces the sun; whereas the
exposed site is frequently susceptible to wind, spray, and waves. At both sites, L. keenae
are situated in the upper regions of the intertidal zone, about three to four feet above the
mean low water level, and are not regularly submerged (pers. obs.). Both sites are subject
to seawater spray during high tide, and both are air-exposed during low tide (pers. obs.).
Environmental variations between the two sites suggest a possibility for two different
levels of thermal acclimatization, while thermal variations correlated with tidal rhythms
provide a second point of comparison. I hypothesized that snails situated on the exposed
site or snails recently exposed to high tide seawater spray, might have higher membrane
fluidities over a range of temperatures than would snails from the protected site following
air and heat exposure during a warm low tide period.
