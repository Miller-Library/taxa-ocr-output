Abstract
Many poikilotherms exhibit adaptive changes in cellular membrane fluidity
(homeoviscous adaptation) to counter potentially disruptive effects of thermal variation in
their environments. The process of homeoviscous adaptation was studied in an intertidal
snail, Littorina keenae, which encounters wide variation in body temperature due to
differences in microhabitat conditions and the effects of tidal rhythms. This study
investigated the effects of thermal variation arising from microhabitat differences
between two geographic sites and from tidal cycle effects within a single site on
membrane fluidity. L. keenae, a species widespread along the North American Pacific
Coast, was studied at two sites on Cabrillo Point at Hopkins Marine Station in Central
California, one site being wind and wave exposed (exposed site), the other relatively
protected by its cove-like orientation (protected site). Protected site individuals exhibited
body temperature fluctuations as great as 20째C within a six-hour period (10 to 30째C).
whereas the exposed population exhibited only a 10째C range in the most extreme case
(10 to 20째C). Fluidities of membranes of gill and mantle tissue were quantified by
measuring fluorescence anisotropy using the membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-
hexatriene (DPH). Samples from the exposed site population collected prior to and
following midday low tide exhibited no differences in membrane viscosity. However, in
one instance exposed individuals collected at the same time showed two distinct levels of
membrane fluidity, suggesting disparate thermal histories. In addition, comparisons with
previously published data on membrane fluidity for other species may indicate that L.
keenae is compensating toward its upper thermal range.
