Body temperatures for L. keenae fluctuated with tide and time of day at both sites,
but organisms at the protected site were found to experience more extreme fluctuations
than those at the exposed site. Body temperatures (Tp) recorded at the exposed site ranged
from 9°C to 19°C within a six-hour period; whereas measurements at the protected site
exhibited a wider fluctuation, from 10°C to 32°C.
Fluorescence polarization values for every sample fell between 0.22 and 0.31
across the tested temperature range. As the temperature increased, polarization values
declined (enhanced membrane fluidity).
Exposed site samples collected in the morning and afternoon showed similar
membrane fluidities. Specimens collected before sunrise from the exposed site following
high tide had a mean Tp of 13°C, and membrane fluidities were similar for all snails
collected. The second group of exposed specimens collected in the afternoon following a
midday low tide had a mean Tp of 18°C and resulted in two pairs of differing membrane
fluidities. One pair closely matched the fluidities of the morning collection, while the
other pair displayed lower polarization values across the temperature range. (Fig. 1). The
effect of temperature on fluidity was significantly different between the morning and
afternoon samples (ANÖVA, p-0.02), but this difference disappeared when I excluded
the two individuals having considerably lower polarization values (ANÖVA, p-0.07).
(Fig. 2). Estimated fluorescence polarization values at 20°C (disregarding the two
individuals having low polarization values) of morning and afternoon samples were not
significantly different (ANOVA, p-0.92).
