Conclusions
L. keenae inhabiting the marine intertidal environment at Cabrillo Point
experience rapid and dramatic fluctuations in ambient and body temperatures. Snails in
the microhabitat of the protected site see warmer, more extensive fluctuations than do the
exposed site snails. Samples collected from the exposed site in the morning and later that
afternoon showed no significant differences in the membrane states between the two
groups. Conversely, the comparison between exposed and protected sites following a
midday low tide revealed slightly significant differences that may imply acclimatory
alterations in membrane compostion. At the very least, this subtle dissimilarity demands
closer inspection.
