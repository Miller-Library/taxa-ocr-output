thermocouple immediately prior to each trial. This procedure was repeated at each of the
following temperatures: 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, and 35°C.
Values given for the emission of polarized light at each filter angle were recorded
and used to determine the fluorescence polarization of the sample for that trial (Litman
and Barenholz, 1982). Fluorescence polarization values (P) - which are inversely
proportional to membrane fluidity - were calculated using the following equation (Litman
and Barenholz, 1982):
190,0
(0,0)-
10,90
0,90
P-
10,0
(0,0)
10,90
(J0,90
The polarization value was calculated for each replicate and averaged to obtain the
fluorescence polarization value for the sample.
Statistics
Regression lines from the relationship of fluorescence polarization and
temperature were generated for each sample. The slopes of these regression lines were
used for statistical comparisons (i.e., exposed site versus protected site, and exposed site
morning collection versus exposed site afternoon collection) using a single-factor
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA was also used to compare estimated
polarization values at common temperature (20°C) for the same comparisons. In the case
of the exposed vs. protected site comparison, a one-tailed student's t-test was also
applied. In all cases, a S 0.05.
