specimens collected from both the exposed site (open circles, N=4) and the protected site
(closed triangles, N=4) in the afternoon immediately following a midday low tide. A
single-factor analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the slopes
(exposed, y—-0.0021x+0.3057, R°-0.9923; protected, y--0.0023x+0.3256, R°-0.9589)
p=0.6. At 20°C, estimated polarization values show significant difference using a one-
tailed student's t-test, p-0.014. Data points depict means + 1 S.D.
Fig 4. Conservation of membrane fluidity across several vertebrate species (adapted from
Behan-Martin, et al., 1993). Temperature at which the animal shows a polarization of
0.22 is plotted against the animal’s accustomed body temperature. Snail value is the“
symbol.
Fig. 5. Fluorescence polarization (membrane fluidity) values shown as a function of
temperature for vertebrates adapted from Logue et al., 2000, including exposed site and
protected site data for L. keenae (from Fig. 1 for comparison) shown as patterned lines.
