the slopes for both individuals were also nearly zero (-0.0004 and -0.0007 fluorescence
polarization per °C, respectively), indicating the physically unlikely lack of change in
membrane fluidity with respect to temperature. This insensitivity to temperature led me
to suspect that the preparation of the sample was flawed. Therefore, I included two
graphical and statistical analyses for the same comparison, one including and one
excluding the inconsistent data. (Figs. 1 and 2). However, for the purposes of discussion,
1 will refer to the data that exclude the anomalous samples.
No significant differences in membrane fluidity could be seen between the
exposed group collected in the early morning following high tide and the exposed group
collected later that afternoon following low tide (ANÖVA, p-0.07). Based on the
assumption that any adjustments in membrane composition would occur in response to
differing thermal histories, a lack of alteration may indicate a lack of thermal disparity
between the two groups. The Tp values for the morning collection averaged 13°C and the
mean Ty for the collection was 18°C, so the average body temperature range remained
relatively narrow. Moderate changes in body temperature in such a short period may
present less of a cost to the organism than would an energy expenditure to restructure its
membranes during that time.
The disparity between the two thermal environments (exposed and protected) is
reflected in the membrane orders of organisms taken from each site. (Fig.3). Over a range
of temperatures, samples collected from the protected site exhibit higher membrane
stability than do those individuals from the exposed site. To quantify this difference, I
used both a single-factor ANÖVA and a student's t-test for the estimated polarization
values at 20°C. Because 20°C lies in the middle of the data set, using this x-value would
