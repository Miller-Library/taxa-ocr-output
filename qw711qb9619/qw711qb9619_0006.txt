cuvette, into which 2uL of 1.8mM DPH solution was added for a final DPH
concentration of 3.6nM in the cuvette (see below for DPH preparation). Cuvettes were
then sealed with a thin layer of parafilm to prevent dust or lint contamination, and stirred
for thirty minutes in the dark, allowing for the diffusion of the DPH molecule into
membranes.
DPH preparation
I dissolved 2.3 mg 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) crystals into 5 mL N'-N'-
dimethylformamide for a 1.8mM DPH concentration and covered the solution in foil to
prevent the photo-degradation of DPH. The solution was then placed on a stir bar to mix
for one hour prior to being introduced into the tissue preparation.
Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements
All cuvettes were then placed into a water bath at 10°C for approximately 15
minutes for thermal equilibration. I placed each cuvette into the water-jacketed cell of the
spectrofluorometer. Parameters for fluorescence polarization measurements were as
follows: excitation, slit width = 3 nm, A = 364.0 nm; emission, slit width = 10 nm, X -
430.0 nm; response time = 8 s; repetitions = 5; recording range = 0 to 1000. After
checking the temperature of the mixture within the cuvette (using a K-type
thermocouple), I took polarization measurements at the following polarized filter angles:
0°,0°; 90°,0°; 90°,90°; 0°,90°; for excitation, emission angles respectively. This series of
measurements composed one trial. For each sample, two trials were repeated at each
temperature, and the actual temperature within the cuvette was re-measured with the
