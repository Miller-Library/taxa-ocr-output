compared with the absorbtion spectrum of a similar sige
piece of Ulva.
The rock samples extracted were 5 cm by 5 cm square and from
to 10 mm deep, depending on the depth of the green color-
tion beneath the surface. Because this depth varied, all
calculations were based on surface area and not volume.
The rock samples were crushed with a mortar and pestle,
laced in dark screw cap bottles, and covered with 50 ml ab-
jolute methyl alcohol per 25 cm2 rock. Acetone and ethyl
alcohol were tried but did not affect complete extraction.
The bottles were then placed in a refrigerator for 29 hours,
ontents filtered through l filter paper, and immediately
analyzed on a Beckman Modal DUR spectrophotometer at wavelenghts
from 430 to 680 millimicrons.
Samples of Ulva were cut into 1 cm squares and extracted
ia similar manner without grinding. The absorbtion values

corrected to 25 cm2 Ulva/50 ml alcohol.

alls, spails were removed and their shells crushed and
extracted as above. The absorbtion spectrum was corrected
to 25 cm shell sufface/50 ml alcohol. The shell surface
estimations are described under Photosynthetic Rate.

Rock samples were removed intact from outcroppings and
a 25 cm surface area exposed, the rest of the rock covered
ith aluminum foil to prevent light from entering. The rocks
were placed in one liter jars filled with sea water of a known
