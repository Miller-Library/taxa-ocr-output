shells.4 Growth was also found in stomach contents of both
species. When the outer layers of eroded shells were dissolved
with HGl and the underlying material scraped off and examined,
the alga was very prevelent, especially the massive, spherical
thallus of overlapping, fused filaments. Since E. testarum
grew well from scrapings of a brown eroded shell with no visible
surface green, it may be the agent responsible for the shel.
erosion.

Prominent among the blue-greeny found were Plectonema
terebrans (Plate 1, fig. 3), Calothrix pilosa (Plate 2, fig. 4),
and Calothrix crustacea (Plate 2, fig. 5). These algae fit the

ffers from Umezaki's description, being found here in shells
of live L. planaxis and on the granite rocks in close ass-
ociation with the other blue-greens and with S. coalita pre-
viously mentioned.. It could also be responsible for some of
the erosion of shells, since it is a shell boring form. All
three of these blue-greens were found in cultured stomach
contents and P. terebrans was found in sea foam (probably
washed from rocks). C. pilosa was very abundant in the stomach
planaxis. Generally, the blue-greens did as well in
