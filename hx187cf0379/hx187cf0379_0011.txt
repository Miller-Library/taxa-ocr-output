Effects of Grazing
Methods
For this determination a flat surface was selected at the
tide level. Six baskets of 15 cm by 15 cm by 5 cm size
were fastened to the rock by bolts driven into the granite.
The area received abundant splash and spray during high tides
and was inhabited by littorines of both species, but prim-
arily L. planaxis.
Ten snails (L. planaxis) with a volume of .27 co/snail

were introduced into each of three of the baskets while
the other three baskets were kept empty.
After 25 days the baskets and snails were removed and
emf sections of granite were chipped from the center of
each basket-covered area. The rocks were analyzed as in
previous chlorophyll(a) determinations to ascertain any dif-
ferences in pigment content which could be used as a measure
of food consumed.

Results
The absorbtion spectra of the grazed and ungrazed surfaces oo

are presented in the graph on page 15. Chlorophyll a content
was not known before the test,so its calculation would not
be meaningful.
For a general measure, subtracting the absorption values for
grazed and ungrazed surfaces at the peaks gives a value of
from 66 to 104. Therefore, 10 snails with a volume of 2.7 cc
grazing on a 225 cme surface of granite reduce the pigment
content by about 8% when compared with an ungrazed surface
nterd durtes
over a period of 25 days.
