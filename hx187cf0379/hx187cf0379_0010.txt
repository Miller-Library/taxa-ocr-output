1.6 ga carbon/n/ day
Ulva previõusly determined for Hopkins Marine Station:
- 3 - 7.2 gs cärbon/m2/day
Shells (L. planaxis adv. of 4 samples):
- .981 gs carbon/m/day
Respiration Rate
Rock surface (adv. of 3 samples):
246.8 ml 02/m2/day
Final Determination of Standing Crop
ince the photosynthetic rate of the granite surface
turns out to be about half that of Ulva's minimum value,
and the chlorophyll (a)content of the granite surface is approx-
imately half that of an equal surface of Ulva, then it is
assumed that chlorophyll a content and standing crop are re-
lated and that the relation for Ulva is proportional to that
of the algae in the granite surfaces. If this assumption can
be made then dividing Ulva's Ca content into that of the rock:
.043 -r.081 - .53
Standing crop of Ulva for Hopkins Marine Station
- 70 gs carbon/m?
Then the standing crop of algae on the granite
surfaces
- (70) (.53) - 37 gs carbon/m2
Dividing standing crop by production rate we
get time for crop on rock
- 37441.66 = 22.3 days
chart summarizing the results of standing crop deter-
minations is presented on page 14.
