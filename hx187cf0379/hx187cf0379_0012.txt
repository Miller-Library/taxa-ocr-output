2. The standing crop of the microscopic algae on granite
surfaces is 37 gs carbon/m2 with a production rate of 1.66
carbon/m2/day. Production rate for the algae on the shells
L. planaxis is .981 gs carbon/m2/day. The pigment content
of the algae on the shells is much greater than that of a rock
or Ulva surface of similar size.
3. In 25 days, ten snails reduce the algal pigment content
of a 225 cm2 granite surface by approximately 8% when com-
pared with an ungrazed surface of similar size.
