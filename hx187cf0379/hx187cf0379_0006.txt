Dermocarpa sp. (Plate 2, fig. 6)8 and Ã¶piruliha sp.
(Plate 3, fig. 9)7, two other blue-greens, were found in lim-
ited quantities. The Spirulina was found in association with Pcko
P. terabrans on rock surfaces, and Dermocarpa was found grow-
ing on Rhodochorton Rothii filaments in the field only.
Roodochorton Rothii was the only red found, commonly in
crevices receiving very little sunlight. L. planaxis is often
observed in these crevices and some pieces of R. Rothii were
found in their stomach contents, although none grew in culture.
This species fits Smith's description except for its growing

Diatoms and unicellular greeng and blue-green, were found
most cultures but no attempt was made to identify them.
The diatoms were especially abundant both in rock cultures and
stomach contents, and seem to constitute one of the primary
food sourees of the littorines.
Determination of Standing Crop and Littorina Grazing Effects
Methods
Chlorophyll content
In an effort to determine the standing crop of all the
microscopic algae in the 6' to 8' range, areas of rock were
chipped from the surface with hammer and chisel. The chloro-
phyll and other pigments were extracted with methyl alcohol and
their absorbtion spectra determined. The rock spectras were
