The first growth in culture consisted of bacteria, but
fter ten days a conspicious growth of diatoms appeared,
specially from rock surface scrapings on medium 1. After 15

The alga giving the common green coloration to round
ocks in tide pools and to granite surfaces above tide pools
was identified as the chlorophyta, Spongomorpha coalita (see
