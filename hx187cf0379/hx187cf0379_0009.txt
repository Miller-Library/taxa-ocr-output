since chlorophyllta)is present in all the algae found, this
jas used as a standard of comparison.
Using Strickland and Parsons! method, chlorophyll ta) con-
nt was determined by the formula
Ca - 15.6 Eggg - 2.0 Eg4g - 0.8 Eg3o
- mg chlorophyll a)/ liter of solvent
(when absorbtion is measured in a lom
cell) and Ersees
Values obtained were corrected to one liter of methyl
alcohol and then to one meter squared of rock surface.

nis value is probably(gomewhat less than the exact(value
because of the presence of blue-green (pigments) abga
Ulva chlorophyll (a) content using the same formula:
Ulva (adv. of 3 samples) - .081 gs Ca / me
Shell ohlorophyll k)content was not calculated because
after 29 hours the shells were not completely extracted. It
is significant that even with incomplete extraction the shells
have a higher pigment content than either the Ulva or the rock.
