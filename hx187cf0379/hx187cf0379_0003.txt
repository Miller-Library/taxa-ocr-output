Medium 2 was identical with medium 1 except NH,NOg was
omitted and 10  molar NaMo0, added. This medium was used
to encourage the growth of possible nitrogen fixing blue-
green algae present.
In addition to the above mediums, two more were made,
one using medium 1 with a salt concentration in the sea water
four times normal (4X sea water), and another using medium 1
with L. planaxis mucus and feces spread over the surface.
Both were prepared to approximate more closly the natural
habitat of the algae.
Many snail shells, especially those of L. planaxis, have
very green color and are deeply eroded and pitted, and snails
are normally observed crawling on one another. It was thought
that the green may be a source of microscopic algal food,
and perhaps the cause of the erosion. Therefore, the outer
surface of a green shell and a brown eroded shell were scraped
and plated on medium 1.
Snails of both species were collected after high high water
le moving, dissected, and the stomach contents plated on
poth mediums 1 and 2 to culture any undigested pieces of algae.
Lastly, since the littorines Ã¥re splashed regularly during
igh tides, some sea foam was collected and plated to identif.
possible algal food sourees not livingidirectly in or on the
granite rocks.
The cultures were placed upside down in front of a north
window which had been covered with tissue paper to prevent
