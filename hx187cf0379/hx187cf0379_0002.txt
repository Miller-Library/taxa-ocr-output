Microscopic Algal Food of Littorina planaxis and
Littorina scutulata
Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata are commonly
observed inhabiting the granitic upper littoral and supra-
ittoral areas generally devoid of macroscopic algae. This
tudy was undertaken to determine what microscopic algal type
the animals were feeding on in these seemingly bare areas and
get an idea of the effects of this feeding on algal growth.
The study is conveniently divided into two parts: 1. Iden-
ification 2. Determination of standing crop of microscopic
lgae and the effect of littorines grazing upon it.
Identification
Methods
Rock specimens were removed from areas inhabited by the
littorines in the 6 to 8 foot range above mean zero tide.
Their surfaces, crevices, and cracks were scraped into ster-
ile sea water and then plated on an agar culture medium.
The mediums used were of two basic types. Medium 1 was
made up of 2% agar in sterile sea water plus 10-3molar Na,HPo
and 10 3molar NH,NOg. A soil extract was prepared by mixing
crushed granite with dark soil in 1 to l proportions; To this
mixture was added 2 parts sea water and the soil-granite and
vater were heated at 90Â°C for one hour. The mixture was then
filtered and the brownish liquid filtrate was added to the
culture medium, 1 part soil extract to 10 parts agar plus sea
