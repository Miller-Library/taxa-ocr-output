og concentration, and placed in the sun for 2 hour.
The
rocks were then removed and the water Ã¥nalyzed by the Winkler
method to determine Og increase. From this, carbon productior
s calculated.
Ulva's photosynthetig rate was previously determined (see
under Final Determination of Standing Crop).
The photosynthetic rate of snail shells (L. planaxis) was
determined by cracking the shells to remove the snails and
putting the shells in sea water in direct sunlight. 02 in-
crease was again measured by the Winkler method. Snail sur-
face area was calculated by approximating with 1/ of wr/r24 h2
the formula for the area of a right circular cone. R here is
the distance across the operculer opening and h the height of
the shell from the bottom of the operculer opening to the to
the spire.
Respiration Rate
Only the respiration rate for a 25 cm granite surface
measured. This was done by chipping a rock to the de-
sired dimensions and putting it in sea water in the dark for
12 hours. Op concentration before and after was measured
the Winkler method and Og decrease calculated.
Results

Chlorophyll Content
The absorption spectra of an adverage of three 25 cm2
ock surfaces, three l ome pieces of Ulva corrected to 25
eme, and four crushed shells with a surface area of 6 cme
corrected to 25 cm2 are presented in the graph on page 13.
