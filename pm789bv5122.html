remain immotile and do not feed for long periods of time, while lower pop-
ulations move and feed more frequently. Studies were carried out to deter-
mine whether any nutritional or metabolic adaptations enable these high pop-
ulations to sustain themselves over these prolonged periods between feeding.
Comparisons were made of glycogen conte and respiratory rate between two
populations; one at plus two feet in the intertidal, the other at plus six feet.
It was demonstrated that the higher populations have greater glycogen stores
and lower respiratory rates than the lower populations. The differences
could revresent an adaptation to survive for long periods between feeding.

TRODUC
ION
Of the several species of <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Acmaea : PartialExact'>Acmaea found</span> in the intertidal of Mon-
terey County, <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. scabra</span> (Gould 1846) occupies the highest zone on the
rocks (Hewatt 1935). It ranges between the tide levels of plus two
and plus six feet. Hewattihasyobserved, and my own observations have
confirmed, that these limpets make excursions in search of food only
when submerged or amidst heavy wave action. Lower populations move
more often, and more regularly, than do populations located at higher
tide levels. For example, individuals of the higher populations have
been observed to remain immotile for periods up to three days.
In April and May, 1966, studies were carried out at the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California, to
determine what physiological factors enable these populations to sustain
themselves over prolonged periods between feeding. Two parameters were
investigated; oxygen consumption and glycogen stores. These parameters
were chosen in conjunction with the hypothesis that a decrease in meta-
bolic activity and larger stores of glycogen may allow the animals to
survive under conditions that preclude frequent feeding.
MTTHODS
All specimens were collected off Mussel Point, Pacific Grove,
California. Individuals were taken from two different parts of the
intertidal; below plus two feet and above plus six feet. Within twen¬
ty minutes after collection, individual animals were placed in a sep¬
arate water-filled jar and their oxygen consumption measured for a three
hour period by the Winkler method (Welsh & Smith,1949, pg.146). The
water temperature remained constant at 11 C. In order to minimize

oxygen evolutionby algae on the shells, the shells were scraped and the
animals kept in the dark. After the respiratory measurement was comple-
ted, each animal was removed from its shell, blotted and weighed. These
same individuals were then used to determine the amount of glycogen
present in the entire body. The whole animal was homogenized in 2mls.
of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the glycogen was
precipitated from the trichloroacetic acid supernatant by the addition
of an equal volume of 95% ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in
Amls. of water and the carbohydrate content determined using the phe¬
nol-sulfuric acid method of Dubois (1956).

The results of measurements of oxygen consumption are represented
in Table 1 and glycogen content in shown in Table 2.
The findings show a difference in metabolic activity and glyco¬
gen stores in animals from the two intertidal locations. The results
show that the higher forms have higher glycogen stores and lower meta¬
bolic activity than the animals from the lower intertidal area. <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Thes : PartialExact'>Thes
combination</span> ofthscould be the critical factor permitting maintenance
of the animal between feedings. Measurements of glycogen in the higher
group also shows a somewhat greater range, as is reflected in the higher
standard deviation. A greater degree of variation in glycogen content
would be anticipated if life between feedings is dependent upon the use
of glycogen stores. The higher mean glycogen content in the limpets
from higher portions of the intertidal also suggests an increased
storage potential in these animals.
The glycogen and respiratory data also permit calculation of the

minimum time these higher populations could survive between feedings,
if glycogen were the sole respiratory substrate. Assuming six moles
of oxygen consumed per mole of glucose utilized, this could permit
submerged maintenance for sixty hours. The lower population of Acmaea
scabra, with its higher respiratory activity and lower glycogen store,
could only maintain itself for seventeen hours. Since Baldwin (1966)
has found that the aerial respiration rate in A. scabra is several times
less than the submerged rate, the above values are certainly minimal
for aerially-breathing limpets.
Lower metabolic activity and higher glycogen content are not the
only characteristics of high populations that suggest adaptations for
survival in the higher portions of the intertidal. Nawatt (1940) has
observed that the shells of Acmaea scabra from higher intertidal areas
are higher and thicker, while the shells of this species living in low,
moist areas are thinner and flattened. In addition, the study of Jessee
(1966) indicates that A. scabra of the higher intertidal shows a greater
tendency to home than <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. scabra found</span> in the low intertidal. Animals
with a strong homing tendency present a greater irregularity of shell
shape that is complementary to the home site. The resulting better fit
of animal to substratum may decrease susceptibility to desiccation.
A third adaptation of the higher forms, shown by the study of Hardin
(1966), demonstrates that higher populations of A. scabra can withstand
greater temperatures than populations lower in the intertidal.

SUMMARY
1. Metabolic activity and glycogen content of pop-
from the higher and lower por-
ulations of Acmaea scabr
tions of the intertidal wer
re determined.
2. Animals from plus six feet showed lower metabolic
activity and larger glycogen stores than animals from plus
two feet.
3. The possible survival value of this difference
is discussed.
