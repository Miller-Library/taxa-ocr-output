Introduction
Marine organisms that inhabit intertidal ecosystems must be capable of coping
with an extreme range of environments. Most notably, they must be able to withstand
exposure during low tide and the accompanying increase in temperature and desiccation
rates (Somero, 2002). Because marine organisms are primarily adapted to an aquatic
environment, the period spent exposed during low tide often requires dramatic responses
and alterations in behavior. These pressures have produced a wide range of behavioral
strategies in intertidal organisms. While some strategies are clearly different, such as
between crabs and mussels, many more involve subtle differences in use of habitat. Even
organisms with similar physiology have developed markedly different ways of surviving
in the intertidal.
This study examines the behavioral strategies of three intertidal whelks, Nucella
emarginata, Ocenebra circumtexta, and Acanthanucella punctulata. Nucella is found in
variable wave conditions from mid to high intertidal height and feed predominantly on
Mytilus mussels and Balanus barnacles. Acanthanucella is typically found high in the
intertidal in moderate wave conditions and feed on Balanus and Chthamalus barnacles as
well as Littorina snails. Ocenebra is found commonly in heavy surf in the mid to low
intertidal and feed predominantly on Chthamalus and Tetraclita barnacles. Despite these
differences, these three species frequently occupy the same habitat. By observing these
whelks when they are found together, this study was able to distinguish unique behavioral
strategies that each species use to survive in the intertidal.
