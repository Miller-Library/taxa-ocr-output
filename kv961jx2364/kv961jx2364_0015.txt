Figure 1: Percent feeding by whelk species, tide height, sun exposure. Percents are daily
average proportion of snails feeding at each tide in each sun exposure category.
Figure 2: Percent of Acanthanucella punctulata feeding versus time of day when high
tide (open circles) or low tide (closed triangles) occurred. Vertical lines
indicate time of sunrise and noon. High Tide: P «.001; r* =.92; Low Tide: P
-.001, r’=.80
Figure 3: Percent of feeding individuals of each species found on horizontal, vertical,
and undercut substrate at high and low tide. Error bars are + 1 standard
deviation. Chi-square = 142.64 (df = 4, PS.001)
Figure 4: Percent of feeding individuals of each species found on low, medium, and
high-density barnacle cover (all tide levels combined). Error bars are + 1
standard deviation. Chi-square = 27.88 (df = 4, Pk.001)
Figure 5: Percent of non-feeding individuals of each species found on horizontal, vertical
and undercut substrate at high and low tide. Error bars are + 1 standard
deviation. Chi-square = 152.20 (df = 4, PS.001)
Figure 6: Percent of non-feeding individuals of each species found in crevices vs. open
rock faces (all tide levels combined). Error bars are + 1 standard deviation.
Chi-square = 84.57 (df = 2, PS.001)
Figure 7: Percent of non-feeding individuals of each species found in protective cover
(red algal cover or at bases of anemones) vs. -bare open rock. Error bars are +
1 standard deviation. Chi-square = 105.91 (df = 2, PS.001)
Figure 8: Percent of Nucella emarginata feeding versus time of day when high tide
(open circles) or low tide (closed triangles) occurred. Vertical lines indicate
time of sunrise and noon. High Tide: P =.76, r’ =.02, Low Tide: P =.86, r
.004
Figure 9: Percent of Ocenebra circumtexta feeding versus time of day when high tide
(open circles) or low tide (closed triangles) occurred. Vertical lines indicate
time of sunrise and noon. High Tide: P = .35, r’ =.14, Low Tide: P =.03,r
