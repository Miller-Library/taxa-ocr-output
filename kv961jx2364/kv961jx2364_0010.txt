because nearly the entire population feeds when submerged. Ocenebra is also unique in
utilizing undercut habitat for feeding as well as protection.
Previous studies of Ocenebra found interindividual variation in preferred prey
species (Dusek, 1999). If the species composition of barnacle cover is significantly
influenced by substrate orientation or sun-exposure, this variation may produce different
foraging strategies within an Ocenebra population whose individuals specialize on
different barnacle species. For example, individuals that feed preferentially on barnacles
found on sun exposed habitat may adopt a strategy similar to Acanthanucella and move
with the tide. Conversely, Ocenebra that feed on barnacles found on undercuts or
protected habitat may feed continually.
Although this study did not analyze barnacle distribution by microhabitat within
the study site, there is some evidence for such a hypothesis. Ocenebra feed
predominantly on Tetraclita and Chthamalus barnacles. (Morris et al, 1980). Of the three
barnacle species, Tetraclita occurs lowest on the shore and may therefore grow best in
undercuts and similarly protected habitat at higher levels (Morris et al, 1980). If this is
the case, then Ocenebra may be drawn towards undercuts out of food preference as well
as for protection from physical stress. In contrast, Burrow (2003) found that Chthamalus
is the dominant barnacle on sun-exposed rocks. As a result of these dispersal patterns,
Ocenebra with different food preferences may be forced to adopt different behavioral
strategies. Direct tests of the effect of individual food preferences on foraging strategies
of Ocenebra would be of interest.
A few general assumptions may require further investigation. When looking for
marked whelks, I had to assume that the enamel paint would be sufficiently permanent
