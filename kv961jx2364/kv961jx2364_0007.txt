there was a greater percentage found in protective cover (i.e. red algal cover or at bases of
anemones) than on rock (Fig. 7).
Roughly half of observed Nucella were feeding at either low or high tide (Fig.1).
These feeding proportions did not change significantly as the high and low tides
progressed into the day (Fig. 8). Nucella did not feed in significantly different
proportions in sun-exposed or shaded habitat at either high or low tide. They fed
predominantly on vertical surfaces at both tides (Fig. 3) and were most often on medium
density barnacle cover, though this percentage was highly variable from day to day (Fig.
When not feeding, Nucella were found in roughly equal proportions on horizontal
and vertical substrate but did not make use of undercuts (Fig. 5). Nucella were much
more likely to be found in crevices than open rock faces when not feeding (Fig. 6) and
were rarely found nestled in protective cover (e.g. red algae or the bases of anemones).
Ocenebra fed in high proportions at both high and low tide (Fig. 1). The percent
feeding at high tide did not vary depending on the timing of that tide, but the percent
feeding at low tide decreased significantly as the low tide progressed into the day (Fig.
9). At high tide they fed in roughly equal proportions on sun-exposed and shaded habitat,
but at low tide percent feeding in the sun was significantly less (Table 1). Ocenebra fed
on undercut surfaces in approximately the same proportions as vertical at low tide and
slightly less at high tide (Fig.3). They made little use of horizontal substrate at either tide
(Fig.3). Ocenebra were characteristically found in higher proportions on high density
barnacle cover than low or medium density (Fig. 4).
