Materials and Methods
This study was carried out in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge in Pacific Grove,
California (36°37N, 121°54'W). The principal study site was a 6 by 9 meter region of
rocky intertidal shore inhabited by Nucella emarginata, Ocenebra circumtexta,
Acanthanucella punctulata and a small number of Acanthanucella spirata. The latter
species was not included in this study due to its low abundance. The other three species
are found in patchy abundance along the shores of the Refuge, but this site was ideal
because it 1) was a place where all three species were found together in abundance, and
2) was easily accessible during high and low tides. To augment the data from this site,
two isolated granite boulders with abundant Acanthanucella, one within 10m of the
primary site and the other approximately 100 meters away, were also examined. All three
of these sites had healthy stocks of Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula which are the
principal prey for all three whelk species. The primary site also had a substantial
population of Tetraclita rubescens and a limited population of the mussel Mytilus
californianus.
Initially, all the individual whelks within a subsection of the primary site were
marked with enamel paint and observed at the daily low tide for 2 weeks. Twenty four
Nucella, 19 Acanthanucella, and 21 Ocenebra were individually marked. In addition, two
aggregations of 25 Acanthanucella were marked as groups, as was one Nucella
aggregation of 8. During each observational period I noted the location of each marked
whelk found within the study site.
I also performed site-wide surveys of feeding activity and microhabitat
conditions at the primary site and the two secondary sites. I conducted these surveys for
