for the duration of my study. I also took it for granted that applying the paint did not alter
the whelks' behavior. However, as many marked whelks were not recovered and both
Acanthanucella aggregations dispersed soon after being marked, these assumption may
be unwarranted. In addition, I assumed that the behavior of each species was not
dramatically influenced by the presence of the others. Although Acanthanucella have
been known to occasionally prey on Nucella, this was never observed in my site (Morris
et al, 1980).
Previous studies have found that behavioral patterns of individual species vary
depending on site conditions, local topography, and community structure. (Burrows and
Hughes, 1989; Dahlhoff et al, 2001; Fairweather, 1988). An obvious extension of this
comparative survey would be to examine behavior of these three whelks when they are
found together in different habitat.
In conclusion, this study has shown that Nucella emarginata, Ocenebra
circumtexta, and Acanthanucella punctulata exhibit different resource utilization
strategies when occupying the same habitat. Further information is needed from
additional sites to determine if these patterns are general or if they vary in space and time.
Regardless, my results suggest that further investigations to identify the ecological,
behavioral, and physiological selection pressures that produce divergence among such
ecologically similar, closely related sympatric species would be fruitful.
