the mating season. The influence of mating season on aggregation behavior warrants
further investigation.
Nucella display more conservative behavior. When they do move, which is less
often than the other species, they rarely leave barnacle cover or face prolonged sun
exposure. In addition, they feed the least at high tide and show no significance response
to changes in the daily timing of the tides. When not feeding they typically seek
protection in crevices, which may decrease stress due to emersion. A few Nucella were
observed laying eggs, which supports the conclusion from the literature that they mate
sporadically throughout the year (Morris et al, 1980). However, because this was limited
to a few individual whelks, it is unlikely that mating had a large influence on the
observed behavior of the entire population.
The activity of Nucella varied dramatically within the population. This
observation is supported by a previous survey of 128 Nucella emarginata (West, 1986).
During a four month period of low tide observations, 19% of the marked individuals
where not observed to feed while 40% made five or more sequential feeding attacks. This
raises the question of whether individuals display uniformly different foraging behavior
or cycle between periods of high and low activity. This question could be addressed by
detailed long-term observation of individual whelks throughout the tide cycle.
Ocenebra is unique in feeding heavily in both sun-exposed and shaded habitat,
though they feed significantly less in the sun at low tide. Like Acanthanucella, the
proportion feeding at low tide varies significantly depending on the time of day.
Ocenebra do not, however, show any variation with the timing of the high tide, likely
