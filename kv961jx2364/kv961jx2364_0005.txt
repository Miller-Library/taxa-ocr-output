The individually marked Acanthanucella were similarly mobile. Äfter two weeks,
only 3 of the 19 (16%) were found on the rock were they were tagged initially. Those that
had moved often had to travel through extensive barnacle-free rubble to reach their new
location. On average, 33% of all marked individuals were found during daily observation.
Acanthanucella frequently foraged in groups, typically of 4 to 10 individuals that
emerged from shelter and traveled together into sun-exposed barnacle-covered areas.
Ocenebra, like Acanthanucella, was highly mobile with an average recovery of
only 23%. Äfter two weeks, only 2 of the original 21 (10%) were found on the same rock.
These whelks were never found in aggregations, though they often occurred in pairs in
what was possibly mating behavior. Ocenebra also traveled through rubble to reach new
rocks.
Nucella was less mobile than either Ocenebra or Acanthanucella. On average,
50% of all marked individuals were found each day and, unlike the other species, they
were likely to be found on the same rock on successive days. Ten of the 24 (42%)
remained on the same rock for the entire two weeks. Those that did travel remained on
near-continuous barnacle cover. There was some aggregation behavior in Nucella but it
was not as obvious or consistent as Acanthanucella. Several Nucella laid eggs, but these
individuals were always solitary or with no more than 4 other conspecifics. Of the 8
individuals marked as a group, 6 dispersed individually and 2 remained at the original
location. It was common for individual whelks to forage continuously for days or to
remain in a barnacle-free crevice for weeks.
The study site and the surrounding area were examined for marked snails after 1
month. Of the 24 Nucella originally marked, 11 were found within the site, 6 of which
