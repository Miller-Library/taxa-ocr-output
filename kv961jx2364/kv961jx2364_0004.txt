two weeks at daily low low and high low. The microhabitat data were categorized
according to the following factors: rock orientation (vertical, horizontal, overhang),
presence of protective cover (red algal growth or sea anemones versus bare rock), crevice
or open rock face, barnacle cover (none, sparse, medium, dense), and whether the
location was sun-exposed or shaded.
The results of microhabitat usage were statistically analyzed using chi-square tests
of goodness-of-fit, which compared the observed frequencies against the null hypothesis
that all species utilize each habitat category in the same proportion. A 3-factor analysis of
variance (ANÃ–VA) was used to compare feeding data, with species, tide height, and sun
exposure as orthogonal fixed factors. Subsequent post-hoc comparisons were conducted
using Student-Newman-Kuels tests (Underwood, 1997). The feeding frequency at high or
low tide was compared against time of day using simple linear regression.
Results
Daily Observation of Marked Individuals
Acanthanucella was the most active species. The two non-mating aggregates,
which had been relatively stable for at least 2 days before marking, quickly disbanded.
One aggregate fell to 7 Acanthanucella after one day and 1 after two, while the other
dropped to 9 then 3 in the same time. These marked individuals were observed in the area
for a few days but many were not seen again. Neither of these areas, which were
barnacle-free undercuts, was ever repopulated. An unmarked mating aggregate within the
study site remained relatively stable at approximately 20 individuals.
