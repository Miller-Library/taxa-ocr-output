had not moved in two weeks. Four individually marked Acanthanucella were found
within the site though all had moved to new rocks. One of the aggregations had relatively
high returns: 4 of the 25 were found in a mating aggregation and 5 were moving as part
of a foraging group. Only a single individual was found from the other aggregation. Two
of the 21 marked Ocenebra were observed after a month and only one was inside the
study site.
Feeding and Microhabitat
Relatively low proportions of Acanthanucella fed during low tide, but the percent
feeding increased dramatically at high tide (Fig.1). These proportions varied significantly
depending on the time of day when low tide or high tide occurred: there was a significant
increase in the percent feeding at high tide as the tide progressed from sunrise to noon
and a significant decrease in the percent feeding at low tide in the same progression (Fig.
2). The proportion feeding in shaded habitat remained low at high and low tides, but the
proportion feeding in sun-exposed habitat increased significantly between low and high
tide (Fig. 1, Table 1). When Acanthanucella are feeding at low tide, they were
predominantly found on vertical surfaces, with a low percentage feeding on horizontal or
undercut substrate (Fig. 3). At high tide, they fed in nearly equal proportions on vertical
and horizontal surfaces and few were found feeding on undercuts (Fig. 3). They fed in
similar proportions on low and medium density barnacle cover and slightly higher
proportions on high density barnacle cover (Fig. 4).
When not feeding, Acanthanucella were found in similar abundance on horizontal
and undercut substrate and slightly less on vertical (Fig. 5). In these three orientations
they were found in equal proportions in crevices and on rock faces (Fig. 6). However,
