Abstract
This study examined behavioral patterns of three intertidal whelks in response to
tidal variation. Nucella emarginata, Ocenebra circumtexta, Acanthanucella punctulata
have widely overlapping habitat but significantly different resource utilization strategies.
All three species were found in the primary study site, a 6m by 9m region of rocky
intertidal shore with a vertical range of 0 to +2.5m above MLLW. Individuals were
marked and observed at low tide for a two week period to discern basic patterns of
movement and aggregation. Following this, surveys of microhabitat and activity were
taken of the same area at daily high and low low tides for another two weeks.
Acanthanucella were highly responsive to tidal patterns with 76% feeding at high tide
and only 27% feeding at low. They also fed significantly more on sun-exposed patches of
barnacles, often horizontal surfaces, during high tide (66% feeding in sun) than during
low tide (21% feeding in sun). Ocenebra show a slight but significant tendency to feed
less in the sun at low tide (27%) than at high tide (46%). However, the frequency of
feeding in shaded areas does not vary significantly with the tide, possibly because these
whelks are unique in utilizing undercut habitat. Nucella appear to have the most
conservative behavior, feeding the least at high tide (61%) and showing non-significant
responses to sun exposure and the timing of the low tide.
