Ocenebra were found predominantly on vertical surfaces when not feeding, but
the proportion found on each orientation was highly variable from day to day (Fig. 5).
Their use of crevices and protective cover was also highly variable and showed no clear
trends (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).
Discussion
Acanthanucella are highly mobile predators and very responsive to changes in
water level. As the tide rises, these whelks move into horizontal and sun-exposed habitat.
As the tide recedes and these areas become increasingly stressful, they move back into
protective cover (Morris et al, 1980). Acanthanucella also show dramatic variation in
feeding frequency depending on the timing of the tide. Similar behavior can also be
found in an Australian whelk, Thias orbita (Fairweather, 1988). In addition to this
pattern of local movement, Acanthanucella show high dispersal rates and may travel
across extensive rubble to reach new food sources. When foraging in this manner, they
tend to travel in groups. Acanthanucella are also commonly found in aggregations when
not foraging.
The extent to which Acanthanucella form aggregates and travel in groups may
depend on the time of year. This study was done during the peak of the Acanthanucella
mating season (May-June) and they are known to mate in tight aggregations (Morris et al,
1980). One such aggregation was observed in the primary study site. However, other
aggregations were loose and quickly dispersed. In addition, many foraging
Acanthanucella traveled in groups without apparent mating activity. This likely indicates
that coordinated behavior is characteristic of Acanthanucella and not entirely limited to
