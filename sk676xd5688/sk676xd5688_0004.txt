To measure the amounts of 1700, given off by the animal,
a 50ml. Erlenmeyer flask stoppered with Top stoppers, K-882310,
fitted with plastic center wells, K-882320, both from Kontes

system was allowed to stand for 24 hours before removal of the
wick for counting.
Gaseous 100, released by the animal during incubation
was trapped and measured in a similar way. Samples were counted
using a Nuclear-Chicago Unilux II scintillation counter.
