Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
were fed squid three times a week. At the end of this period,
all ten were put in 10ml. of 170-labeled gylsine, and uptake
and CO, release were measured as before.
The results are shown in Table #5. The difference in results
was assessed significant. In both cases the starved animals
removed amino acids and catabolized them at a significantly
higher rate, p(.05, p(.Ol respectively.
DISCUSSION
The results of the experiments performed indicate that
Metridium senile is capable of absorbing amino acids and glucose
from sea water at natural concentrations. The rates of uptake
are similar to those found by Schlichter an Anemonia sculcata
(Schlichter, 1974). The figures show that uptake is linear for
the first two hours, followed by a leveling off to a final
concentration. One possible explanation for the results is that
a minimum concentration was reached, below which the animal
could no longer absorb the amino acids. These minimal values
range from 1.2 x 10"' moles/liter for valine to 6.9 x 10 moles/li
