Uptake in Amino Acids by Metridium senile
to the animal. These anemones were used to measure uptake,
and release of amino acids, and the contribution of such
materials to C02 production by fed and starved animals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Metridium senile were maintained in the laboratory in
running water. They were fed squid every three days prior
to use. Animals weighing approximately 2 grams were placed
in a 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml. of filtered sea
water and allowed to settle 24 hours prior to the start of
an experiment. Filtered instant ocean containing 170-labeled
amino acids or glucose at concentrations found in coastal waters
were used, i.e. 60/m/1 for amino acids (Clark, Jackson, North,
1972) and 804g/1 for glucose (Riley, Chau, 1970). These
preparations were maintained at 11 to 12 C. The decrease in
dissolved organic material was measured by removing iml. samples
from the flask after thorough mixing by transfer to a scintillation
vial. 1002 was removed by the addition of IN HÂ»SO4. One hour
was allowed for the loss of volatile 0 before restoring the
