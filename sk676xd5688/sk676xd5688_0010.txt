Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
by active transport, as found by Schlichter (1974).
The increased utilization of dissolved amino acids by
starved Metridium was demonstrated, showing the possible selective
advantage to uptake of dissolved organics during food deprivation.
A similar increase in 00, production by starved Aurelia aurita
was shown by Shick (1975), who reached the same conclusion.
One possible explanation for this result would be a difference
in the freedamino acid pools of fed and starved animals. However,
in the same experiment, Shick (1975) showed that the total
free amino acid poncentration in the pools is little affected
by starvation, supporting the theory that increased uptake is a
response to starvation.
The possible importance of dissolved organics to Metridium
senile has been demonstrated by this study. However, no conclusive
statement as to their quantitative contribution to the animals
nutrition can be made until the 100,/1200, ratio for an
animal over a long period of time has been measured. Further
studies of this aspect are anticipated.
