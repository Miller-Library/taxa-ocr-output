Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
260 mCi/m mole; glutamic acid.1 mCi/27mg; glysine, .imCi/7.2 mg;
and New England Nuclears Amino Acid -70 (u.1.) Mixture, which
contains amino acids present in the same relative proportions
as found in a typical algal protein hydrolysate..Each ofthese
materials was tested for rates of uptake on two separate animals.
At the end of 12 hours exposure to the 70-labeled materials, the
animal was dried, weighed, and ground in a mortar before extraction
with 5 ml. of 70% ethanol for 24 hours to obtain free amino acids
and other extractable substances. An additional 5 ml. of ethanol
was added and the mixture centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m.'s. A
sample of both the supernatent and insoluble residue wascounted.
The results are shown in Table #1. C0,, alcohol soluble,
and insoluble portions are expressed as percent of the total
'C taken up. Figure l shows the rates of uptake over the
entire 12 hours. Uptake for the first 2 hours is linear. Also,
20%-50% of the amino acids taken up were metabolized to C0..
were selected
Glysine and glutamic acidfor further study because of
the difference in their conversion to C0, and incorporation
into the amino acid pools.
