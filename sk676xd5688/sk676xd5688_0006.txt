Uptake of Amino Acid by Metridium senile
Bacterial Affects on Uptake
The contribution to catabolism by bacteria associated
with the anemone was assessed by observing uptake and conversion
to CO, in the presence and absence of Streptomyocin at a concentratio
of 50/g/ml. Uptake by 5 different animals in the presence of
this antibiotic was compared with the uptake by 5 animals in the
absence of the bacteristatic substance. Incubation was for only
Whours. The results are presented in Table f2.
Streptomyocin had no significant affect on the amount of
C-labeled amino acids taken up or catabolized. In this experiment
which utilized a larger number of animals, a correlation between
body weight and percent uptake, r-.85, p.01, was observed and
permitted percent uptake to be expressed in terms of the gram
dry weight of the anemone. Note that almost twice as much
glutamic acid was converted to labeled CO, as glysine.
To further substantiate the minimal involement in the effects
observed, 4canemones were shaken in 50ml. of sea water to release
bacteria attached to their outer surfaces.. The anemone was then
removed, labeled glysine and glutamic acid added, and the decrease
in specific activity measuredover 24 hours. Results are shown in
Table f3. During the first 4 hours bacteria had little affect
