Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
INTRODUCTION
Since the early 1960's many marine organisms have been
shown to take up dissolved organics such as amino acids and
glucose. Stephens gives a good summary of this work (Stephens
1968) and concludes that it can be energetically significant
to the animal. The major work on coelenterates has been done
over the past 4 years by Schlichter on Anemonia sulcata. He
has found that there is active uptake of the amino acids from
sea water, that this uptake is through the ectoderm, and
suggests that the animal could satisfy much of their energy
requirements in this way (Schlichter, 1974). However, it still
remains to be demonstrated that there is a net uptake of amino
acids, and the amounts which are removed from sea water are
nutritionally significant.
The animal used in the study reported here was Metridium
senile, (Linnaeas, 1767) collected in Monterey Bay from an
area of high dissolved organic content, little water movement
necessary for particle feeding, and therefore, from a situation
in which direct uptake of dissolved organics would be a benefit
