24 hours in the presence of streptomyocin a similiar/was found.
In the absence of the antibiotic a significant affect apparently
due to bacteria, was observed.
Release of Amino Acids from Metridium senile
In this experiment six animals, described in Table #2, were
incubated in the labeled substrate solutions for 4 days to permit
equilibration of labeled and unlabeled amino acids in the animals
tissue. At the end of this period the animal was washed four
times in sea water and then placed in 100ml. of filtered sea
water. The release rates of labeled material were then measured
as a function of the increase in non-CO, carbon-14 in the sea
water. At the end of the experiment the anemones were extracted i
in 70% ethanol, and the levels of 170 -labeled amino acids
determined. The results are shown in Table #4. The anemone exhibits
a net release of glysine over the 4 hour period, and a net uptake
of glutamic acid.
Uptake in Fed versus Starved Anemones
Ten Metridium senile, varying in weight by no more than
.2 grams wet weight, were collected from the same clone. They
were placed in beakers and maintained in running filtered sea water
for two weeks. During the following two weeks, only 5 of the 10
