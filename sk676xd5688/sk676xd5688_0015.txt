initial
and distribution of 10-labeled materials in Metridium
senile. Distribution of the 170 is given as percent
of total incorporated 170.
Table 2.
Percent uptake and 1002 production by Metridium
senile in solutions with C-labeled glysine and
glutamic acid, with and without an antibiotic
present.
Table 3.
Percent uptake of 1C-labeled glysine and glutamic acid
by bacteria, with and without an antibiote present.
Table 4.
Net movement of glysine and glutamic acid is calculated
by determing the total uptake to total release ratio.
All values for uptake, release, 170. Amino acids, and
total amino acids are given in mMol/gm. dry wt.
