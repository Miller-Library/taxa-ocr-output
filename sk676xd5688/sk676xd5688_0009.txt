Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
for glysine. These results can be explained by the reports
that uptake rates exhibit enzyme kinetics. (Taylor, 1969; Shick,
1975; Stephens 1963). The observed uptake of amino acids and
conversion to CO, cannot be attributed to bacteria because
of the high uptake rates in the presence of streptomyocin. Twice
as much of the incorporated glutamic acid was converted to C02 as
compared to glysine. To compare the 10,/ 1200, ratio in the
animal, and determine the nutritional contributions of dissolved
glysine and glutamic acid, the CO, excretion values for Metridium
as determined by Parker were used. (Parker, 1923). This shows
glysine could account for 12.5% of the animals CO, and glutamic
acid 24.4%. These values suggest that dissolved organics may
account for substantial amounts of the anemone's nutrition in
some situations.
The release rates from the anemone were calculated for
glysine and glutamic acid following the guidelines established
by Johonnes, Coward, and Webb, (1969). A net release of glysine was
found, while there was a net uptake of glutamic acid. This is
energetically resonable if one compares the amounts which are
used in metabolism, and it demonstrates the same results which
Ferguson found in starfish (1971). Because of the high concentratio
gradient, 102:1, the uptake of glutamic acid may be explained
