Uptake of Amino Acids by Metridium senile
ABSTRACT
1. Metridium senile incorporated between 30% and 60% of
the 7C-labeled glysine, valine, glutamic acid, lysine,
and an algal mixture when they were present at natural
concentrations.
33% of the glysine and 66% of the glutamic acid incorporated
by the anemone was metabolized to C0.. This could account
for 12% to 24% of the animals total CO, pbduction.
The rates of release for glysine and glutamic acid are
calculated. There is a net loss of glysine and a net
uptake of glutamic acid by the anemone.
In starved versus fed anemones, the starved animals
take up glysine and produce 1700, in significantly
higher amounts. The advantage of this to Metridium
senile is discussed.
