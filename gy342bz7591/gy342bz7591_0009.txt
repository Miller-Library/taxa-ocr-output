contractions (Bone and Howarth. 1980, Florey et al. 1985). Slow muscle
responded by a slow and elongated contraction as observed in this
investigation. Similarly, TTX effectively blocked nerve propagation, but
failed to block a response to direct application of glutamate (see figure
6). However, this alone is not enough to conclude that glutamate acts
postsynaptically as Florey and Woodcock (1968) discovered in their
work with crab muscle. Although L-glutamate has been found to be
generally excitatory, there is also evidence for it acting as a blocker to
transmission at the giant synapse of the squid stellate ganglion (Kelly
and Gage, 1969) and as an inhibitory transmitter on cell bodies of
stellate ganglion neurons (Bevan et al, 1975).
The three glutamate antagonists all proved ineffective at being able
to reversibly block neuromuscular transmission although they were
shown to be effective blockers to glutamate in squid chromatophore
muscles (Florey et al, 1985). While the glutamate itself was excitatory
on at least the slow muscle, the blockers presumably did not diminish
twitch activity because the slow muscle was not being stimulated
significantly with single shocks. The giant axons are thought to run only
into the central circular muscle where the fast muscle fibers are found.
Therefore, if only fast muscle is being stimulated, the blockers would
have no effect if the glutamate were only affecting the slow muscle.
This is consistent with the data that shows that the blockers were
largely ineffective at blocking neuromuscular transmission.
Although only a few of the criteria for establishing the identity of a
neurotransmitter have been met (Dorsett 1975), the evidence suggests
