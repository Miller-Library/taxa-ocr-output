Potential neurotransmitters used were L- glutamate, acetylcholine,
betaine, taurine, isotheonic acid, and octopamine all in 2mM
concentrations. Antagonistic che micals in concentrations ranging from
2-20mM include glutamate diethyl ester, glutamate A methyl ester, and
2 amino 4 phosphoro butyric acid. Also used were TTX (20-200 nM),
Na-free sea water (450 mM N-methyl glucamine-Cl. 60mM Cacl,, 10
mM KCI, 10 mM HEPES), low Ca seawater, and 10 mM Co seawater.
Preparations and solutions were all kept at 9-11Â° C and muscle tissure
was manually washed by pippetting solutions into and out of the glass
preparation dish with the tissue pinned down to a piece of Sylgard.
Individual muscle cells were obtained by soaking tissue in 1mg/ml
sterilized seawater solution of Type 1 A Collagenase (obtained from
Sigma) for 1- 3 hours. Tissue was then centrifuged for 5 minutes and
the collagenase was replaced by an L-15 (Gibco) based culture medium
containing 62 fetal bovine serum medium (Hyclone) and extra salts to
achieve final concentrations 10 mM CaCl,, 10 mM KCl, 50 mM MgCL,, and
434.2 mM Nacl in distilled water. The tissue was then vortexed for 3
minutes and centrifuged for one more minute then plated on 12
poly-L-lysine coated coverslips. Voltage clamp experiments were done
as described by Brismar and Gilly (1987). Glutamate was also applied
directly to isolated cells in sterile seawater via a micropippette and a
pressure injection apparatus.
