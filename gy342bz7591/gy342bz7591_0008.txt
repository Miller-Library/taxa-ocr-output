contraction extending for about I minute and gradually decreasing to a
near-baseline level. The response appears more similar to slow muscle
contraction as glutamate does not give rapid twitch-like responses
assosciated with fast muscle. Instead, it acts antagonistically to inhibit
the fast responses which decrease following glutamate application and
increase again upon washing out with seawater (figure 7). The
excitatory effect of glutamate does not appear to be due to activation of
axons as shown in figure 8. TTX was first applied to block the axons
innervating the muscle, but the glutamate response is unaffected.
Glutamate blockers were also applied which act antagonistically to
glutamate receptors in other systems (Florey et al, 1985). Figure 9
shows typical results of three such blockers on an isolated muscle strip
None of the antagonists exhibited convincing reversal. When a
glutamate solution was applied in the presence of antagonist, the muscle
still exhibited contraction though at a lessened amplitude. It was
therefore concluded that glutamate was probably not the transmitter
involved at the neuromuscular junction of the fast muscle since the
blockers did prevent synaptic transmission.
Discussion
It appears that glutamate acts to excite certain muscle in the squid
and may possibly act to inhibit others. In similar experiments where
glutamate was hypothesized as a neurotransmitter on fast and slow
muscle in molluscs, it affected fast muscle by causing a series of rapid
