Figure 1: Electrical and contractile recordings from full mantle
preparation. A shows electrical activity recor ded from contact electrode
in muscle and B shows fast muscle contraction following electrical
activity.
Figure 2: Electrical activity from stimulation of full mantle preparation.
A and B show electrical muscle response before and after repeated
stimulation.
Figure 3: Fast and slow contractile responses.
A demonstrates a fast contraction at high speed and B shows the slow
fiber activation after fast muscle fatique.
Figure 4: Effect of 20 nM TTX on twitch response ofmuscle strip
preparation.
Inactivation of axons is demonstrated by decreased response then
reversal with washing. Downward arrow represents washing in of TIX
and upward arrow represents washing out.
Figure 5: Effects of 10mM Co/ Na free (50 mM Ca) on twitch response.
Same muscle strip preparation shows inactivation of axon in case of Na
and presynaptic terminal in the case of Co. Upward and downward
arrows represent washing in and out of antagonists.
Figure 6: Effect of low Ca on twitch response.
Experiment on full mantle preparation shows effect of blocking
neurotransmitter release at presynaptic ter minal. Upward arrow
represents washing in and downward arrow represents washing out.
Figure 7: Application of L-glutamate and corresponding response.
Glutamate gives slow contraction but inhibits fast responses which
increase as glutamate is washed out of preparation.
Figure 8: Application of L-glutamate in presence of TTX.
Even with axons inactivated by TTX, glutamate response is still
significant.
