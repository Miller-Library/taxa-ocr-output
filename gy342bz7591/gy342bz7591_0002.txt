Introduction
The functions and properties of the giant axons in squid have been
well studied, but little is known about the obliquely striated mantle
muscle (Rosenbluth, 1972) innervated by the giant axon. For example,
motor ter minals of the giant axon have not been identified anatomically
(Bone and Pulsford, 1981), and the identity of neuromuscluar
transmitter is unknown. Similarly, little is known about the muscle,
e.g. whether the fibers generate action potentials. By applying potential
neurotransmitters as well as known blockers to synaptic transmission,
the synapses onto the muscle could be more easily understood.
Organization of squid mantle muscle has been deter mined by
anatomical data and physiological studies have yet to be conducted
(Gosline and DeMont, 1985). The mantle is composed primarily of
circular muscle tissue. The outer most layers are comprised of
slow-twitch fibers whereas the inner fibers are the fast-twitch muscle.
The slow muscles are used most often and are characterized by large
stores of mitochondria to provide ample amounts of ATP. The fast
muscles are only used in escape jetting when they are activated by the
giant axons. J. Z. Young (1938) reported that these giant axons act in an
"all or none" fashion, but that the muscles do not.
One unresloved issue involving these different muscle types
concerns the innervation of the muscles themselves. In another
invertebrate with obliquely striated muscle, Ascaris, innervation does
not occur via peripheral fibers, but through elongated processes that
