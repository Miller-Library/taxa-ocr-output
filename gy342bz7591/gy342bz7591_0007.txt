most visible following fatigue of the fast component, but in reality the
slow twitch is probably always present.
In order to conclude that test solutions were diffusing through the
muscle tissue, various known antagonists to axon propagation and
synaptic transmission were applied. Blockers were considered effective
if muscle twitches declined until the antagonist was removed and then
then gradually increased back towards the original level. Tetrodotoxin
prevents action potential transmission along axons by blocking Na
channels. Even in low concentrations, TTX effectively blocked
transmission in muscle strip preparations (figure 4). Sodium-free
artificial seawater (ASW) acts similarly to TTX by re moying
extracellular sodium and preventing action potentials. Solutions can
thus gain access to axonal elements in muscle strip preparations.
Solutions were also applied which were designed to disrupt
neuromuscular transmission. Cobalt ions also block twitches.
presumably by inhibiting the amount of Ca influx at the presynaptic
motor ter minal and thereby decreasing neurotransmitter release (figure
5). Figure 6 shows how low Ca seawater acts similarly by reducing the
amount of extracellur Ca and thereby effecting the amount of
neurotransmitter released (Llinas, 1982).
Mantle strips were then exposed to bath application of various
potential excitatory solutions. Acetylcholine proved ineffective as did
betaine, taurine, isotheonic acid. and octopamine. These amino acids
known to exist in the axoplasm of axons (Prosser, 1972). Only
L-glutamate gave an excitatory response characterized by a gradual
