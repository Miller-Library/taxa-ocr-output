Full mantle preparations, even with the inner collagen tunic
remoyed, proved to be far less effective than isolated muscle strips in
washing chemicals in and out quickly. Therefore, the majority of
experiments were carried out using isolated pieces of lateral mantle
tissue containing both slow and fast twitch fibers. Figure lA shows the
electrical activity recorded through a seawater filled polyethylene tube
pressed up against the muscle in a full mantle preparation. Such
activity is followed by muscle twitch as shown in figure IB. Figure 2A
shows a portion of this electrical activity at a faster sweep speed. An
initial small, fast action potential is visible and is followed by a larger
and much slower response. Following stimualation for several seconds
at 20 Hz. the larger response is greatly reduced in amplitude (Figure
3B), while the earlier action potential is unaffected. Presumably the
small spike reflects activity in small branches of axons which send
identical signals to the neuromuscular junction even after repetitive
stimulation. The origin of the slower response is not so clear but it may
reflect electrical activities of muscle cells, because this activity précèdes
force development. The electrical activity at the muscle obviously
changes although the axon spike remains unchanged. Another type of
fatigue is seen in measuring muscle twitches. Figure 3A shows how the
contractile responses also decline after repetitve stimulation at à much
lower frequency (0.05 Hz). Following 20 min of such stimulation, twitch
amplitude fell to one-fifth its original value and a second, slow phase of
the twitch becomes obvious. Such slow muscle responses were only
observed in isolated muscle strip preparations. These responses are
