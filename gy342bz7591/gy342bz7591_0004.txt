Materials and Methods
Squid mantles were prepared from Loligo opalescens netted from
Monterey Bay. Preparations were obtained by decapitating the animals
and making a ventral cut along the length of the mantle. The pen as
well as all interior organs were removed and the resulting full mantle
preparation was left intact with both stellate ganglia and all the
accompanying giant fibers. A second mantle preparation involved
manually removing the inner collagen tunic to enable quicker diffusion
of bath applied solutions. An excised muscle preparation was also
obtained by cutting a strip (20mm X 3mm) of tissue in a direction
transverse to the animals long axis (ie., in parallel wtih the circular
muscle fibers).
A suction electrode with a nalgene tip was attached to a Grass S44
stimulator which was used to directly stimulate giant fibers in full
mantle preparations. Twitch responses were measured with a force
transducer and recorded on a Gould 220 dual pen chart recorder.
Muscle were stimulated using C-shaped Pt/Pt black foil electrodes
(3XSmm) mounted 1.5 cm apart and a few mm from the muscle. A
force transducer made from Pixie Se miconductor elements (Gilly and
Schuer, 1984) was used to measure twitch responses. Stimulations
were nor mally given once every 20 seconds with 70 V 3 msec pulses.
A polyethylene contact electrode (diameter 2.5 mm) with silver/silver
chloride wire was also used to record electrical activity and infor mation
was conveyed via a Nicolet 3091 oscilloscope.
