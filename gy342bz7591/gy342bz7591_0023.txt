Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to everyone involved in the
175H program. Thanks go to Carol Marzuola for finding whatever I
needed when nobody else knew where to look and to Bruce Hopkins for
spending long and lonely nights at the Wharf to keep us supplyed with
squid. I also appreciated the enthusiasm and constructive criticisms of
Stuart Thompson, the help from Chuck Baxter in locating several
applicabse articles, and the equipment loaned to me by Mark Denny.
am particularly indebted to my adviser W. F. Gilly. His honesty and
criticisms were an invaluable asset in completing this project but it was
his guidance and seemingly endless hours of attention which I value the
most.
