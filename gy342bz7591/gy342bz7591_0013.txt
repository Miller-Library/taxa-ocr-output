Figure 9: Twitch responses to glutamate antagonists.
None of the three antagonists tested reversibly blocked stimulation.
Downward arrows represent washing in and upward arrows represent
washing out of antagonists.
Figure 10. Model for hypothesized transmission.
Glutamate appears to inhibit fast response but act excitatory to slow
response.
