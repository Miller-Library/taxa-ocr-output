Abstract
Neuromuscular transmission in the squid is described in terms of the
slow and fast fibers characterizing circular mantle muscle. Various
potential transmitter substances and antagonists to synaptic
transmission were tested by electrically stimulating giant fibers and
recording twitch responses of the circular muscle in the presence of the
substances tested. Of these, bath application of L-glutamate had an
excitatory effect on circular mantle tissue. Antagonists to L- glutamaté
known to mediate synaptic transmission in other neuromuscular
systems had no reversible inhibitory effect on transmission. It is
concluded that L- glutamate or a glutamate analog may directly excité
the slow circular fiber. The apparently inhibiting action of glutamate on
fast fibers innervated by the giant axons may arise either
presynaptically or postsynaptically.
