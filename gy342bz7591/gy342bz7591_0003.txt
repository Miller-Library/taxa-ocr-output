arise from the muscle cells themselves and run to the ventral nerve
cords (Rosenbluth, 1972). In the squid, two motor systems exist and
the possibility exists of dual innervation of single muscle fibers(Wilson,
1960). The outer zone of the mantle containing the slow muscle is
probably not innervated in the same way as the inner zone. The giant
axon branches supply the circular muscle of the inner zone and there
are probably smaller axons which innervate both the outer and inner
circular muscle (Bone and Pulsford, 198 1).
Traditionally, fast muscle in vertebrates is thought to generate
actions potentials which aid in simultaneous activation of a long muscle
fiber over its entire length. However, systems have been described
where the fastest fibers in at least one vertebrate, a fish, do not show
action potentials. Instead, these muscles rely on the temporal
summation of end plate potentials (Gilly and Aladjen, 1987). Action
potentials in squid fast muscle have not been observed although Ca
action potentials have been observed in many other invertebrates.
Nothing is known about the transmitters at either slow or fast fiber
neuromuscular junctions in the squid. Glutamate is a good candidate,
though based on work on chromatophore muscle (Florey et al, 1985). It
has also been shown to be capable of both excitation and inhibition by
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing squid neurons. Glutamate may work
via a presynaptic action as it din crustacean muscle (Florey and
Woodcock, 1968) by causing an increase in miniature potentials which
summate to act postsynaptically.
