TABLE 2
Response to Thais emarginata. All bowls contained 100 ml. of
sea water. 1-2 Thais emarginata were placed in the test bowl at
least one hour prior to the beginning of tests. A snail was
considered to be responding as long as the anterior portion of
his shell was above the air-water interphase. No animal was
subjected more than twice to the Thais stimulus. The test
interval was 9 minutes from the introduction of the Littorina
into the water.
