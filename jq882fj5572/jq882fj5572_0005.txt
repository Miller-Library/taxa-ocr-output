live lower because of the macroscopic algae it eats and its inferior
ability to withstand dessication,2 but it must also protect itself more
carefully against being washed away.
When a Littorina descends below its lower limit, predation becomes
a factor. Though Acanthina spirata, to some extent, live among the
Littorina, they do not seem to make large inroads into the population.
Other predators are more voracious, but being well below Littorina, have
little contact with them. Cancer antennarius and Cancer productus eat
Littorina at a tremendous rate when in contact with them, and even young
Cancers rip apart the Littorina's shell like a monkey peeling a banana.
Patiria miniata also prey on Littorina when they are within reach, and
probably accounted for the deaths of 50% of ten L. planaxis tethered
two feet above mean low water (two feet below their normal height in
this area) on algae covered rocks in a semi-quiet area. The remains of
these snails were unmarked, empty shells identical to those of L.
planaxis eaten by Patiria in the lab. It is very unlikely that Pisaster
ochraceus was responsible for the predation attributed to Patiria as
no Pisaster has been observed to eat a L. planaxis and only.3% have
been observed to eat L. scutulata. It took two and one-half weeks for
all the tethered snails to be killed, and a migration of Littorina to a
slightly lower level would, thus, not be met by prohibitive predation.
When a Littorina is washed away, unless it manages to cling to a
rock on which it can leave the water, it will eventually contact a
Cancer or Patiria and be destroyed. Patiria are so abundant at lower
depths that a Littorina washed out of the intertidal zone would have
practically no chance to escape. To even further reduce the odds,
