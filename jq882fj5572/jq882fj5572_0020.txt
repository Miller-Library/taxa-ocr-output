TABLE 4
Response of Littorina scutulata to an homogenate of the foot
of Acanthina spirata. All bowls contained 100 ml. of sea water.
To the test bowl was added approximately 0.16 ml. homogenate prepared
by homogenizing the foot of one Acanthina spirata in 10 ml. of
artificial sea water. The test interval was 10 minutes from the
introduction of the Littorina into the water, and all tests were
conducted in the dark. A snail was considered to be responding
as long as the anterior portion of his shell was above the air-
water interphase. No animal was subjected more than twice to
the test stimulus.
