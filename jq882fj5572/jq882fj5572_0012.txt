substituted as a stimulus in 100 ml. of sea water and yielded
a positive response, strongly implicating a diffusible chemical
as the stimulus. (Table 3.)
The above computations are based on only the first two
exposures to the stimulus for each animal used. As Figure 1
illustrates, the response of both species falls off significantly
on the third exposure to Acanthina stimulus. Fourth trials were
seldom run, and rarely did they yield significant increases over
the control responses.
As a first step toward localizing the stimulus, two Acanthina
were cut into three gross portions, with the kidneys and digestive
glands placed in one bowl, the feet and operculums placed in a
second bowl, and the head, mantle and medial sections in a
third bowl. After one hour, assays were run on each bowl as
above. Only the foot section yielded a significant response.
However, this response was much less distinct than the response
to an active Acanthina, and it was significant only for the first
one or two times test animals were exposed to the stimulus.
Thereafter even fresh periwinkles failed to respond. This
suggested that attachment to the substrate or actual movement was
a factor in the secretion of the active substance.
To check the mucus trails for activity, Acanthina were removed
from a bowl where they had been active for at least 90 minutes.
The bowl was emptied and gently rinsed in fresh circulating sea
water, and then refilled with 100 ml. of fresh sea water. Activity
was still demonstrable in the bowl. Five Acanthina were left in
