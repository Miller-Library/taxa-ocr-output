Figure 1. Fatiguing in the response of Littorina planaxis and
Littorina scutulata to stimulus by Acanthina spirata. White bars
represent L. scutulata, black bars represent L. planaxis. C, rep-
resents the response of each group of animals on their first test
in the controlw√•ter, A, represents the response of each group of
animals on their first exposure to the bowl containing A. spirata,
; the response of the same animals on their second test in the
control water, etc. Both control and test bowls contained 100 ml.
of sea water. A snail was considered to be responding as long
as the anterior portion of his shell was above the air-water
interphase.
