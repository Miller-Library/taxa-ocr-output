Cancers patrol up to the water level and would snatch up an occassional
loose snail.
Thus, the physical force of water and the biological force of pre-
dation combine to set a lower limit on the habitation of Littorina.
This limit facilitates their survival and functions through a mechanism
of negative geotaxis. It is possible that long ago, the ancestors of
these Littorina developed in two directions. One branch had a negative
geotaxis and climbed out of the water. The other branch may have had a
positive geotaxis or none. Those Littorina living below the water were
eventually eaten by crabs, starfish, and fish while those above the sea
have survived.
