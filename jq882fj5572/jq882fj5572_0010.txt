The effectiveness of this response in reducing predation is
not clear. BIGLER (1964) at the Hopkins Marine Station suggests
that Acanthina spirata is the most significant predator on Littorina
planaxis, at least within the periwinkle's natural range, and all
attacks observed by him or by this writer have occurred underwater.
Acanthina are occasionally found in pools feeding on L. scutulata.
However, laboratory evidence suggests that both species of Littorina
quickly lose the response on repeated exposure to the stimulus.
(See Figure 1.) L. scutulata and Acanthina are sometimes found
in very close proximity in a pool, particularly if the whelk is
wedged inactively into a small crevice or partially burrowed
into coarse sand.
Laboratory observations. The increased tendency of the peri-
winkles to leave the water in the presence of Acanthina provided
a simple laboratory assay for investigating the stimulus. For
the original stimulus, two Acanthina spirata were placed in
100 ml. of sea water in a clean finger bowl for at least one
hour prior to the first tests. One hundred milliliters of sea
water was used as a control. In some cases two herbivorous black
turban snails (Tegula funebralis ) were placed in sea water in
another bowl as a second control. For the initial determinations
one of the two Acanthina or Tegula was left in the bowl during
the tests.
All animals were freshly gathered before each series of tests.
For more uniform results, Littorina gathered from the rocks were
placed in sea water until they had opened and attached before trials
were started.
