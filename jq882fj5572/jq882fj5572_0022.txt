Figure 2. Dialysis of the response-eliciting secretion of Acanthina
spirata as measured by the response of Littorina scutulata. The
white bar represents the response in the control water; the black
bar represents the response to the water containing the stimulus
to be assayed. The figures above each column are the fraction of
snails responding in the test interval. The probabilities for a
random distribution in each case are computed by chi-square. All
bowls contained 100 ml. of sea water. A snail was considered to
be responding as long as the anterior portion of his shell was
above the air-water interphase.
A. Response of L. scutulata to 100 ml. of sea water against which
one A. spirata in 10 ml. sea water has dialyzed 10 hours. The test
interval was 8 minutes from the introduction of the Littorina
into the water.
B. Response of L. scutulata to 100 ml. of sea water against which
10 ml. of sea water taken from a jar full of A. spirata has
dialyzed 14 hours. The test interval was 9 minutes.
C. Response of L. scutulata to the dialysis residue of the
homogenate of the foot of A. spirata. The foot of 1 A. spirata
was homogenized in 10 ml. of sea water. 0.16 Milliters of the
homogenate in 10 ml. of sea water was dialyzed 12 hours against
100 ml. of sea water and the residue added to 100 ml. of sea water
in the test bowl. The test interval was 10 minutes and all tests
were conducted in the dark.
D. Response of L. scutulata to 100 ml. of sea water against which
O.16 ml. of homogenate of the foot of A. spirata had dialyzed for
12 hours. The test interval was 10 minutes, and all tests were
conducted in the dark.
