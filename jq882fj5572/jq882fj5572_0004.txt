L. planaxis tethered to one of the rocks, only one was eaten - probably
by a crab as indicated by a broken shell -- in three days. Predation
would take longer than several days to deplete a colony of Littorina at
this level.
On a relative basis, L. scutulata and L. planaxis are less able to
withstand water flow than Tegula brunnea and Calliostoma canaliculatum.
L. planaxis, but not L. scutulata, however, can better withstand water
flow than can Tegula funebralis. This was determined by subjecting
fifty of each snail to a stream of water with a flow of 12.2 liters per
minute and a tube diameter of .85 centimeters (figure 2). Tegula
funebralis manage to live at a lower level than L. planaxis because its
response to water flow is to go to the base of the rock and reduce flow
to a minimum. L. planaxis, with its negative geotaxis, goes to the top
of the rock where, when the rock is inundated, the shearing force is
greatest.
Among L. planaxis, the medium large size (12-15 millimeters across
the base of the shell) was observed to best withstand water flow. This
size L. planaxis makes up to 80% of the population in heavy surf areas
while contributing far less of the total population. This shows, again,
that wave action determines where Littorina can live.
These results seemingly present a paradox because, though L. scutu-
lata are less able than L. planaxis to cope with water flow, they live at
a lower level in most cases. As figure 1 shows, L. scutulata do not live
as low as L. planaxis in heavy surf areas; and in everyplace but the
quiet areas, the L. scutulata are wedged into crevices or among barn-
acles while the L. planaxis are on the open faces. L. scutulata must
