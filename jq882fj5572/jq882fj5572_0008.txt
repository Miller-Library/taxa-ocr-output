CHEMICALLY STIMULATED ESCAPE RESPONSES OF
LITTORINA PLANAXIS AND LITTORINA SCUTULATA TO
THE CARNIVOROUS GASTROPOD ACANTHINA SPIRATA
The escape responses of certain gastropods when stimulated
by predatory sea stars has long been known. (BAUER, 1913;
WEBER, 1924; HOFFMAN, 1930; BULLOCK, 1953; FEDER, 1963; MARGOLIN,
1964.) CLARK (1958) has described flight responses by herbivorous
gastropods on contact with a variety of carnivorous gastropods.
HOFFMAN (1930), BULLOCK (1953), and FEDER (1963) present evidence
that the primary stimulus of the sea stars is chemical. Although
CLARK (1958), working with crude homogenates, suggested that
the response to carnivorous gastropods is also chemically
stimulated, little further work on the nature of the stimulus is
available.
The animals used in this study were the predacious Muricid
whelks, Acanthina spirata (Blainville) and Thais emarginata
(Deshayes), common to the Monterey coast, and the common periÂ¬
winkles of the rocks and pools in the high intertidal and splash
zones, Littorina planaxis Phillipi, and Littorina scutulata Gould.
Observations and Discussion

an Acanthina spirata was introduced into a quiet splash pool in
