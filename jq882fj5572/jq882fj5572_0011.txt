the shell to the widest point of the basal whorl) or L. planaxis
(9/32-15/32 inches) were dropped into a finger bowl and the number
of responses recorded at one-minute intervals. A snail was
considered positively responding as long as the anterior portion
of his shell was at all above the water. All tests were run at
approximately 20 degrees Centigrade.
On the basis of this data a test interval was chosen for the
comparison of control and test responses. The optimum interval
varied from run to run and especially from day to day, but results
were generally comparable within the interval from 7 to 9 minutes.
Each group of animals was allowed to drain one minute between trials
and was tested at least once in the control water between exposures
to the Acanthina stimulus. A typical run consisted of three
exposures to the Acanthina stimulus and at least four control
trials. A new group of periwinkles was used for each run. Test
responses were compared statistically with the natural tendency
of the Littorina to leave the water under control conditions.
Both L. scutulata and L. planaxis showed a clear response
to Acanthina and no significant response to the herbivore Tegula
funebralis when compared with the sea water control. See Table 1.
Under similar conditions both Littorina species responded sig-
nificantly to the carnivorous whelk Thais emarginata, whose range
also occasionally overlaps their ranges. (Table 2.) In most
responses no physical contact with the whelks was necessary.
Ten to twelve milliliters of sea water in which several
Acanthina had been placed for at least four hours was then
