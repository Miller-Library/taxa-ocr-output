readjusted to pH 8.0-8.5.
The active substance does not appear to be macromolecular,
however, and a substance capable of eliciting the response was
demonstrated to be dialyzable at various points in the process:
as secreted by a live Acanthina spirata in 10 ml. of sea water
in a dialysis membrane overnight, as present in sea water in
which several Acanthina had been placed earlier, and finally, as
present in the homogenate of the foot of A. spirata. (Figure 2.)
After dialysis of the homogenate (10 ml. against 100 ml. of
sea water) the active substance can be extracted with ether from
the dialysate at pH 2.6 and redissolved in sea water. The
activity of the crude homogenate seems to decline more rapidly
than that of the dialysis purified extract, even under refrigeration.
Summary
The predacious Muricid whelk, Acanthina spirata, secretes
a substance which diffuses from its pedal mucus and to which
Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata respond by accelerated
motion and an increased tendency to leave the water. Homogenates
of the foot of A. spirata have been prepared capable of eliciting
a similar response, and the active substance in the homogenates
shown to be dialyzable and ether extractable from acidified solutions.
Both L. planaxis and L. scutulata show a similar response to
the Muricid whelk Thais emarginata.
