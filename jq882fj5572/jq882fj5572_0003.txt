which the Littorina population begins varies with the turbulence of the
tidal flow in that area. In areas of very heavy surf, L. planaxis do
not venture below nine and one-half to ten and one-half feet above
mean low water. In very quiet areas, L. planaxis live as low as one and
one-half feet above mean low water. Heights for other areas vary be-
tween these two extremes, but always in relation to the water action in
the area. Figure ! was made from a typical area of rock with the outer
face exposed directly to waves, a middle inlet with mediwm turbulence,
and a back inlet with very little flow accompanying the rise and fall
of the tide. As the areas become quieter, the level of the densest
population of both L. planaxis and L. scutulata becomes lower, and even
moving over seven feet on the front face -- where lower rocks break up
the waves -- enables L. planaxis to live three feet lower.
Several transplantations of L. planaxis and L. scutulata to low
rocks one-half to one and one-half feet above mean low water -- sur-
rounded by sand to prevent the snails' escape - resulted in 10% to 50%
disappearance in twenty-four hours, 75% to 96% disappearance in fourty-
eight hours, and 97% to complete disappearance in four days. Within
two weeks, every one of three hundred Littorina put on the rocks was
gone. These rocks are naturally inhabited by Tegula funebralis;
Tegula brunnea and Calliostoma canaliculatum put on the same rocks
were still there after three weeks. These tests were run on a quiet
beach; on a rough beach, 100% loss occurred over night.
Physical conditions, and not predation, were mainly responsible for
the vanishing of the Littorina off the rocks. Most of the Littorina
found after the first day were on different rocks, and of twenty
