which no other whelks were found, he would soon right himself and
begin to move about slowly and hesitantly. Within 2-5 minutes
Littorina planaxis or L. scutulata within a centimeter or two
would begin agitated movement, extending their tentacles and
crawling across the substrate at a noticeably more rapid rate than
those periwinkles at a greater distance. In large pools this
movement generally subsided when the Littorina was some distance
away from the whelk, but if this first, apparently random movement
brought the periwinkle into contact with the soft parts of the
Acanthina, his characteristic response was to raise up slightly
on the back half of the foot, swing abruptly around, and move
off very rapidly in a straight line in the opposite direction for
several centimeters. When the Littorina came into physical contact
with Acanthina, and also in smaller pools even when no actual
physical contact was involved, the tendency noted by FEDER (1963)
of "fleeing" periwinkles to move upward on sloping surfaces until
they have left the water was clearly noticeable. In response to
strong stimulus the cephalic tentacles of L. scutulata often whip
up and down apparently independently of one another.
In larger pools the whelk's "sphere of influence" gradually
extended until after 20-40 minutes he was sitting or slowly
moving in an area as much as 30 centimeters across which was
conspicuously clear of Littorina. An Acanthina weighted or
anchored in a pool so that he cannot right is apparently ignored
by the Littorina after the first 3-5 minutes. This may correlate
with the findings on the mucus trail of Acanthina which are
discussed below.
