TABLE 3
Response of Littorina planaxis to a diffusible chemical from
Acanthina spirata. All bowls contained 100 ml. of sea water.
To the test bowl was added 10-12 ml. of sea water in which several
Acanthina spirata had been placed at least four hours before
the tests. The test interval was 7 minutes from the introduction
of the Littorina into the water. A snail was considered to be
responding as long as the anterior portion of his shell was above
the air-water interphase. No animal was subjected more than
twice to the Acanthina stimulus.
