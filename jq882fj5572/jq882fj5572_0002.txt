While most intertidal organisms display a distinct upper habita-
tional limit, Littorina scutulata Gould (1849) and Littorina planaxis
Philippi (1847) have a distinct and unique lower limit. This limit is
set by a combination of physical and biological factors.
Chemical variants do not affect the lower limits as both Littorina
are able to cope with exposure to sea water. Biological competition and
food supply are not problems as there is no recurring pattern of animals
or algae below the Littorina; and even when no other snails are present,
Littorina will not move into lower areas abundant with the algae they
eat.
Submersion in water is also not a lower limiting factor for L.
scutulata, many of which live in tide pools, or L. planaxis. One hundred
and eighty L. planaxis were tested for righting responses and climbing
a vertical glass wall and were then put in a filled, covered tank with
a balanced flow of sea water. After twenty-five days of submersion,
these snails were again tested for righting and climbing. A comparison
ofthe time curves showed no impairment of ability after the submersion.
There was a definite non-responsiveness in about 20% of the L. planaxis
after the exposure, but this is little more than the non-responsiveness
of a random selection of L. planaxis from the field.
An increase in pressure and submersion, again, were eliminated as
lower limit determinants by placing ten L. planaxis, wrapped in plastic
screening, at a depth of thirty-three feet below mean low water. After
two week's submersion, all were retrieved in a healthy state.
The lower limits of Littorina are not uniform in different areas.
A correlation of heights and the type of area shows that the height at
