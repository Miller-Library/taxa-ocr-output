a bowl for two hours, and activity persisted in the bowl even
after it was leeched by submersion in running fresh sea water for
four hours (14 degrees C.). Finally two Acanthina were allowed
to crawl about for two hours in a Petri plate submerged in a
finger bowl without being allowed to contact the bowl itself. The
whelks and the Petri dish were then removed and the Petri dish
rinsed and partly filled with fresh sea water. The test snails
did not respond to the bowl or the water in it, but the same snails
responded clearly to the Petri dish (when compared to their
response in a clean, partly filled Petri dish), indicating that
the diffusible active substance is closely associated with the
pedal mucus secretions.
Active homogenates of the foot of Acanthina were then prepared
by homogenizing a foot in 10 ml. of artificial sea water in an
ice bath, centrifuging for five minutes, and decanting. In
testing homogenates, approximately 0.16 ml. of the homogenate was
transferred with a dropping pipette to a dry, clean bowl and
100 ml. of sea water added. For more sensitive assays in working
with small concentrations of the active substance, it proved
helpful to work with 10-12 Littorina at a time in the dark to
eliminate phototactic orientation and minimize clumping of the
snails. The test interval was ten minutes for all dark run tests.
Table 4 is a tabulation of such assays for a series of homogenates.
The activity of the homogenate was destroyed by two minutes
in a boiling water bath (sufficient to coagulate the protein), and
no significant activity was found in the supernatant after the
protein was removed by acid precipitation and the supernatant
