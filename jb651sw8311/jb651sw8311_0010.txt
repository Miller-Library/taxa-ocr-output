than that of the ocean. If they are acclimating to the lowest
temperature in their environment, they could indeed appear
cold-acclimated in comparison with subtidal chitons.
Vernberg and Vernberg (1970, p. 132) have suggested
that the temperate-zone crabs Uca pugnax (Rathbun, 1901)
are better able to adapt to temperature extremes than are their
tropical relatives Uca rapax (Rathbun, 1918) because they
are exposed to more temperature fluctuations. This
argument may apply to Tonicella in that subtidal chitons
are exposed to a more narrow temperature range and would be
expected to be less flexible in respiratory response than
intertidal ones. From Figure 5, subtidal Tonicella show a
a constant 0l0 near 2.5, while intertidal ones appear to
decrease their Olos in higher temperatures. Segal (1956)
has found similar patterns in his work with heart rate in
Acmaed, although Bullock and Rao (1954) stated that Oho
generally increases with temperature in molluscs such as
Mytilus salifornianus (Conrad, 1837). Since a lower 0
would be advantageous for an intertidal animal exposed
at midday low tide to the sun, this preliminary result should
be further tested by repetition of these experiments, including
teperatures higher than 239c.
