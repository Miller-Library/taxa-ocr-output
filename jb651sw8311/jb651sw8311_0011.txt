E. Kincannon Temperature Response in Tonicella
b values are plotted in Figure 6. Very little can be said
about the subtidal population (Figure 6-B) because of the
intertwining curves. However, it appears that acclimation
has occurred to some extent in the intertidal population
(Figure 6-A). The rate-temperature curve for 13°0
acclimated animals falls below that for 8°C acclimated
aniamls at all points, although the distinction between 13°C
and 18°C curves is less clear. This is probably due to
greater temperature fluctuations in the two warmer tanks than
in the 8°C holding tank. These results come after a
relatively short period of acclimation, and experiments
conducted for a longer time are necessary to determine
whether or not subtidal Tonicella in fact can acclimate.
Nonetheless, they support the argument of the preceding section
that intertidal Tonicella are capable of compensating for
changes in their environmental temperature and possibly
can do so better than the subtidal Tonicella.
The curves in Figure 6-A do not show the same pattern of
decreasing Q with increasing temperature as do the acutely
measured rate-temperature curves. However, the absolute
shape of these curves is not as accurate, since only one or
to experimental animals determined each point and b-values
were not measured for acclimated animals. The curves in
Figure 6 are useful only in comparison with each other.
There remains the possibility that acclimation observed
