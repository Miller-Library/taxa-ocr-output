Temperature Response in Tonicella

These data also suggest that vertical location does not
affect the relationship between body weight and respiratory
rate; there are no consistent differences in b between subÂ¬
tidal and intertidal Tonicella tested at the same temperature.
An average of all 10 slopes obtained yields a b-value of
0.73 for this species. This is similar to those of other
molluscs as reported by Prosser (1973, p. 193) and close to
Zeuthen's (1970) generalized metazoan value of 0.74.
Effect of temperature upon acute respiratory rate
Figure 5 shows acute rates of oxygen consumption for a
hypothetical 0.70 g chiton plotted against temperature. These
points are derived from the regression lines in Figures 3 and
4, and their significance is determined by the confidence
limits of those lines. It is apparent that the curve for
intertidal Tonicella does not lie below that for subtidal
Tonicella. Subtidal chitons therefore do not appear to be
cold-acclimated; these results suggest that they may even be
warm-acclimated since their rates are generally lower than
those of the intertidal population. Althought this seems
unlikely, the question cannot be resolved until it is known
to what aspect of the thermal regime these animals are
responding. According to temperature data from nearby
Moss Landing, California (Harrold, Christopher personal
communication, 1974), intertidal animals are frequently
exposed at low tide to air temperatures both higher and lower
