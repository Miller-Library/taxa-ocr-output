(Wood, 1815) were tested for acute and acclimated respiratory
rates at a series of five temperatures.
2. Tonicella show no diurnal or tidal rhythm in respiratory
rate.
seems unaffected by body weight in both populations.
3. 0,
4. Subtidal Tonicella are not acclimated in the field to a
colder temperature than are intertidal Tonicella, but may
be less able to compensate for temperature change.
5. Intertidal Tonicella show a pattern of acclimation after
three weeks in the labotatory; results from subtidal animals
are ambiguous.
