MATERIALS AND METHODS
All intertidal Tonicella were collected from Carmel
Point, Carmel, California, between O and 2 feet above mean
lower low water. Subtidal Tonicella were collected at a
depth of 20 to 26 feet off Mussel Point, Pacific Grove,
California. In the laboratory, all were held under constant
light in aquaria equipped with air stones. Constant temperature
was maintained by means of running sea water and immersion
heaters. Three holding tanks were maintained in this manner
at 8°C, 13°C, and 18° C; temperature was checked daily and
fluctuated + 2°C in the two warmer tanks, less in the 8°C
tank. Large glass jars covered with plastic screens served
both to keep the chitons submerged and to keep the popula¬
tions separate.
Rates of oxygen consumption were expressed on the basis
of wet weight which was measured by blotting the Tonicella
with paper towels before weighing. Fourteen chitons were
weighed after 29 hours in an 80°C oven. They were then
combusted at 600°C for 48 hours. Those initially weighing
over 2 g were combusted 6 days and reweighed. Percentages
of dry to wet weight, and ash-free to dry weight, were
subsequently calculated and plotted as a function of wet
weight.
Rates of oxygen consumption were measured at experimental
temperatures of 3°c, 8°c, 13°C, 18°C and 23°C using the direct
