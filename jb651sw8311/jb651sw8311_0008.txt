Temperature Response in Tonicella

Effect of body weight upon respiratory rate
Rates of oxygen consumption as a function of body weight
at five different temperatures in subtidal and intertidal
populations are plotted in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.
Slopes and 95% confidence limits for each regression line
appear in Table 1. Correction for weight by means of regression
analysis greatly reduced the variance in even these small
samples of rates; this suggests that at any given temperature,
weight is a more important determinant of respiratory rates
in Tonicella than are other factors such as sexual and nutritional
states.
Statistical comparison of the regression lines revealed
no consistent pattern of change in the slopes (b-values) as
a function of termperature. The slopes of subtidal animals
(Table 1) suggest a pattern of decreasing b-values with
decreasing temperature, but this is not a statistically significant
trend and does not appear in the intertidal population. It
may be concluded from this that b for this species does not
change with temperature, large and small Tonicella are equally
affected by temperature, and Q0 does not vary with size.
These conclusions represent an exception to the general rule.
For example, in intertidal invertebrates studied by Edwards
and Irving (1943), Bullock and Rao (1954) and Newell (1970).
b decreased with temperature and 9,
decreased with body
weight. The results presented here for Tonicella are
therefore quite significant, and need to be confirmed with
more data and clearer statistical conclusions.
