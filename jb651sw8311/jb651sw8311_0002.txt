Temperature Response in Tonicella

INTRODUCTION
Intertidal molluscs are known to show compensatory
changes in metabolic rate in response to different temperature
regimes. For example, some species from high latitudes have
the same rates of oxygen consumption as do related tropical
species at warmer temperatures (see reviews by Bullock,
1955, and Segal, 1961). Furthermore, this compensation, or
acclimation, has been shown between two spatially separated
populations of the same species. Low level populations of the
limpet Collisella limatula (Carpenter, 1864) show cold
acclimation of heart rate while high intertidal C. limatula
from a few feet away show warm acclimation (Segal, 1956).
Kenny (1958) suggests that this should apply to the Poly-
placophora as well; the chiton Clavarizona hirtosa (BlainÂ¬
ville) from low intertidal zones shows a lower upper lethal
temperature than those from comparatively higher, warmer
zones. However, no definitive work on acclimation as a
function of microgeographic separation has been done on the
Polyplacophora.
This study was designed to answer the following questions:
(1) Can chitons acclimate to altered temperatures
within a few weeks?
(2) If so, are subtidal animals acclimated to a
lower temperature than intertidal ones of the same species;
(3) Are intertidal animals, which are exposed to
