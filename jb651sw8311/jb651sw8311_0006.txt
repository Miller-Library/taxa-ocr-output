logarithmic transformation (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969). The
method of least squares (Ibid., Box 14.1) determined the
regression coefficients, and Fisher's F-test (Ibid., Box 8.1)
tested the significance of the lines. In the comparison
of regression lines with each other, the F-test was used to
compare slopes (Ibid., Box 14.8), while Student's T-test
(Ibid., Box 9.6) compared the means after a determination
that the variances were similar (Fisher's F-test as above).
The mean weight of all chitons collected was 0.70 g.
Rates of oxygen consumption for this weight were obtained
from the regression line at each temperature and plotted
on a rate vs. temperature graph. Assuming that b, the
slopgof the regression line, remains constant with
acclimation, rates of acclimated animals were standardized
to this same weight and plotted with the same procedure as
the acute rates. Since all rate-temperature curves were
plotted semilogarithmically, their slopes are directly proÂ¬
portional to Qjo as calculated by the formula:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Wet weight as a measure of metabolizing tissue
Figure I shows dry weight as a percentage of wet weight
and ash-free dry weight as a percentage of dry weight for a
nearly fifty-fold range of weights of Tonicella. Apparently
