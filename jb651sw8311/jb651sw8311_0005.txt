Warburg method of constant volume manometry as described by
Umbreit et al. (1972). After collection, Tonicella were
kept in the holding tank closest in temperature to that at
which they would be tested. Before the experiment they were
weighed, placed in the Warburg reaction vessel, and covered
with a measured volume of sea water filtered through a 0.22
u Millipore filter. Oxygen consumption by particles less than
0.22 u was assumed to be negligible. Two-tenths of a ml of
10% KOH was added to a filter paper wick located in the sideÂ¬
arm. After one hour of equilibration in the water bath,
manometer readings were taken at one-hour intervals for six
to twelve hours, depending upon the time required for
respiratory rates to stabilize. Hourly rates of oxygen uptake
were calculated and averaged over the time interval showing
the most consistent rates.
Notes on the animals' activity and degree of submersion
were kept throughout each experiment. Only the rates of
those chitons which appeared unhurt, remained submerged,
and did not move more than a few cm were used in further
calculations. Each chiton was used in only one experiment,
after which it was liberated.
Acute respiratory rates were measured 22 to 26 hours
after collection for six Tonicella at each temperature.
Rates of acclimated animals were measured after three
weeks using two specimens for each combination of acclimated
and experimental temperatures. A regression analysis was
performed on each set of acute rates measured, using a double
