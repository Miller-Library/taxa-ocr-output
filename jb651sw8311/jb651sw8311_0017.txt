Temperature Response in Tonicella

FIGURE CAPTIONS
Figure 1. Relationship between wet, dry, and ash-free dry
weights in selected Tonicella lineata of various sizes.
Upper plot is dry weight as a percentage of wet weight;
lower plot is ash-free dry weight as a percentage of
dry weight.
Figure 2. Respiratory rates of Tonicella lineata measured
over a 24-hour period. Change in manometer reading as
plotted is proportional to oxygen consumption. Weights
are those of the chitons tested.
Figure 3. Oxygen consumption as a function of body weight
for subtidal Tonicella lineata. Rates were measured at
five temperatures 24 hours after collection. Each point
represents one animal.
Figure 4. Oxygen consumption as a function of body weight
for intertidal Tonicella lineata. Rates were measured
at five temperatures 24 hours after collection. Each
point represents one animal..
Figure 5. Rate vs. temperature curves for intertidal ()
and subtidal (0) Tonicella lineata, measured acutely.
Points represent the intersection of a perpendicular,
erected at 0.70 g, with weight regression lines at each
temperature.
