E. Kincannon Temm rature Response in Tonicella Page 0
Abstract
Two vertically separated populations of Tonicella
neata (Wood) were tested for acute and acclimated resÂ¬
piratory rates at a series of five temperatures. Oxygen
uptake was considered as a function of both body weight
and temperature. Q in these chitons was not affected
by body weight. Intertidal Tonicella were shown to have
a greater ability to compensate for temperature changes
than the subtidal population; they showed better acclimation
patterns after three weeks in the laboratory and showed
decreasing 0's at higher temperatures while 0 of the
subtidal population remained constant. These results are
related to stability of temperature regimens in each habitat.
