E. Kincannon Temperature Response in Tonicella
in the laboratory is due to factors other than temperature.
Starvation is an obvious possibility; Newell (1970, p. 391)
reports that this is common and results in a decrease in
respiratory rate. However, at least one group of intertidal
Tonicella (8°c-acclimated, tested at 23°C) had higher rates
than did thecorresponding acutely measured group, and the
Tonicella were observed to deficate fecal pellets through¬
out their three weeks in the holding tanks. Possibly more
variation would have been introduced by trying to feed the
Tonicella than by starving them.
Future studies
An interesting question remaining is whether or not b
changes with laboratory acclimation. For the purposes of
this project no change was assumed, but this need verification.
Another topic is that of standard vs. active metabolism
and its effect on 9,: the 0,s found in this project are
higher than those given by Newell (1970) for standard
metabolism. Finally, once it has been determined that a
population of Tonicella can acclimate, transplantation
experiments would be helpful to test whether animals from
one habitat can acquire the ability to acclimate over a
short period of time.
