Temperature Response in Tonicella

the proportion of water (upper graph) and ash-weight (lower
graph) in Tonicella does not depend upon total wet weight.
Ash-free dry weight excludes the bulk of a chiton's
normetabolizing tissue—the shell plates. However, other
non-metabolizing elements such as fats and connective tissue
will combust and thus form part of the ash-free dry weight.
These could conceivably be present in larger amounts in larger
animals, leaving less metabolizing tissue in proportion, and
thus contribute to an overall decrease in weight-specific
metabolism in larger creatures. However, ash-free dry weight
has commonly been used as a measure of the amount of metabolizing
tissue in an organism. Since ash-free dry weight represents
a fairly constant proportion of weight weight. I chose to
compute weight-specific respiration in terms of wet
weight.
Stability of respiratory rates
To determine whether respiratory rates measured over
a 6 to 12-hour period are representative of an entire 24-hour
period, five chitons were tested for 24 hours. Change in
manometric pressure is plotted against time in Figure 2.
Although many species show a diurnal or tidal respiratory
rhythm, this is clearly not the case for Tonicella. (The
irregularity near 0800 hours was reflected by the thermo¬
barometer and is not due to changes in respiration.)
