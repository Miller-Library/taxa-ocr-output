Temperature Response in Tonicella
wide fluctuations in habitat temperature, better able to
acclimate to experimental temperatures than subtidal ani¬
mals, which experience a more limited temperature range?
The species Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815) was selected
for study because of its wide vertical distribution. In
addition to being abundant subtidally (Barnes, 1972, p. 67).
the species has been found by the author to occupy sides in
the intertidal up to three feet above mean lower low water.
Exchange of individuals between deepwater and shallow pop¬
ulations is probably small or nonexistanat (Demopulos, 1974).
Acute respiratory rates (oxygen consumption rates of
animals collected and held at constant temperature for
one day before measurement) were compared with rates of
acclimated aniamls (held three weeks at constant temperature
prior to measurement), at a series of five temperatures.
Rate of oxygen consumption was used as an indicator of
metabolic rate. Since many factors other than temperature
affect respiratory rate, notably body weight and activity
level, an attempt was made to study and correct for these
variables. There is evidence (Bullock and Rao, 1954) that
temperature affects the relationship between body weight and
respiratory rate. Consequently, weight-rate regressions were
done at each temperature for each population, using the
formula M = k-W. Where M = metabolic rate, K = a constant,
W - weight of the organism, and b - the regression coefficient.
