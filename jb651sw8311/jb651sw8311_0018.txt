Figure 6. Rate vs. temperature curves for intertidal (A)
and subtidal (B) Tonicella lineata acclimated to various
temperatures in the laboratory for three weeks. (8°C -2
13°c -+, 18°c -2). Each point is the mean of two animals,
corrected to a standard weight of 0.70 g as in Figure
5; vertical lines represent the range.
