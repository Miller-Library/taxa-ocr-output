CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
CONCLUSION
It becomes clear that light and an endogenous clock
can each cause a cercarial release. The four phase
shift experiments have shown that both an endogenous
clock and a sensitivity to light work together to govern
cercarial emergence rhythmicity. Although three of
the four phase shift experiments have shown that light
governs emergence more than the endogenous clock I can
not be sure that this is the actual case. Mbre prolonged
phase shift experiments could determine this. But
based on two LD 12:12 epperiments, one natural conditions
experiment, two constant environment experiments, and
four phase shift experiments I conclude that the
emergence of this undescribed species of trematode
cercaria from Battilaria attramentaria is governed by
both an endogenous clock and a photo sensitivity working
together in an equalibrium that follows LeChatelier's
principle.
