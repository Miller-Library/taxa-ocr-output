CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
DISCUSSION
The results of the preceding experiments eliminate
changing temperature asa possible que for cercarial
emergence. Results pertaining to light stimulation
and an endogenous clock are less clear cut and require
careful analysis.
The LD 12:12 experiments (Figures 1C and 20) may
be analyzed together. They both demonsrtate a rhythmic
pattern of cercarial emergence; light stimulation, an
endogenous clock, or a combination of these can explain
this phenomenon. Unfortunately none of these possible
causes can be preven or disproven.
The natural conditions experiment and the 28 hour
lab assay can also be grouped. Together they show that
emergence occures soon after illumination. The largest
peak on the natural conditions graph, 1639 to 1739, can
only be explained by that old biological adage "mother
nature is never wrong".
Constant environment experiments are accepted
assays for endogenous clocks. If a behavior is qued
by an external stimulus that behavior will not be
exhibited in the absence of that stimulus. If the
behavior is keyed to an endogenous clock the behavior
