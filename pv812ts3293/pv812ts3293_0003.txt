CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Battilaria attramentaria were collected from shallow
ponds at Bennett Slough, a branch of the Elkorn Slough,
Monterey Bay, California. Snails were kept alive in
aquaria with fresh flowing sea water; Ulva expansa and
"muck" were added as food. The aquaria were tilted so
that the snails could be dry or wet. The aquarium room
was illuminated by a skylight.
Only infected snails that were three centimeters or
longer from apex to canal were used. During the experi¬
ments snails were kept in labeled 30 ml glass vials
with 20 mls of sea water. At the end of each assay
period the sea water was filtered through Whatman No. 1
filter paper disks, employing an aspirater and a Milli-
pore filter. The filter paper disks were dried in a 78° C.
oven and the filtrate was discarded. After drying the
disks were sprayed with.3% ninhydrin in N-butanol.
Dark purple cercariae were then counted under a disecting
microscope.
A 20 watt General Electric F20T12-CW fluorescent
bulb was used to illuminate the snails. The bulb was 7 cm
above the snails. Light intensity at this distance was
254 uW/cm. To prevent escape a " wire screen was
placed on top of the beakers containing snails.
