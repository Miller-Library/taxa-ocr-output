CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
During dark photoperiods the snails were kept in
complete darkness (less than 1 uW/cm2). A cloth towel
was draped over the beakers with snails, and was in turn
covered by an inverted disection tray. Before each
experiment the snails were acclimated to the beakers
for a period of 36 hours broken into 12 hours dark.
12hours light and 12 hours dark. Snails were not fed
while the experiments were in progress.
