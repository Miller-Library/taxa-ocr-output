CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
Water temperatur Dse from 21° to 28° (C). Un heated
controls were also performed. Each experimental and
control group employed 5 snails that had been in the
dark for theee days so that they would release if a
stimulus was provided. In each trial the numbers of
cercariae released per snail were ranked in decreasing
order. The Wilcoxon 2-sample rank test was used to
determine if the experimental group was releasing more
cercariae than the controls. In the first trial the
experimental was statistically different that the control
(p.95), the experimental released less cercariae!
In the second trial the control and the experimental
were not statistically different.
My colleague, John T. Warren (Warren, 1980) has
noted that large cercarial releases can be obtained
at any time if the snails are kept in dark for two days
and then exposed to bright. A 15 watt incandescent bulb
held at a distance of 15 cm will elicit this responce.
