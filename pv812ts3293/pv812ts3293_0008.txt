CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
the normal maximal period, 0830 to 1030, see Figure 3B.
Compare both phase advance experiments, 3A and 3B, to
30 which can be used as a control.
Two phase delay experiments were also done. A
phase delay involves having light onset occuring later
than expected. One delay was accomplished by lengthening
the preceding light period by four hours. The results
in Figure 4A show that fewecercariae were released
during the prime two hours, 0830 to 1030. In the next
two hours, however, while still in the dark, there was
a marked release of cercariae. When the snails were
illuminated the relaase was most pronounced. A second
phase delay was performed by lengthening the preceding
dark period by four hours. The results, Figure 4B, are
similar to the other phase delay where a marked release
occured before illumination but, the largest emergence
occured after illumination. Compare Figures 4A and 4B
to the control depicted in Figure 40. Figure 40 is
the same experiment illustrated in Figures 10 and 30.
Cercarial emergence relative to temperature
The final question that was answered asked if rising
water temperaturecould stimulate emergence. I tested this
hypothesis twice. Cne night I warmed the snails water.,
while they were in darkness, with a warm water bath.
