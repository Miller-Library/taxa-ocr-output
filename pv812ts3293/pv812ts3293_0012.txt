CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
determining cercarial emergence than the internal clock.
Although these two phase advance experiments disagree on
which is the more important in governing emergence, they
both indicate that neither is blatantly dominating the
other. Taken together the results suggest that each
factor weighs about evenly after one phase advance,
The logic employed in the theory of phase advance
experiments is the same type of logic used in phase
delay experiments, only reversed. If photostimulation
is more important than the endogenous clock one would
expect a small release at the normal time, or before
light onset, but the main release peak would be following
illumination. If the endogenous clock governs emergence
more than light one would expect the major emergence
peak to be before the delayed light onset, and a smaller
release after light onset.
Both the phase delay experiments demonstrate that
a clock is present because there am cercarial releases
before illumination began. However, botheexperiments
showed their major releases after illumination. These
results as depicted in Figures 4A and 4B indicate that
light controls cercarial emergence more than the
endogenous clock. As with the phase advance experiments,
the evidence shows that both factors are envolved in
determining the time of cercarial release.
