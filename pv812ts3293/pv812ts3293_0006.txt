CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
A similar experiment was performed where 5 snails
were exposed to natural day and night conditions.
Preceding this experiment the snails were placed in a
3 gallon plastic basin with muck and Ulva expansa, and
the water was changed daily. The snails were then left
out side for three days. The results are similar to the
preceding experiment. Most of the cercarial release
occured within the first six hour following light on set.
Water temperaturwas also checked. Figures lA and 1B
relate time and photoperiod to percent of the total
emergence and to temp√©erature, Compare 1A and 1B to 10 and 1D,
a ntural and an artificial system. It is clear that lab
results approximate the real world. Therefore I shall
concider the first two experiments to be controls for
future experiments.
Emergence during constant light and constant dark
To determineif light was the sole causal factor
governing emergence I performed two constant environment
experiments. Six snails were kept in constant dark
for 72 hours and cercariae counts were made every 12
hours. Six other snails were kept in constant light for
72 hours and cercariae were counted every 12 hours. If
light is the lone emergence stimulus one would anticipate
a large constant release during constant light. While
72 hours of constant dark should yield little cercarial
