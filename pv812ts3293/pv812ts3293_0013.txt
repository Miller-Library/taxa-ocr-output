CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
Warren (1980) observed that snails can be induced to
release cercariae at any time of day. I have personally
confirmed this observation, which coincides with the
results of my constant dark experiment. After two days
of darkness the clock breaks down and light becomes the
sole cause of emergence.
