will occur without external stimulus. This was the guiding prin-
ciple behind the constant environment experiments. The
results of the constant light and constant dark
experiments indicate that an endogenous clock is present
because the daily emergence rhythm is observed for the
first 36 hours in both constant conditions. The results
also show that light is important because the endogenous
clock breaks down without a changing photoperiod.
How much control over emergence does light have?
How much control does the endogenous clock have. These
questions can be partially answered by phase shift
experiments. If light is the more important que, one
would expect that in a phase advance experiment the
peak emergence would follow the onset of light with
a smaller peak at the normal emergence time. If the
internal clock is a more controlling factor than light
onset one would expect a smaller peak following light
onset but, the major peak would occur at the normal time.
The second set of emergence peaks on Figures 3A and
3B contain the relevant data to this argument. In
Figure 3A the largest peak is between 0830 and 1030,
the normal time. Thus the endogenous clock is more
important than photo stimulation. In the other phase
advance experiment the main emergence peak occures before
normal dawn (0830): thus light onset is more powerful in
