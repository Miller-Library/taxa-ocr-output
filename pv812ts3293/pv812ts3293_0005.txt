CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
RESULTS
Cercarial emergence relative to photoperiod
What is the que for cercarial emergence? In Bennett
Slough the two environmental factors which change the
most are temperature and light intensity. Other conditions
such as tidal height, pH, and salinity do vary from day
to day as does light and temperature. With this clue in
mind I tested the effect of light on emergence by
subjecting 25 snails to 12 hours of light followed by
12 hours of dark (LD 12:12) for three consecutive days.
Figure 20 illustrates that light and cercarial emergence
are correlated. Variation was great but for any given
24 hour period 80% of the snails would release more
cercariae in the light. There is a statistical difference
(p=.95) between the mean emergence in light and the
mean emergence in dark.
When is the maximum release relative to light onset?
This question was addressed by subjecting 10 snails to
an LD 12:12 cycle and checking for cercariae every two
hours with an additional check thirty minutes after light
onset and termination. Five of the ten snails were chosen
because they showed rhythmic releases in the previous
experiment, and five were chosen for their irregular
cercarial releases. Variation was minimal; only once did
one snail show dramatic deviance from the norm. Figures 10
and 1D relate percent of the total release to time and
temperature.
