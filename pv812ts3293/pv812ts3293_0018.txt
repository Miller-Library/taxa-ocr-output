CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
LEGENDS FOR FIGURES
Figure 1A: Water temperature (C) vs time of day for
snails depicted in 1B, those in natural conditions.
Figures 1B and 10: % of the total cercarial release ys
time. 1B is the natural conditions experiment.
1C is under lab conditions. % of total cercarial
release - total number of cercaria released during
each assay period + tetal number of cercariae
released in the entire test period. Respective
photoperiods are diagrammed below the X-axis.
Figure 1D: Water temperature (C) vs time of day for
snails depicted in 1D, those in the lab.
Figure 2A: Average number of cercariae released per
snail vs time, these 6 snails were in 72 hours of
constant dark.
Figure 2B: Average number of cercariae released per
snail vs time,
snails were in 72 hours of
constant light.
Figure 20: Average number of cercariae released per
snail vs time, these 25 snails were in LD 12:12
for 72 hours.
Figures 2A, 2B, 20: Plus and minus one standard error
are depicted with thin "I" lines.
