CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
INTRODUCTION
Many authors have shown that light, or lack of it,
causes cercariae to emerge from their host (Giovannola,
1936, Moa, etal., 1949, Glaudel, 1973, and Wagenbach,
1974). Other researchers have proposed that endogenous
rhythms govern cercarial emergence (Luttermoser, 1955.
and McClelland, 1965). In this report I shall argue
that both an endogenous clock and a sensitivity to light
govern cercarial emergence from Battilaria attramentaria.
