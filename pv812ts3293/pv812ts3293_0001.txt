CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
ABSTRACT
An undescribed species of heterophyidae cercariae
(not in Yamaguti, 1975) emergences rhythmically from
Battilaria attramentaria. Emergence occures early in
the morning. Constant light and constant dark do not
immediately alter the emergence pattern. Phase shift
experiments indicate that emergence is controlled by
an endogenous clock and a sensitivity to light.
