CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
release for the entire 72 hours. Contrary to expectation,
the rhythmic emergence pattern of the three day LD 12:12
experiment was observed for the first 36 hours of the
constant dark experiment and also for the first 48 hours
of the constant light experiment. Figures 2A and 2B
demonstrate that there is a rhythmic emergence with or
without light. This raises the possibility of an
endogenous clock because all other external stimuli
were controlled.
Emergence following phase shifts.
Thinking that an internal clock and light are both
factors influencing cercarial emergence I designed four
phase shift experiment to determine if an interaction
of the two factors existed. All four trials employed 5
snails, lasted 60 hours, and had cercariae counts made
before and after light onset. All four trials were ran
simultaneously. The first phase shift experiment
advanced dawn feur hours by shortening the preceding
light period. Figure 3A shows that the second set of
emergence peaks follow illumination. The greatest peak
occured, however, between 0830 and 1030. A second
phase advance was done by shortening the preceding dark
period by four hours. Results were similar to those of
the other phase advance experiment:  large emergence
with the onset of light and a large amergence during
