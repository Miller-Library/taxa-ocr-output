CERCARIAL EMERGENCE
Figures 2A, 2B, 26: All three are on the same time
scale, with the individual photoperiods depicted
below each X-axis.* - Sample mean is statistically
different than the control mean, pa.95. 1 = Skewed
data; 5 of the 6 snails showed similar releases but
the other snail released 20X more cercariae than
any of the other 5 snails during that assay period.
The white bar is the mean of the 5 similar releases.
Figure 3A: Phase advanced by shortening a light period.
Figure 3B: Phase advanced by shortening a dark period.
Figure 30: LD 12:12, use for comparison.
Figure 4A: Phase delayed by lengthening a light period.
Figure 4B: Phase delayed by lengthening a dark period.
Figure 40: LD 12:12, use for comparison.
Figures 3A, 3B, 30, 4A, 4B, 40: All are the average rate of
cercarial emergence vs time of day. Photoperiods
depicted below each X-axis. All six are on the same
time scale. 30 and 40 are the same graph. Average
rate of cercarial emergerce = total number of
cercariae released in an assay period number of
snails length of assay period. * - Sample mean
is statistically different than the LD 12:12 control.
1 = During that assay period one snail released 20X
more cercariae than did the other snails. Means with
the deviant datum are shaded, means without it are white.
