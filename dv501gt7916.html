An examination of the distribution of the genus
Acmaea in the intertidal revealed that the various species
have their highest population densities in different tidal
zones. One of the characteristics of these zones is a dif-
ference in their algal flora. These various intertidal
algae, which synthesize a variety of polysaccharide mate-
rials (see Peat and Turvey, 1966) constitute a potential
source of food to herbivorous scrapers such as Acmaea.

The assimilation of these materials would require a varie
carbohydrases and led to the present comparative study
of the carbohydrases present in the digestive tracts of
four species of Acmaea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The species chosen for this study were: <span style='background-color:#ffcc00' title='Acmaea : PartialExact'>Acmaea
abra</span> (Could, 1846); A.
igitalis Eschscholtz, 1833; A.
limatula Carpenter, 1864; and A. scutum Eschscholtz, 1833.
Large representatives of these species were collected from
areas of their maximum population density at Pescadero
Point, Monterey County, California.
To remove the digestive tract, the animals were
anaesthetized in isotonic magnesium chloride isotonic with
seawater, and the entire digestive tract along with associ-
ated glands (digestive gland, buccal salivary gland, and
William J. Beppi
esophageal salivary gland) excised and placed in 37 sodium
chloride in an ice bath. An enzyme extract was prepared,
containing 1 part tissue, 8 parts 36 sodium chloride, and 1
part of a saturated solution of ovomucoid (ovomucoid dis-
olved in either 0.1 Macetate buffer, ph 5.5, or 0.1 M Tris
puffer, ph 7.2). This mixture was homogenized in a tissue
grinder and then centrifuged for 30 seconds at half maximum
speed in an International Clinical Centrifuge. Ovomucoid,
prepared by the method of Fredericq and Deutch (1949), was
used as an inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes since initial
experiments indicated low carbohydrase activity, possibly
resulting from degradation of the enzymes by proteolysis.
of ovomucoid permitted detection of higher levels of
anzyme activity, and was therefore used in all reported
periments.
One ul of ensyme extract was incubated with l ml of
polysaccharide solution in 3 ml of buffer. Two buffers
were used, either 0.1 M acetate at pli 5.5,or 0.1 M Tris at
p 7.2. The polysaccharides included in this study were

using a green filter. Nwo standard glucose solutions,
1509 and 509, were run with each set of assays, and all
readings were evaluated by comparison with a glucose
standard curve. Values represent an average of two deter
minations of total reducing sugar released in the incubation
mixture, and correspond to the activity of 0.1 ml of tissue
xtract. The assay was found to be reproducible within 10
percent. The minimum value considered to be significant in
the tables was taken to be 50 ug.

onstituents of these animals, but rather an observation
of the algae available for food in the limited areas from
which the organisms were collected.
Enzyme activit
In the first experiment, the animals were "starved"
in an aquarium scraped free of algae, and kept in the dark.
After 4-6 days of starving, extracts of the gut were made,
and ensyme activity determined.
The results are recorded
in Table 1.
The results show the presence of a powerful amylase
with higher activity at ph 5.5 in all'species. An alginase
was also demonstrated in all species. All species examined

comparison of the starved animals with the non-
tarved animals shows, in general, greater activity in non

ident Although there are some deviations for particular
ubstrates, there is a general grouping in the effect of
tarvation, starvation causing a much greater decrease in
activity in Acmaea
limatula and A. scutum than in A. scabra
and A. digitalis.
Amylase activity was particularly affected.

DISCUSSION
Green and red algae, which contain starches, K-carrageenin,
and agar (Peat and Turvey, 1965), are available to all species
of Acmaea studied, and the high recorded amylase activity
correlated well with this. Brown algae, containing alginic acid,
fucoidin, and laminarin (Peat and Turvey, 1965), are available
to all species except A. scabra. Although this correlates well
with the low alginase activity found in A. scabra, it is not
reflected in the laminarinase or fucoidinase activity.
Eaton (1966) has made a careful study of the diet of A. limatula
and <span style='background-color:#fcc' title=' : NoMatch'>A. pelta.</span> A similar study of the other species would be
desireable.
The data on changes in carbohydrase activity due to starÂ¬
vation suggest that the degree of these changes is a function
of height in the intertidal zone, higher species (Acmaea scabra
and A. digitalis) showing loss drop in activity than lower species
(4. limatula and 4. scutum). Two possible reasons for this
difference are food retention time and feeding behavior. In fresh
animals, the lower species oliminated food that was only partly
digested at a much greater rate than the higher species. In
the starved animals, the remains of well-digested food were still
found in the gut of the two higher species, whereas nothing was
found in the gut of the two lower species. This difference in
food retention time correlates well with the changes in enzyme
activity during starvation.
The feeding behavior of tho higher species has also been
found to be more sporadic than that of the lower species. The
lower species, being splashed or under water a greater amount of
the tine than the higher species, are thus able to move and feed
for longer periods of time. Trus the higher species must

retain and digest food more efficiently, as was found, and are
therefore, not as susceptible to the effects of deprivation of
food.
SUMARY
The carbohydrate digestion of four limpets, Acmaea scabra,
A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. scutum was studied. The
presence of a K-carrageeninase, an agarase, a laminarinase, a
Tucoidinase, an alginase, and an amylase was demonstrated for
fods avaae
all species. Some correlation of with enzyme activity was
found. Carbohydrase levels in starved animals were compared with
levels in non-starved animals. A decrease in enzyme activity
during starvation was found, and the amount of this decrease
could be correlated with height in the intertidal, higher species
(A. scabra and A. digitalis) showing less decrease than lower
species (A. limatula and A. scutum). This correlation might be
and
related to food rotention time feeding behavior.
