Introduction
The high tidepool, with its tremendous variability
in environmental conditions over very short periods of
time, can provide a home for only the heartiest of animals.
Tidepool dwellers must contend with large daily fluctuations
in water temperature. Since such pools receive very little
splash, evaporation causes severe extremes in salinity, as
well. This paper attempts to examine light, temperature,
salinity as high tidepool parameters and show their effect
upon the behavior of one such inhabitant, <span style='background-color:grey' title='Tigriopus californicus : Fuzzy'>Tigriopus cali
fornicus.</span>
<span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus : Exact'>Tigriopus</span> is an ideal test animal for work in
behavioral studies. Approximately one millimeter in length,
this copepod is a convenient size, large enough for easy
counting with the naked eye, yet small enough so that
experimental set-ups can contain large populations to
decrease error without becoming cumbersome. The animal's
abundancy provides large numbers of individuals from the
easily accessible high tidepools.
Correlations between activity and water column
distribution will be explored. This behavior will then
be related to the possible survival strategies of the
animal. Although this paper only deals with one particular
species, one may gain insight to population behavior in
general.
Materials and Methods (Lab Studies)
Test animals at an approximate density of 1 per
2 ml. of sea water were placed in plexiglass test chambers,
approximately 13 cm. high, 18 cm. long and 5 cm. wide.
Activity was monitored using small infrared photorelays
connected to an Estraline Angus event recorder (the circuitry
by Dave Bracher). Figure 1 depicts the relay. Four relays
mounted approximately 3 cm. apart on plexiglass strips were
placed vertically in the chambers. In some experiments two
such strips of relays were placed in one chamber as seen
in Figure 2. An additional relay was placed in water devoid
of animals to check for occasional spurious counts. In
experiments run in constant darkness, photographic paper
was placed immediately behind the chamber and an electronic
strobe was flashed so that the animals cast a shadow on the
paper. Once the paper was developed, these images could be
easily resolved and the instantaneous distribution of the
animals in the water column could be determined.
Experiments were carried out in a controlled temper-
ature room. In those runs which light and temperature
were varied, the animals were placed in filtered sea water
at a salinity of 34 ppt. Light sources consisted of incan-
descent and fluorescent combinations. Glass trays filled
with water were placed in front of the lights and acted as
heat filters. In experiments which necessitated the con-
struction of a saline gradient, "Instant Ocean" was used.
The apparatus used to construct this gradient is shown in
Figure 3. A beaker partly filled with an initial salt
solution of 105 ppt. was continually mixed by means of a
magnetic stirrer. Its concentration decreased in salinity
at a fairly steady rate due to a constant inflow of distilled
water. A siphon hose from the beaker fed the test chamber
where the tubing was attached to a float. The continually
changing saline solution was thus layered in the chamber
With the higher concentrations near the bottom.
Tigriopus were collected thirty minutes prior to
each experimental run to minimize abnormal behavior brought
on by extended periods in a lab environment. The animals
were gathered during the months of April and May from a
single high tidepool at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, Cali-
fornia. This pool received very little wave action. It
was approximately 1 meter long and 1/2 meter wide, with
its depth varying between five and twelve cm. during the
two month interval. The salinity varied between 35 and 75
ppt.
It is important to note that activity counts obtained
show the number of counts per hour at a particular level in
the water column. Counts alone, however, provide no feel
for population distribution. A doubling of activity counts,
for instance, could mean that:
1. the density of animals at that particular level
increased by a factor of two,
2. the density remained constant and the animals
doubled their activity, or
3. any combination of varying density and activity took
place which would account for a two-fold increase in
the number of counts.
If the number of animals around a counter, therefore,
stays constant for a given set of conditions, then the
counter is an activity meter. Through the use of photographs,
a population distribution can be observed. Horizontal lines
were drawn through each detector in the photo and individuals
were counted 1/8 inch to each side of the lines. This is
shown in Figure 4. Each activity count for the hour prior
to the time of the photograph was then divided by its
corresponding visual count and a true activity, or activity
per individual was determined. By combining all of the
counts one can assay for overall activity.
Results and Discussion (Lab Studies)
Activity and position was monitored in constant
darkness, at 15 degrees C. and at a salinity of 34 ppt.
over a 52 hour period; the results for the top and bottom
counters are shown in Figure 5. At the top there occurred
a very high level of initial activity during the first
four hours. The diagram in Figure 6 therefore reflects
data after this initial time period. This histogram shows
the mean of the overall activity in which each bar represents
a six hour interval. A decreasing trend is observed for the
first 12 hours which then seems to remain relatively flat
for the following thirty. At this point the activity begins
to drop off slightly, perhaps due to a depleted source of
food. All further data were, therefore, taken during this
thirty hour period to assure a steady state condition.
Figure 7 describes the mean activity distribution
during the steady state interval. The bulk of the activity
consistently takes place in the top and bottom regions.
It is important to note that the relative flatness shown
during the steady state interval in figures 5, 6 and 7
indicates that any endogenous rhythm in activity, if present,
is sufficiently slight, and it can be neglected while
interpreting further results.
After 52 hours, a piece of plankton netting was used
to remove the animals from the surface to a depth of
approximately one inch. The run was then resumed; Figure 8
shows the results. The first set of bar graphs shows the
mean counts per hour at each level in the water column of
the four hours prior to the removal of the top layer of
animals. The next two depict mean values after two and
four hours respectively. At four hours the distribution
appears quite similar to that before removal. It appears,
therefore, that there are few, if any, individuals entirely
of top or bottom dwelling behavior. The vast majority seem
to be moving up and down in the water column. It is this
majority causing the distribution with which the behavioral
study deals.
Figures 9 and 10 show the activity per individual
at different levels for three different times during the
run. One observes that an animal linearly decreases its
activity as that animal nears the surface. Near the top
it may reduce its activity to a level required to overcome
the negative buoyancy of the animal. One can possibly
describe the distribution as one of orthokinesis. Since
an animal near the bottom is much more active than another
near the top, those lower in the water column are more apt
to spend less time in that region. Thus there is a higher
probability of finding a particular animal in the upper
areas.
After a baseline was established, various stimuli
were added and their effects compared. Figures 11 and 12
show the response of Tigriopus to an artificial light
cycle over a 24 hour period. These runs were made at 15
degrees C. and 34 ppt. The top histogram shows counts per
hour on top as a function of light intensity and time. As
the intensity is increased from darkness to 110 LUX, there
appears a slight increase in activity. A dramatic increase
in activity on the top then occurs upon the transition to
1600 LUX. As the intensity is further increased to 3500
LUX, however, a drop in surface activity is apparent. When
the intensity is again set to 1600 LUX, the high activity
resumes. The decreasing levels of light intensities are
then characterized by the corresponding decrease in surface
activity. The bottom histogram, showing a plot of activity
per individual, takes on the same relative shape as the
upper graph.
Light, therefore, greatly affects activity. At some
intensity around 1600 LUX there is a marked increase. If
activity in this case is directly related to actual numbers
of animals, then at this level more animals will be in the
water column, and in particular on top. This may be a
selective advantage. Perhaps the animal can readily detect
food, predators, waves, etc. at this level. This would
make the early daylight hours and the hours slightly before
dusk conducive to feeding activities. During the bright
midday, a decrease in activity would certainly help protect
the animal from predation as well as harsh conditions
brought about by exposure to direct sunlight.
The effect of temperature upon the animals' behavior
was tested and the results are shown in Figure 13. The
salinity and constant darkness conditions were maintained
as in previous baseline studies. The temperature was kept
at 5 degrees C. for four hours, then linearly increased to
23 degrees C. spanning a 24 hour period. Both activity on
the top and activity per individual, or total activity are
plotted. Again the shpaes are relatively the same. The
interesting feature is the flat region in which activity
does not vary as a function of temperature.
These findings seem to be in accord with Newell's
work (Newell, 1967 in Prosser, 1973) dealing with the
resting metabolism of four marine invertebrates. His
graphs showed a similar region where standard metabolism
was independent of temperature. The active metabolism of
Tigriopus (Fahey, 1977) appears to have a 0.10 of about 1.8
in this temperature region. The animals monitored by the
activity counter, however, were undisturbed, having a minimal
amount of activity. This would more accurately be a measure
of resting metabolism. It is interesting to notice that
the flat region in the curves do correspond to approximate
temperatures for the tidepool during the months of April
and May. This may be another selective advantage in that
the activity of a naturally occurring population of animals
may be temperature compensated.
Another experimental run compared activity to various
saline concentrations. A salinity gradient was set up in
a container, varying from a maximum of 61 ppt. at the bottom
to a minimum of 6 ppt. at the top. All other parameters
were identical to the baseline conditions. The results in
Figure 16 clearly show an activity peak around 35 ppt. one
hour after the population was introduced into the gradient.
Activity rapidly falls off to each side of this peak. A
similar shape can be seen from data at 14 hours. The curve,
however, is shifted to a much lower salinity, with the
peak centered at 18 ppt. At eighteen hours, the shape
remains the same, again peaking at about 18 ppt. with a
substantial decrease in activity.
At the three time points under observation, photo-
graphs were taken. Note the bands of high animal concen-
tration in the photo of Figure 17. Points for activity
per individual were calculated and plotted as a function
of salinity in Figure 18. (Photographic counts less than
five were not used as data points since the reliability
of the value was poor). The three-line plot clearly shows
a decrease in true activity as time increases. It is
important to note that the slope of the 1 hour and 14 hour
lines are equal. If the animals were using orthokinesis
to cluster at a given salinity, one would expect that, in
that region, the animals would be least active and that
activity would increase as the animals deviated from that
salinity. The Figure 16 data, however, contradicts this
by the low activity readings at the higher salinities.
Materials and Methods (Field Studies)
Field studies were carried out in the same high
tidepool from which test animals for the lab studies were
gathered. A sampler, depicted in Figure 17, was construc¬
ted to examine water column distribution. It consisted
of two pieces of plexiglass, approximately 1/2 meter long.
13 cm. wide and 2 cm. thick. Holes 2 cm. in diameter
were drilled in one piece with centers approximately 3cm.
apart. A sheet of plankton netting was glued to one face
of this piece.
Both plexiglass sheets were vertically placed in
the center of the tidepool. The side with holes faced
the solid sheet at a distance of about 20 cm. The drilled
piece was laterally moved toward the other until both were
flush, trapping the animals in various compartments. The
number of individuals in each was counted and an overall
water column distribution was determined. Samples were
taken under various conditions.
Results and Discussion (Field Studies)
The findings of four field samples are shown in
Figure 18. It is interesting to note the distribution
in darkness. The histogram for actual distribution is
quite similar to that for mean activity shown in Figure
7. Large differences, however, do appear in comparison
to that distribution shown in Figure 4. Discrepancies
may result in that animals on the bottom may be swept
up as the sampler is moved.
If one examines the distribution on the top,
similarities to the light experiments can be noticed.
There are the greatest number of individuals at the top
for intermediate intensity. For instance more animals
are congregated near the surface at 500 LUX than either
at darkness or 3600 LUX. Combining this with the lab
findings, one can hypothesize that at some intensit
perhaps around 1600 LUX, the increase in surface activity
correlates to an actual increase in surface density,
Summai
1. A population of <span style='background-color:#cfc' title='Tigriopus californicus : Exact'>Tigriopus californicus</span> in constant
darkness, 15 degrees C. and 34 ppt. salt water will
distribute themselves such that the majority of the
animals are at the top and the bottom. Those nearest
the bottom, with the exception of those resting on the
bottom, have a higher activity than those animals
higher in the water column.
2. The bulk of the population is somewhat homogeneous
in behavior in that there appears to be few, if any,
having distinct bottom-loving or top-loving tendencies.
The majority seems to periodically move up and down.
There seems to be some intermediate light intensity,
around 1600 LUX, causing density increases at the top
of the water column.
4.
The resting metabolism of a Tigi
riopus population over
the temperatures of a naturally occurring tidepool
seems to be temperature independent.
5. An actual preference to a salinity lower than sea
water, about 18 ppt., seems to be apparent in an
animal population.
