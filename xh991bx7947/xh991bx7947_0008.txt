factor to adjust the previous data. Radioactivity in these
rinses gave an estimation of the extent to which earlier
particle counts were biased by C DDT from the water.
Table 1 shows the corrected values for the levels of
C DDT in the water and particles. In all cases the cor-
rected figures represent minimum values for DDT concentrations.
Although the values presented here represent only
approximations, some preliminary conclusions may be drawn.
Celite and sand, both composed primarily of inorganic silichus
material, concentrate DDT to about the same degree -- greater
than 1000 times the concentration in the surrounding water.
The detritus, containing more organic material,cocentrates
DDT to an even greater extent, at least 50,000 times above
the level in the ambient water. On a volume basis also the
detritus concentrated DDT to a higher level. In this case
the detritus contained three times as much DDT as the sand.
These results indicate that the nature of the material as
well as the available surface area may be important in
determining how much DDT is eventually concentrated.
Since it had been demonstrated that particulate matter
picked up DDT to a significant extent, experiments were
designed to show that this could serve as a pathway for
the incorporation of DDT into filter feeding marine organisms.
labelled DDT was fed to the bay mussel Mytilus edulis.
Results showed that in 12 hours, the mussels had taken up a
large amount of the radioactivity that was available to them
