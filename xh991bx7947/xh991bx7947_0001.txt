Abstract
Preliminary investigations using radioactively labelled
DDT indicate that 50-90% of the DDT at a low concentration
in water is codistilled with as little as 5-20% loss of water
by evaporation over a 48 hour period. Under a constant air
flow as much as 15of this loss is recovered by water and
particulate material of a second solution placed in series.
Particulate matter in the second solution concentrates DDT
1.000 to 50,000 times the level in the ambient water, dependÂ¬
ing both on the surface area and nature of the particles.
Experiments with the bay mussel Mytilus edulis suggest that
filter feeders can readily incorporate DDT from water and
particulate matter. These results indicate that codistilla-
tion and air currents may be important in transporting
significant quantities of DDT to the marine environment where
it may enter the food chain. The variation of levels of DDT
on glassware, suspended particles and in the sea water suggests
that an equilibrium exists between the DDT adsorbed on various
materials and that found in the surrounding water.
