for similar concentrations of DDT over a 24 hour period.
After 48 hours jar 3 contained up to 15% of the DDT
removed from jar 2. This percentage representing 2-117
of the total DDT in the control, is the sum of the amounts
recovered from particles, water, and glassware of jar 3.
Late in the investigation it was discovered that the
centrifugation procedure removed a substantial amount of the
C DDT from the water. DDT thus adsorbed to the plastic
centrifuge tubes was then partially removed with the part-
icles. Consequently, DDT levels for the particles appeared
higher and levels for the water appeared lower than was
actually the case. The last run of the experiment was
designed to estimate this effect. Sand was used because
it settled without centrifugation. The water was decanted
and the particles were removed from the jar with a spatula,
placed in a scintillation vial with ethanol, and counted
directly. Although this method of collecting particles
was not entirely effective, it is believed that at least
90% of the material was recovered. After thorough mixing
the decanted water was divided into two equal portions.
One sample was extracted directly with hexane, while the
other was centrifuged before the extraction procedure, as
in previous experiments. Aliquots of both extracts were
then counted in the scintillation counter and compared.
The centrifuge tubes were then rinsed with ethanol as if
particles were being collected, to provide a correction
