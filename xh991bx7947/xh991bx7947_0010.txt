from the particles (20-50%). However, an experiment in which
C DDT detritus was incubated in unlabelled sea water
indicated a large percentage of the radioactivity from the
particles was leached into the water. Thus it cannot be
concluded definitely at this time that the uptake in Mytilus
was from the particles only. These results suggest the exist-
ence of an equilibrium between the particles and the water,
both of these serving as potential donors of DDT to the
organisms.
Implications
The experiments discussed here demonstrate the signifi-
cnace of DDT adsorption on glassware even at concentrations
below the limits of solubility. Clearly the removal of large
percentages of the added DDT from the water affects the
reliability of sample aliquots and alters the concentration
that experimental animals are actually exposed to. This is
a factor that cannot be overlooked in experiments dealing
quantitatively with DDT.
More directly, the results presented here illustrate the
extreme mobility of DDT. Although the experimental conditions
did not attempt to duplicate exactly those accuring in nature,
they demonstrate clearly that codistillation and air currents
can remove high percentages of DDT from one location and
transfer it to water and particulate matter in another. Pro-
