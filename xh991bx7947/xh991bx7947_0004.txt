slightly above the upper range of the solubil ity of DDT in
water (Bowman, Acree, Corbett 1960). Jar 3 contained no
C14 DDT.
After 48 hours the level of DDT was determined for the
system. DDT in the water of jars 1 and 2 was removed in
three extractions of 50ml reagent grade hexane. For each
extraction the separatory funnel was shaken vigorously for
one minute then left standing for ten minutes. A lml aliquot
of each hexane extract was placed in 1Oml Toluene scintillation
fluid (4gm PPO, O.lgm POPOP in toluene to make 1 liter solution)
and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Nuclear-Chicago
Unilux II) for 10 minutes. Counts from each extraction were
summed and the activity of the total water sample was calcu-
lated. This procedure had earlier been demonstrated to remove
greater than 99% of the DDT from the water. To check adsorption
on the glass, the jars were washed with 25ml hexane and a lml
aliquot was counted.
The particles in jar 3 were separated from the water by
centrifugation (about 4000x g for 10-15 minutes) and the DDT
content of both was determined. The supernatent from the
centrifugation was pipeted off and extracted with hexane
according to the same procedure used for the water in jars I
and 2. The particles were resuspended in ethanol, put in
scintillation fluid and counted. Filtration was not used to
isolate particles since C+ DDT was found to be absorbed
readily by Millipore filters.
