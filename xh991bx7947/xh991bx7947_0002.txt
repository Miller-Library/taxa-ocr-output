Introduction
Earlier studies have indicated a high codistillation
rate of DDT with water (Acree 1963). In addition, signifi-
cant levels of DDT residues have been found in the atmosphere
(Risebrough et al. 1968; Abbott et al. 1965). These results
suggest that evaporation and subsequent transport by air
currents may be important processes in the transfer of DDT
from the site of application to distant areas. Of special
interest is the possible role of these mechanisms in the
contamination of the marine environment. Further, Odem.
Woodwell, and Wurster (1969) reported high levels of DDT
on particles of organic detritus, and suggested that this
might be an important mode for the entrance of DDT into
marine animals. The preliminary studies presented here
support the hypothesis that codistillation and air currents
are important in transporting DDT to the marine environment
where it can be concentrated on particles and enter the food
chain through filter feeders.
Materials and Methods
The experimental apparatus was composed of three one-
gallon jars as shown in Figure 1. Jar 1 was sealed and
served as a control for the system. Two one-gallon jars
and two oil traps were connected in series by glass tubing
as pictured in Fig. 1. An air stream of 2-3 liters/minute
entered the otherwise sealed system from a pressurized line
