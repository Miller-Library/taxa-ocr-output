jecting these conclusions to the agricultural use of DDT
would suggest that the insecticide may readily leave the
area of application, be carried by the wind systems, and enter
the marine environment. This mechanism of transfer and
contamination has, in fact, been suspected for some time.
Finally, DDT entering sea water from the air is concentrated
in suspended organic and inorganic particulate matter. In
this way translocated DDT is made available to filter feeding
organisms and thus can enter the marine food chains, both
from being on particulate matter and from direct uptake from
the water. In conclusion, it appears that the marine ecosystem
may be serving as a receptocle for large amounts of DDT and
its residues.
