and blew across the water surface in jars 2 and 3.
After washing all jars and glass tubing with ethanol
and rinsing clean with filtered sea water, one liter of sea
water was successively filtered through O.8u, O.45u, and 0.22u
Millipore filters and added to each jar. Particles of known
weight were placed in jar 3 and kept circulated by means of
a magnetic stirer. In order to compare the affinity of DDT
for natural particles, three materials were used. Celite,
a diatomaceous earth (Johns Mansfield Co.), approximated
inorganic detritus. Organic detritus was simulated by taking
material from a phytoplakton tow, freezing it in an acetone
dry-ice bath, and drying to a powder in a 52Â°C oven. Fine
sand ranging from 0.2-0.4mm was collected in the Monterey
Marina, frozen, and dried to permit direct comparison with
the "detritus" discussed earlier. Celite and the "detritus"
were of comparable size and weight, while the inorganic
nature of both celite and sand allowed comparisons between
these materials. 20mg of particles were used in all runs
except one. In that case O.2gm sand, with a volume equal to
that of 20mg dry detritus, was used to provide a comparison
for approximately equal surface areas of the two materials.
O.lml of 14 parts per million C1+ DDT in ethanol (phenyl
ring C14 (U) 54uC/mg, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.)
was added to jars 1 and 2 making the concentrations in the
sea water of these jars equal to 1,4 parts per billion,
