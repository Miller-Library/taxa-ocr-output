Results and Discussion
The table of Fig. 1 lists the levels of the DDT in the
system after 48 hours. DDT concentrations for the water do
not include the amount adsorbed on the glassware. This
adsorption accounts for the drop from the initial concen¬
tration in the control (jar 1). Although there was much
variability in the adsorption of DDT on the glass jars, most
of the Yalues range from 10-35% of the total amount present
in the jar. This percentage remained fairly constant in
spite of changes in the actual concentrations of DDT in the
jars, indicating that an equilibrium might exist between the
DDT in the water and that adsorbed on the glass. Further
investigations are necessary to confirm the presence of
this equilibrium.
The DDT remaining in the water of jar 2 varied from
2.1 to 0.5 ppb. At the same time the volume of water re¬
maining in the jar also varied. These variations are believed
to be a result of small fluctuations in velocity and humidity
of the air flow, acting over the 48 hour period. A direct
correlation exists between evaporation of water and loss of
DDT. However, while the decrease of water was 5-207, the
DDT showed a 50-90% loss. The rate of codistillation as
defined by Acree et al. (1963) was calculated for jar 2.
The rates varied from 0.006 to 0.014 ugm/ml water and are
virtually identical to the range of rates reported by Acrée
