was measured in a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter.
using a green filter. Sterile blanks were prepared similarly,
A stock solution of DDT--obtained from the Aldrich Chemical
Co., Inc--was prepared by dissolving 1.0 gram in 100 ml. of 958
ethanol. Necessary dilutions were carried out using distilled
water in most cases. The highest final concentration of ethanol
in any of the cultures was 2.0%; no effect upon growth was noticed
at this level.
Respiration of aerobic cultures was measured manometrically
at 30'C. in Warburg flasks containing 0.036% NaHÂ»PO'H,O, 0.07%
KoHPO, and 0.5% NaCH0, as a carbon source.
RESULTS
The elective cultures developed rapidly within 24 hours
and produced a water soluble, green, flourescent pigment, charac-
teristic of members of the genus Pseudomonas. The appearance of
aerobic and anaerobic cultures was identical.
Figure 1 presents the growth of the aerobic cultures in
the presence of 0, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, and 200 ppm DDT. A lower
growth rate and less total growth was observed with increasing
concentrations of DDT. Anaerobic cultures, Fig, 2, exhibited
no growth inhibition by DDT, the growth rates and total growth
being comparable in the three concentrations used.
The measurement of growth by turbidity was made diffscult
by the turbidity of DDT at concentrations of 20 ppm and above,
The effect upon growth should therefore be confirmed by additional
