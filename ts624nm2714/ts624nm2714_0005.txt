methods of measurement.
No effect upon respiration was detected over this same
range of DDT concentrations in the aerobic cultures.
DISCUSSION
This study is only preliminary. Earlier investigations in-
dicated an effect by DDT only at much higher concentrations, e.g.
exceeding 1 per cent. DDT may affect the growth of bacteria at
much lower concentrations which are not uncommon in unsprayed areas,
e.g. 20 and 200 ppm, or .002 and .02 per cent.
The absence of any effect on anaerobic pseudomonads requires
further investigation. Wedemeyer(6) has found that Aerobacter
aerogenes can dechlorinate DDT under anaerobic conditions, but
che process is hindered greatly in the presence of oxygen.
tenersen obtained similar results with E. coli(4), and a study
by Guenzi and Beard(2) showed that C+ DDT incubated anaerobically
in soil was broken down to DDD, DDE, and other derivatives.
Whether the pseudomonads, during the process of denitrification,
are also capable of altering the structure of DDT has yet to be
determined.
SUMMARY
Growth of aerobic pseudomonads in elective cultures was
significantly inhibited by DDT in concentrations as low as 2
ppm. Anaerobic cultures showed no inhibition by DDT even at
200 ppm. No effect upon aerobic respiration was detected.
