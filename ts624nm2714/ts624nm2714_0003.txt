sodium acetate as a carbon source and either oxygen or nitrate
as a terminal electron acceptor. The use of such preparations
allowed a study of growth as well as metabolic activity, and a
more precise control of DDT concentration during experiments.
In addition, the range of concentrations of DDT used in this
study is comparable to that of the environment. In areas not
subjected to the repeated application of insecticides, residues
as high as 20 ppm have been found(7); while in orchard soils
subjected to regular application of pesticides, residues have
been reported as high as 60 ppm(5).
METHODS
The medium used elects from soil innocula organisms cor-
responding to aerobic pseudomonads and, with the addition of
nitrate, similar bacteria capable of denitrification. The
medium contained 0.036% NahpPO H2o, 0.07% KpHPOL, 0.05% Mgson.
0.005% CaclÂ», 0.005% Fecl3, and 0.5% NacH302. For aerobic
cultures 0.12 NHLCI was added to the above, the pH adjusted to
7.0; for anaerobic cultures, 0.2% KNO3 was added, the pH ad-
justed to 7.5.
Garden soil was used as an initial innoculum, and in-
cubation was carried out at 28 C.. Sub-culturing was necessary
to maintain actively growing cultures.
Growth experiments were carried out in sidearm Erlenmeyer
flasks containing the medium and DDT in concentrations ranging
from ,02 to 200 ppm. Cultures were innoculated, and turbidity
