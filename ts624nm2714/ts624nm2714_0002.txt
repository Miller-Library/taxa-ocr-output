INTRODUCTION
The widespread use of insecticides and their accumula-
tion in the environment has prompted several studies on the
effects of these pesticides on the activity of soil micro-
organisms.
Jones(3) reported no inhibition of ammonification, nitrifi-
cation, or the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds by DDT,
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenylethane), at levels between
0.O1 and 0.001 per cent. Inhibition was observed at levels of
0.1 per cent. These studies were carried out using soil samples
incubated in open containers for periods up to three years.
Similarly, he found no effect upon nitrogen fixation even at
DDT levels as high as 1.0 per cent.
A more recent study by Bartha et al.(1) indicated no in-
hibition of aerobic oxidation of glucose in soil samples con-
taining 150 parts per million DDT. Nor was an effect observed on
the process of nitrification at this concentration of DDT,
although DDE was observed to have a stimulatory effect at the
same concentration. In neither the studies of Jones nor Eartha
was an attempt made to account for the loss of DDT from the
preparations by codistillation during the lengthy incubation
periods
The present study was made using elective cultures, with
