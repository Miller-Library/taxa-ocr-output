Growth of aerobic culture of pseudomonads in the
presence of DDT, as measured by turbidity. —0—0- ho
DDT; -0—0-.02ppm DDT;-A—/-.2ppm DDT;-A—A-2ppm DDT;
++ 20ppm DDT;-E— 200ppm DDT. 100 ml. cultures
were incubated at 30 C. in sidearm flasks without
shaking; turbidity was measured in Klett-Summerson
photoelectric colorimeter.
Growth of anaerobic culture of pseudomonads in the
presence of DDT, again measured in the Klett-
Summerson colorimeter. -o-9-.02ppm DDT;-A—A 2ppm
DDT; -E— 200ppm DDT. Same conditions as for aerobi¬
cultures.
