sparse in all dishes over time, although no quantitative density studies were
performed.
A high external calcium concentration had a strong effect on the
percentage of cells that would respond to stimulation. Qualitative
observations revealed that HCM did quickly lead to cellular breakdown,
although the mechanism of cell death is unknown.
Final considerations
Several studies have demonstrated the existence of two distinct types of
mantle muscle cell. One type, which contains high levels of mitochondria
and oxidative enzymes, is roughly analogous to vertebrate slow-twitch fibers,
while the other, which contains fewer mitochondria and a greater amount of
glycolytic enzymes, is roughly analogous to vertebrate fast-twitch fibers
(Mommsen et al., 1981). Because these cell types were indistinguishable
under the microscope, a complete analysis of the data in this paper is
impossible. If cell dissociation is to be a reliable method for investigating
electrophysiology, there must be a way to unambiguously determine cell type.
Histochemistry may provide a method; for example, researchers have
differentiated the cells by staining for succinic dehydrogenase, an oxidative
enzyme that indicates mitochondrial abundance. However, this procedure
kills the cells, so it could only be used after cells were tested.
A more plausible method of differentiation may rely on the distinct
metabolic properties of the cells. The refractory period following shock could
reflect the depletion of the cellâ€™s energy store, which is replenished only
slowly. Because fast- and slow-twitch cells have drastically different metabolic
profiles, perhaps they also exhibit different recovery responses. A search for
signature refractory patterns might prove productive. Although no such
