Although the increase in contractile activation described above is
small, it was reliably seen. Switching from HCM to LCM, on the other hand,
did not produce the opposite effect of impairing contraction. For individual
cells, response curves from before and after the switch closely agree (Fig. 4).
Similarly, analysis of the population data shows no significant effect of
switching from HCM to LCM on contractile strength at any voltage (Table 1)
Analysis of threshold voltages also indicate that the switch from HCM to
LCM produced no measurable effect (Fig. 5, Table 1).
Responses to tetrodotoxin
Adding tetrodotoxin (TTX) until it reached a concentration of 200 nm
had no effect on the pattern or strength of contraction or threshold voltage in
either LCM or HCM (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Table 1). Additionally, TTX had no
apparent effect on cell survival, nor did it modify the effect of calcium on cell
survival. (Fig. 8)
Calcium and cell survival
Chronic exposure to a high calcium environment led to premature cell
death. Immediately after fibers were dissociated, typically half of the cells
would respond to electric shock, regardless of the medium. Äfter 20 hours in
HCM, few if any cells would contract. Intact cells were sparse; most of the
organic matter consisted of small, shriveled blobs. After 20 hours in LCM, by
contrast, response rate remained steady (Fig. 8), and a significant number of
cells appeared visually to be viable. Whole cells did become more scarce over
time, but a large percentage of those present still contracted. Cells have been
kept viable in LCM for up to 4 days. Attempts to culture cells at 15-17°C also
resulted in premature cell death even in LCM.
