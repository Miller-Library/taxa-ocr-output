Figure 3 THRESHOLD VOLTAGE IN CELLS SWITCHED FROM LCM TO HCM The
two cells in figure 1 were also tested for threshold voltage at a series of shock
durations. The thresholds were always lower in HCM than in LCM.
Figure 4 CONTRACTILE STRENGTH IN CELLS SWITCHED FROM HCM TO LCM
Each graph represents data from a single cell tested first in HCM and then in
LCM. The values at each voltage closely agree.
Figure 5 THRESHOLD VOLTAGE IN CELLS SWITCHED FROM HCM TO LCM The
two cells in figure 3 were also tested for threshold. The switch from HCM to
LCM had no consistent effect on threshold level.
Figure 6 TTX'S EFFECT ON CONTRACTILE STRENGTH Each graph represents data
from a single cell. The plot on the left is data taken from a cell bathed in
LCM to which TTX was added in a concentration of 200 nm. The plot on
right is from an identical experiment, except that HCM was used. The
values at each voltage closely agree.
Figure 7 TTX'S EFFECT ON THRESHOLD VOLTAGE Each graph represents data
from a single cell. The plot on the left is data taken from a cell bathed in
77
X was added in a concentration of 200 nm. The plot on
LCM to which 11.
right is from an identical experiment, except that HCM was used. The
values at each duration closely agree.
Figure 8 CALCIUM'S EFFECT ON CELL VIABILITY Cells which reacted in any way
to an 80 V shock were considered responsive, and therefore alive. Even
immediately after dissociation, only about half of the cells contracted.
