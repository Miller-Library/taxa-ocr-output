Several lines of evidence suggest that mantle muscle cells tested under
the conditions used in this study are unlikely to depolarize via a sodium
action potential. First, TTX, a potent and highly selective antagonist of the
voltage-gated sodium channels responsible for the all-or-none response in
neurons and vertebrate skeletal muscle (Costantin, 1975), had no discernible
effect on contraction. Second, twitches were usually asymmetrical, occuring
more strongly on the side closer to the electrode. This behavior is
inconsistent with the occurence of a propagated action potential, which in
such a small cell would simultaneously depolarize the entire membrane.
Third, the data in figure 1 indicate that contractile strength is smoothly graded
over a large range of stimulus strengths. The graded nature of the
contractions was most clearly seen during the low-voltage trials to determine
threshold, during which cells would barely twitch. Such gradation would not
be expected in response to an all-or-none action potential.
Unlike Nat action potentials, calcium action potentials are often
graded, such as those in the giant muscle fiber of the barnacle (Hagiwara et al.,
1968). However, the drop from 10.8 mM calcium to 1.3 mM barely affected
contraction strength or threshold voltage. Though this evidence is not
conclusive, it does indicate that contraction is not highly dependent on
external calcium concentration, as might be expected of a cell firing a calcium
action potential. The possibility exists that calcium influx through channels
is virtually saturated even at 1.3 mM Ca2+, and that calcium levels would
have to be even lower to produce an inhibiting effect. Several trials were
attempted in which the free calcium concentration was brought to very low
