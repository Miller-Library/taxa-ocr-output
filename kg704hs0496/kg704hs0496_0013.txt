analysis was performed on the data in this paper, refractory times were
observed to vary widely, ranging from several seconds to almost a minute.
Finally, morphology might also provide a means of distinguishing cell
types. In certain cells, a band of midline structures appeared in response to
stimulation, and the cells failed to respond to any subsequent shocks.
Mitochondria form a central core in some cephalopod muscle (Hochachka et
al., 1978), and this pattern has been observed in squid slow-twitch fibers
(Mommsen et al., 1981). If histochemical analysis can correlate the
appearance of this central structure to cell type, morphology alone will
provide a basis for discrimination.
Another way to improve the experimental technique is to simulate
physiological conditions more closely. A simple step in this direction would
be to determine the neurotransmitter used to produce contraction in vivo
and to use this as a stimulus in place of electric shock. Although not as easily
controllable or as minutely adjustable as electrical shock, stimulation with
neurotransmitter would yield interesting supplemental data, as well as
provide evidence that dissociated cells have retained some normal function.
