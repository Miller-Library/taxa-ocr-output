Basic responses of dissociated muscle cells
Dissociation of mantle muscle yielded muscle cell fragments mostly 30-
50 microns in length and 5-8 microns in diameter. A great deal of smaller
breakdown products, as well as some much longer cells, were also produced,
but these rarely contracted repeatedly. The proportion of these fragments
containing nuclei is unknown. Most fibers gave graded responses to electrical
stimulation, shortening slightly when shocked just above threshold, and
contracting most vigorously when shocked at 3-4 times threshold (See also
below). When the electrode was placed near the center of the long axis of the
cells, they usually contracted asymmetrically, curling toward the electrode tip
(Fig. 1). Contraction occured rapidly, usually within one video frame (33 ms),
whereas relaxation was slow, usually taking at least several seconds. Ã„fter
stimulation, each cell underwent a refractory period, during which an
additional shock brought only a diminished response, or none at all. The
length of this refractory period depended on the size of the shock, as well as
the speed of relaxation. 45 s was judged to be adequate to permit full recovery
Muscle fibers exhibited a variety of responses to stimulation. Some
cells fibrillated for as long as a minute after receiving a shock. These spasms
of activity consisted of fast, repetitive contractions and relaxations in localized
parts of the fiber. The fibrillations were almost always asymmetrical, causing
the cell to curl and uncurl. Some cells contracted fully into balls upon
stimulation and failed to relax. At other times stimulation would induce
