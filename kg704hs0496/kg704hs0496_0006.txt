swelling and the appearance of a band of central structures, presumably
mitochondria, running the length of the cell. However, no obvious
morphological differences divided the muscle fibers into distinct groups, and
the various response patterns appeared only sporadically. A graded
contraction/relaxation cycle was the most common response.
Responses to calcium
Switching from LCM to HCM caused an immediate, though small,
increase in contractile strength in response to shocks of 0.4 ms duration. In
individual cells (Fig. 2) and on the population level (Table 1), an 8-fold
increase in external calcium caused a slight boost of percent contraction, a
measure of the degree of cell shortening. Percent contraction was calculated
by determining the difference in length between the contracted and relaxed
states, and then dividing this value by the relaxed length. Results from the
two cells in figure 2 are characteristic, rising most rapidly at low voltages and
reaching a plateau at 50-60 V. Population results were analyzed by computing
the mean percent contractions at several shocks strengths (all of 0.4 ms
duration) and comparing mean values at each voltage in LCM and HCM by T-
test. HCM produces a significantly stronger response to 40 V and 60 V shocks.
The difference isnâ€™t significant at 20 V, because this stimulus is very near
threshold and many cells failed to respond.
Behavior near threshold was more carefully studied by using shocks of
various durations and determining the minimum voltage that could produce
a twitch at each duration. On the basis of results from individual cells (Fig. 3)
and from a population analysis (Table 1), switching from LCM to HCM
lowered threshold voltage at every duration. Differences in the population
means are statistically significant between LCM and HCM at every duration.
