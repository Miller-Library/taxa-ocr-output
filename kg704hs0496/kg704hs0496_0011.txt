LCM to HCM and those switched from HCM to LCM. Perhaps the fibers are
unable to maintain a high calcium gradient between the SR and the medium,
so the calcium reserves of cells in LCM are lowered, resulting in weaker
contractions. When placed in HCM, these cells actively take up calcium, and
contraction strength increases. Cells moved from HCM to LCM, on the other
hand, only lose their reserves slowly, so no effect is immediately seen. The
dependence of SR stores on external calcium concentration has also been
proposed to explain loss of contractile strength in arthropod muscle (Caputo,
1978) and in mammalian cardiac muscle (Costantin, 1975). A full analysis of
the problem would require knowledge of the rates of both calcium uptake
into the SR and eflux into the medium. However, simply tracking the
contraction strength over time of cells switched from HCM to LCM might
shed some light on the problem. And, of course, stimulating the cells in a
near-zero calcium medium buffered with EGTA would also yield useful data.
Calcium and cell death
Because a higher percentage of cells in LCM responded after 20 hrs than
after 5, figure 5 seems to indicate that LCM actually increases survivorship
over time. This effect is almost certainly an artifact caused by experimental
method. Following cell dissociation, plates were completely coated with
organic material, most of it consisting of small cellular breakdown products.
For all experiments, only cells that looked intact received shocks.
Immediately after dissociation, roughly half of the healthy-looking cells failed
to contract. After 20 hours, many of these unresponsive cells probably broke
down, leaving a higher percentage of intact cells that would actually respond.
In accordance with this theory, intact cells were observed to become more
