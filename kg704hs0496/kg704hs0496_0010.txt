respond to stimulation of just one end, possibly indicating active or
propogated spread of depolarization. Because this type of cell was rare and
this response could not be quantified, these cells werenâ€™t included in the data
analysis, but their behavior might reflect a different excitation mechanism,
involving Nat channels.
Contraction
All muscle cells must couple excitation with mechanical activity.
Calcium acts as a direct link between these stages, rising in response to
depolarization, and directly binding to the contractile machinery to allow
contraction (Hoyle, 1983). A priori, the surge in cytoplasmic calcium
concentration can be attributed to one of two sources: influx from an external
pool or release from intracellular stores. Influx works through a
straightforward mechanism. Depolarization opens voltage-sensitive
membrane channels which allow calcium to flow down an electrochemical
gradient into the cell. Release of calcium from internal stores requires a
specialized structure, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This organelle actively
sequesters calcium, helping to keep internal resting concentrations low.
Depolarization triggers release of calcium from the SR back into the
cytoplasm (Ebashi, et al., 1980). When the stimulus is removed, the SR
actively takes up calcium, thereby causing relaxation.
The relative independence of contraction strength from external
calcium concentration suggests that squid mantle muscle has internal
calcium stores. This model is lent plausibility by the fact that SR is evident in
electron micrographs of the mantle muscle of Symplectoteuthis oualaniensis
another species of squid (Moon and Hulbert, 1974). Furthermore, this model
suggests a possible explanation of the discrepancy between cells switched from
