Abstract
Muscle cells from the mantle of the squid Loligo opalescens were
dissociated and allowed to settle on plates coated with collagen. They were
bathed in either high calcium medium (HCM, 10.8 mM Ca2*) or low calcium
medium (LCM, 1.3 mM Ca2*) and stimulated with a series of electrical shocks.
The initial medium was then replaced by one with a differing calcium
concentration, and the same series of shocks was again administered. Cells
exhibited a variety of responses to shock, but the most typical was a rapid
contraction that grew stronger with increasing voltage.
Switching the cells from LCM to HCM slightly increased contraction
strength and slightly lowered the minimum voltage necessary to produce a
twitch. Switching from high calcium to low had no discernable effect on
contraction strength or threshold voltage. Likewise, the addition of
tetrodotoxin until it reached a concentration of 200 nM also had no effect,
regardless of the external calcium concentration.
External calcium concentration in the culture medium strongly
affected the cell mortality rate. Almost all cells (Â»90%) kept in HCM for 20 hrs
were completely unresponsive to electrical stimulation. By contrast, about
50% of cells kept in LCM continued to respond to stimulation even after a
period of several days.
Introduction
Little is known about the mechanism of excitation and contraction in
squid mantle muscle. Most invertebrates studied so far excite via local
membrane depolarizations or graded calcium action potentials (Junge, 1992).
