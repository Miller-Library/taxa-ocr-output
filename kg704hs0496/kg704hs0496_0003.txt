These depolarizations often directly supply the calcium influx necessary to
produce contraction. Several pieces of evidence, however, point to a different
scenario in squid mantle. Voltage clamp recordings have detected large
sodium currents in some muscle cells from the mantle of 3-month-old Loligo
opalescens (W. F. Gilly, personal communication). This finding is
particularly interesting in light of the fact that there are few examples of
vertebrate muscle that fire sodium action potentials (Schwartz and Stühmer,
1984). Furthermore, ultrastructural studies of another species of squid,
Symplectoteuthis oualaniensis, indicate the presence of a sarcoplamic
reticulum in mantle muscle cells (Moon and Hulbert, 1974), suggesting that
these fibers possess an internal calcium store and may release Ca2t from this
organelle to mediate excitation-contraction coupling. To further explore the
mechanism of excitation and contraction, the responses of dissociated mantle
muscle cells to electrical stimulation were examined under a variety of
conditions.
Materials and Methods
Experimental animal
The squid, Loligo opalescens, all between 33 and 45 days old, were
hatched and raised in the Monterey Bay Aquarium on a diet of natural
plankton and algae-enriched Artemia nauplii.
Muscle dissociation
Muscle from an entire squid mantle was first bathed in a 5 mg/ml
Sigma Type IX protease solution for 1 hour at 17°C. For LCM cells, the
protease solution was made with calcium-free artificial sea water, consisting
