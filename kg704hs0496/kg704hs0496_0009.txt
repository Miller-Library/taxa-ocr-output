levels (sub-micromolar) with EGTA, a chelating agent. However, these
experiments failed for technical reasons, and offer an obvious avenue for
future study.
Rather than the firing of action potentials, a more likely mechanism of
membrane excitation is graded local depolarization at the site of stimulation.
Such a sheme accounts for the asymmetry of the twitches. When a shock is
delivered from the point source electrode, the voltage drops rapidly across the
resistance of the medium. Therefore, the side of the muscle fiber closer to the
stimulating electrode receives the stronger shock. A model of graded, local
excitation predicts that this side would contract more strongly than the other,
causing the cell to curl toward the electrode, as was observed. The gradation
of responses seen in figures 2 and 4 also support this model.
The cells in this study were tested under nonphysiological conditions,
making speculation about their behavior in vivo difficult. As previously
mentioned, voltage clamp experiments have detected the presence of large
Nat currents in mantle muscle fibers. A complete model of cell behavior
must account for why the dissociated cells failed to show Nat spikes. It is
possible that the dissociation process interfered with the firing of action
potentials, and that the large shocks used to stimulate the cells were bypassing
the normal excitation phase of muscle contraction and instead directly
activating some internal voltage-triggered calcium release. Alternatively,
squid mantle may consist of muscle types that have various excitation
mechanisms. This experimental technique might favor the survival of those
that are excited in vivo by only the local membrane depolarizations due to
neuromuscular transmission. A small number of cells did have atypical
responses to electrical shock: contracting into blobs, twitching wildly, etc.
Often these cells were quite long (Â»150 microns), and the entire cell would
