of 470 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, at pH 7.8. For HCM cells,
the protease solution was made with filtered natural sea water. A glass
micropipette was used to tease muscle cell fragments into a 100 ul drop of the
appropriate culture medium (see below) in a 35 mm plastic culture dish.
Dishes had previously been coated with Vitrogen 100 purified collagen in .012
N HCl, which was allowed to dry completely before dishes were washed 6
times with sterile distilled water. Cells settled for 1 hour, after which 2 ml of
the appropriate medium was added to the dish.
Cells were cultured at 4°C in either a low calcium medium (LCM)
3— 3 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 49.5 mM MgCl2, added to Gibco LIE
made up of 2/7
medium at pH 7.6, or high calcium medium (HCM) containing 263 mM
Nacl, 4.6 mM KCl, 49.5 mM MgCl2, 9.5 mM CaClz, added to Gibco L15
medium at pH 7.6. Final calcium concentrations were 1.3 mM in the LCM,
and 10.8 mM in the HCM.
Electric shocks, delivered with an electrolytically sharpened tungsten
wire, were spaced 45 s apart to permit a standard recovery time that was
deemed ample. A Grass Model SD9 Stimulator was used to deliver a standard
series of shocks, which varied in voltage and duration. The stimulating
electrode was always at a positive voltage with respect to a Ag:AgCl wire in
the culture dish. During testing, cells were kept at 16-17°C.
A pasteur pipette was used to change media without disturbing the cell
being viewed under the microscope. Estimates of the efficacy of solution
transfer using a dye showed that approximately 5% of the original solution
was left behind after a change.
Cells were viewed at 400 x magnification with an inverted microscope
(Olympus IMT2) using Köhler illumination. All trials were recorded on 8
