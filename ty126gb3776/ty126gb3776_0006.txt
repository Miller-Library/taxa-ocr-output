To test whether the timing of the natural tidal cycle was a cue the limpets were
using to move, 1 exposed field limpets to an artificial high tide at an unnatural time, by
spraying them with salt water during low tide. This technique produced a level of
wetness equivalent to a degree 2 splash. To determine a movement frequency for each
spraying session, 1 simply counted the limpets that were moving after a given period of
spray and divided that number by the number I was spraying. A total of fifteen spraying
sessions occurred, divided amongst daytime and nighttime hours. The movement
frequencies of each session were averaged, and this number was compared to the
calculated field movement frequency.
Results
Frequency of movement ( times limpet movec
times limpet was "wet"), pooled over all 2660
day and night field observations was 12%. Frequency of movement, pooled over all 600
day and night lab observations, was 15%.
Frequencies of movement did not differ notably from site to site (Fig. 1). It
appears that overall differences in wave exposure do not affect limpets' tendency to
move.
For day and nighttime observations, frequency of movement in the field increased
as the degree of splash increased (Fig. 2 and 3). No degree 3 splash occurred at either
protected site during the day, so each site, splash combination was analyzed as a separate
level of a single factor ANÃ–VA (Table 3). Although the overall ANOVA was highly
significant (PS.001), no unambiguous pattern of significant differences emerged from the
post hoc SNK test (Table 3). However, there was a consistent trend of more frequent
