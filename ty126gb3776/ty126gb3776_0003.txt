Introduction
The movement behavior and foraging patterns of Macclintockia scabra have been
observed and studied for over one hundred years. All of the classic reports present a
similar story regarding the limpets' movement:
The movements of the limpets are largely controlled by the tides. When
the tide is out, they remain practically motionless on the rocks and present
no visible sign of life. With the first dash of spray from the incoming tide
they begin to move and are apparently active until the water recedes once
more" (Wells, 1917).
Macclintockia scabra find a very specific location on a rock and grow their shell to fit
that location. They establish the site as their home scar and return to rest on the scar
every time the tide is low. As described above, during the incoming high tide, the
limpets lift up their shells and begin to forage around for food - once again returning to
their home scars when the tide recedes. This movement pattern, closely correlated with
the natural tidal cycle, has been found to be invariable and all-inclusive. In an
observational study on the movement of the limpets, Willis Hewatt (1940) notes:
"After the animals had been submerged several times by the oscillating
water, they lifted their shells and started moving very slowly in various
directions. The movements began at 8:45 a.m., and by 9:00 a.m. all of the
marked limpets had moved away from their spots."
In making preliminary observations of Macclintockia scabra, living in the high-
intertidal region of the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, it was quickly apparent that rather
than foraging actively during the high tide, the majority of limpets remained motionless
