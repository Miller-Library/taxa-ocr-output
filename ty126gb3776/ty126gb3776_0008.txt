Discussion
Based on previous studies, I expected to see -100% movement frequency of
Macclintockia scabra at high tide, rather than the observed 12%. Very little literature
actually addresses the movement and feeding habits of Macclintockia scabra, but rather
focuses on the species' characteristic return to a specified home scar at low tide; perhaps
my expectation of 100% movement frequency was unreasonable. However, it is unclear
why I saw such a low movement frequency. Enright's (1977) study of vertical migration
by zooplankton suggested that under certain conditions of food availability, it might be
metabolically advantageous for herbivores to feed intermittently rather than continuously.
Little (1989) proposed a similar mechanism for benthic grazers in the rocky intertidal. If
algal films are sufficiently scarce in the high-intertidal zone, perhaps it is metabolically
beneficial for Macclintockia scabra to forage only when necessary, rather than every
tidal cycle. Foraging 12% of the time could be sufficient to meet their energetic
requirements. It would be insightful to compare the movement frequencies of the high
and mid-intertidal Macclintockia scabra and combine this information with whether there
is a significant difference in the amount of micro-algae on the rocks in both regions.
The consistency of movement at each field site suggests that location is not one of
the major factors affecting the limpets' observed movement frequency.
In comparing the movement frequencies for each degree of splash, I found
significant differences in the majority of the comparisons, regardless of site (Tables 3 and
4). Though not all differences were significant, the general trend was to see more
movement as the splash level increased.
