on their home scars. This low-level and inconsistency of movement was unexpected.
After several daytime high tide observations of-0% movement frequency, I observed the
limpets' behavior during a nighttime high tide, and was surprised to see a substantially
greater number of limpets moving. This was another unexpected discovery, as previous
studies have found no significant difference in the daytime and nighttime movement
frequencies of Macclintockia scabra (Sutherland, 1969).
Tembarked on a three-week observational study, with the purpose of determining
an overall movement frequency for the limpets, as well as exploring what cues the
limpets were using to induce them to move. Did the limpets move significantly less
during the day than at night? If so, was this due to a difference in day/night tidal
conditions or were the limpets responding to the amount of light exposure they were
receiving? Did the movement frequency of the limpets vary significantly in different
locations?
Materials and Methods
1 conducted a three-week observational study of Macclintockia scabra at three
field sites, each characterized by a different degree of wave exposure. I used a variety of
brightly colored nail polish to identify limpets and their home scar location at each field
site (Table 1). I made observations of every limpet during daytime and nighttime high
and low tides. For each low tide observation, I located each limpet and checked to see
whether it had returned to its home scar or had established a new home scar location. For
each high tide observation, I categorized the degree of splash (Table 2) each limpet was
receiving and noted which limpets had left their home scars to forage for food. Limpets
