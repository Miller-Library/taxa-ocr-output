Abstract
Previous reports on the behavior of Macclintockia scabra have implied that the
intertidal limpet moves every time it is wetted by the incoming tide. In a three-week
study on the potential effects of location, splash and light level on limpet movement,
frequency of movement (number of instances individual limpet moved divided by the
number of instances limpet was wet - averaged over all observed limpets) was calculated
to be 12%. This is based on 2660 field observations on seventy-nine limpets, dispersed
among three sites, differing in degree of wave exposure. I also made 600 observations on
twenty-five limpets that had established home scars on rocks transported to the
laboratory. Frequency of movement in the lab was 15%. A two-factor analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was carried out on frequency of movement, with degree of splash
and field site as the two factors. Data from during the day, and at night had to be
analyzed separately because all possible combinations of "splash", "site" and "light
level" did not occur during my field study. Frequency of movement did not differ
significantly among sites. No movement was observed at low tide in either the lab or
field. An increased frequency of movement was found to accompany a corresponding
increase in splash level, both at night and during the day. However, lab results showed a
decreased frequency of movement when limpets were submerged rather than sprinkled by
a spray bar. A significantly greater amount of movement (25%) was seen at night than
during the day (7%) - a finding that could be due to the higher nighttime tidal heights.
Lab results showed no significant difference in day and night movement frequency. In a
separate experiment, limpets were exposed to an artificial high tide, during a normally
low tidal period. The limpets responded by producing a significantly lower-than-normal
