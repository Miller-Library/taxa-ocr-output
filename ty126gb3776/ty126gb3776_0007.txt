movement at higher degrees of splash during the day (Fig. 2, Table 3). Maximum
daytime movement was 29% at the exposed site with splash level 3 (Fig. 2).
At night, movement was significantly greater at each increasing level of splash
within each site (with one exception - see Table 4 and Fig. 3). The maximum frequency
of movement 1 observed in the entire study was 41% at protected site 2, with splash level
3, at night (Fig. 3).
In the lab, frequency of movement showed the opposite trend from the field data,
with decreasing movement as the degree of splash increased for both day and nighttime
observations (Fig. 4 and 5).
The frequency of movement of field limpets was 8% when exposed to an
artificial degree 2 splash. Of fifteen spraying sessions, ten resulted in no movement at all
(Fig. 6).
Frequency of movement in the field was significantly greater at night than during
the day, pooled over all levels of splash and sites (Table 6). Although no statistical
comparisons could be made, frequency of movement for each degree of splash was
consistently higher for the nighttime field observations than the day (Fig. 7). Frequency
of movement was also greater at each field site during the night than during the day (Fig,
8). In the lab, limpets also moved more frequently at night than during the day, but these
differences were not significant (Table 5).
Although frequency of movement did not differ among sites (wave exposures), a
combination of splash and time of day appear to be the primary stimuli that induce highÂ¬
intertidal limpets to move.
