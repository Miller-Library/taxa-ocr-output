Fig. 1. Movement frequencies calculated at each field and lab site. Error bars are
standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 2. Daytime movement frequencies, calculated at each field site for each degree of
splash. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 3. Nighttime movement frequencies, calculated at each field site for each degree of
splash. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 4. Movement frequencies, based on daytime lab observations, calculated for each
degree of splash. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 5. Movement frequencies, based on nighttime lab observations, calculated for each
degree of splash. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 6. Number of instances a given movement frequency was observed, when limpets
were exposed to an artificial degree 2 splash high tide, at an unnatural time.
Fig. 7. A comparison of daytime and nighttime movement frequencies, calculated at each
degree of splash pooled over all field sites. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 8. A comparison of daytime and nighttime movement frequencies, calculated at each
site, pooled over all levels of splash. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
