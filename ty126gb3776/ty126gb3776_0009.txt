The difference in lab results is perplexing (Fig. 4 and 5), as both daytime and
nighttime movement frequencies were lower for a splash 3 than a splash 2 high tide.
Perhaps lab splash simulations did not mimic sufficiently the field splash 2 and 3
conditions. For example, the lab splash 3 was a gentle, gradual submergence of the
limpets and rocks, while a field splash 3 consisted of more wavy, variable conditions. If I
could replicate and categorize the lab and field degrees of splash more closely, perhaps I
would obtain more consistent results.
It would not be valid to conclude that the limpets possess an internal tidal timing
factor (endogenous clock?), based on the spraying data alone. A series of more
convincing isolation studies would need to occur in order to legitimately approach this
subject. However, because the limpets responded to the spraying with an appreciably
lower frequency of movement than that seen under their natural conditions, it appears as
if they are not simply responding to the degree of splash they are being exposed to, but
the timing of the splash as well. This topic bears further investigation.
Because the field movement frequency, observed during the day, was
significantly less than the nighttime field movement frequency (Table 6), it appears as if
limpets use the amount of light they are exposed to as a movement cue. This difference
was significant when pooled over all splash level and site combinations. Once again, it is
perplexing why there was no significant difference between day and night movement in
the lab (Table 5). Perhaps the artificial conditions caused the lab limpets to behave in an
unnatural manner.
Because no nighttime low high tide and daytime high high tide occurred during
my observational period, it is difficult to infer whether the limpets are responding to a
