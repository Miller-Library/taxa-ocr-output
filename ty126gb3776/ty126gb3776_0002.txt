frequency of movement (8%). 10/15 tidal simulations resulted in a movement frequency
of zero. My findings suggest that Macclintockia scabra may use a combination of splash
level, light, and other as yet identified "tidal-timing" cues to induce movement. Location
appears to play a less significant role.
