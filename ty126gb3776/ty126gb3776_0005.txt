were considered wetted at splash 1 category or above. I calculated a movement
frequency (E'times moved
times wetted) for each limpet and used these to tabulate overall
frequencies for each combination of splash level, site and degree of light exposure (day
or night). These were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). No degree 3
splash occurred at either of the protected sites during the day throughout the
observational period, making it impossible for me to conduct a three factor ANOVA of
the data. Instead, 1 conducted a two factor ANÖVA using splash and site as the factors
for day and night data separately, and a single factor ANOVA with degree of light
exposure (day or night) as the single factor.
In addition to my field observations, I brought granite rocks, along with twenty-
five limpets from the intertidal zone into a 250 gallon, outdoor tank. I suspended a spray
bar with running seawater over the rocks. The tank could be filled to submerge the rocks.
By controlling the extent and duration of water sprayed onto the rocks, along with the
degree to which the rocks were submerged, I could simulate artificial tides, consisting of
either degree 2 (spray, but no submergence) or degree 3 (spray combined with
submergence) splash conditions. Äfter giving the limpets a week to adjust to their
surroundings and establish home scars, day and night observations were made on the
individual limpets in a similar fashion to those in the field. For each observation, the
splash level was recorded, along with which limpets were moving. I calculated
movement frequencies for each limpet, and used these to calculate an average movement
frequency for each degree of splash, both during the day and at night. I conducted a two-
factor ANOVA on the lab data, using degree of splash and degree of light exposure (day
or night) as the two factors.
