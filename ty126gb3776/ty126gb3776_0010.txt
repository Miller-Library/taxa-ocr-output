reduced amount of light, or an increased amount of splash by moving more at night. IfI
were to continue this study, and given the chance to compare the movement frequencies
at a nighttime low high tide and a daytime high high tide, I could more readily separate
the day v. night and degree of splash effects on the limpets. However, because the
limpets did respond with a greater frequency of movement at night than during the day
over the given observational period, the possibility remains that degree of light is indeed
a movement cue utilized by the limpets.
