Temperature
The thermocouple inside the chamber showed no change in temperature
throughout each experiment, whether done in water or in air. Similarly, the thermocouple
inserted into the crab revealed that temperature remained constant. When evaporative
cooling was explored, the initial weight was 4.2340.2g, and after six hours suspension in
air, 4.7740.2g. This demonstrates no net water loss by the crabs during the experiments.
Effects of emersion
Plots of heart rate versus time (figs 1, 2) generally showed a pattern in which the
initial heart rate under immersion (i.e. the very first data point) was higher than the final
heart rate in air at the end of the experiment. 86% (30 of 36 runs) indicated decreased
heart rates in the comparison, and of the six that did not, one came from 10°C, two from
15°C, and three from 20°C. There was also consistently a great of deal of variation in
heart rate, sometimes over a 3-fold difference both within each crab and amongst crabs
overall. These trends were seen at all temperatures.
To more easily compare differences, the heart rates for each hour in air and water
were averaged (figs 3, 4), and 86% (30 of 36 runs) decreased during emersion. Of the six
crabs’ whose heart rates increased, one was from 10°C, two from 15°C, and three from
20°C. These were not the same crabs that exhibited higher rates at the end of the
experiments when the initial and final rates were compared (see above).
The average heart rate in water was divided by the average heart rate in air to
obtain percentages of overall difference (fig. 5). The percentage differences amongst
