temperature of heart rate in response to temperature is 31.5°C (Stillman and Somero,
1996).
One adaptation to emersion in response to the difficulties of respiration in P.
cinctipes is that these crabs possess a membraneous structure on the ventral merus on
each walking leg, which functions as a respiratory structure (Stillman and Somero, 1996).
What I want to investigate is how P. cinctipes are affected by alternating between
air and water in these microscale simulations of terrestrialization. Are their metabolisms
lowered? Cardiac output is a good indication of the rate of metabolism, and it has been
seen to be generally lower in terrestrial crabs relative to marine species (Burggren, 1992).
Thus, I asked if an effect of emersion in P. cinctipes could be a lowered metabolism
indicated by a decrease in heart rate.
Materials and Methods
Collection and Care
Specimens were collected during low tide from two intertidal sites, Fisherman’s
Wharf in Monterey, CA and Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA. Exposed
rocks that had crevices underneath were selected and turned over to collect crabs. The
crabs were placed into a small cooler filled with seawater and transported to Hopkins
Marine Station, where they were then placed into aquaria with flowing ambient seawater
at 13+2’C. They were kept in a rectangular Rubbermaid tupperware container
(21x13cm) that had its bottom and sidewalls cut out so that only its frame was being
used. The walls were replaced with plastic wired mesh, which allowed flow of seawater
