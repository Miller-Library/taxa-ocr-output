Fig. 1. Average heart rates versus time in a given experimental run for specimens 1 to 6
at 15°C.
Fig. 2. Average heart rates versus time in a given experimental run for specimens 7 to 12
at 15°C.
Fig. 3. Average heart rates during immersion compared to emersion for specimens 1 to 6
at 15°C. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 4. Average heart rates during immersion compared to emersion for specimens 7 to 12
at 15°C. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 5. Ratios of average heart rates during immersion divided by average heart rates
during emersion to display percent differences for specimens 1 to 12 at 15°C.
Fig. 6. Q1o values for air and water in 10°C to 15°C, and 15°C to 20°C. Error bars are
standard errors of the mean.
Fig. 7. Average heart rates in a given experimental run versus crab size for specimens 1
to 12 at 15°C and linear regression line.
