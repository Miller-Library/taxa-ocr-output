Acknowledgements
I thank Prof. George Somero for his guidance and support. He asked just the right
thought provoking questions and gave a continuous string of intellectual insights. Special
thanks to Prof. Jonathon Stillman for his time and dedication, without which this never
would have been accomplished. Likewise, the patient assistance and encouragement
from Prof. James Watanabe was invaluable. This work was supported by Hopkins Marine
Station of Stanford Uiniversity, and so I would like to recognize all of its wonderful staff,
students, and professors.
