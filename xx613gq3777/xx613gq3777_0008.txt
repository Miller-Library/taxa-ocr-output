crabs ranged from 30.69% increase in heart rate to a 38.48% decrease. When all 36
experimental runs were averaged, a net decrease of 9.22% was calculated.
Effects of size
The carapaces of the crabs ranged in width from 9mm tol6mm and averaged
13mm. Linear regression analysis comparing carapace size to heart rate showed a
significant relationship at all temperatures. For example, at 15°C, the P-value was 0.001,
and R°= 0.463 (fig. 6). To incorporate the effects of size into the analysis of the effects
of emersion on heart rate, the average of the regression lines for all three temperatures
was used to correct for size. Heart rate data were square root transformed for this
analysis. When size-corrected, the heart rate data did not show a difference between
conditions of immersion and emersion (P-0.079).
Effects of temperature
Looking for differences in temperature dependence of heart rate between
immersion and emersion, Qjos showed no differences for either 10°C to 15°C or 15°C to
20°C (fig. 7).
Discussion
It has been seen in previous studies that heart rate is directly related to
temperature in a substantial number of crustacean species (Stillman and Somero, 1996;
McGaw, 2002) This was one of the main reasons why the experiment was performed at
10°C, 15°C, and 20°C. Not only was I investigating whether or not heart rates decreased
