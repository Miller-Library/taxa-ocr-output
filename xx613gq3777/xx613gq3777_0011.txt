Conclusions
Although it has been seen that cardiac output in terrestrial crabs is generally lower
than in marine crabs, this decrease was not detected in P. cinctipes as an effect of
emersion. The natural variation in an organismâ€™s heart rate was unavoidable, and this
made comparing heart rates between immersion and emersion a challenge.
Additionally, metabolic rates in general can be strongly influenced by other innate
properties such as body size, physiological state (e.g. molting stage), and activity level
(Burggren, 1991). This makes it difficult to conclude that because a statistically
significant decrease in heart rate was not found, the metabolic rate did not decrease
either.
Instead, it has been determined that more stringent size control for the crabs is
needed to weed out some of the natural variation in heart rate, and in future studies, a
larger number of replicates should also be employed to increase the statistical power of
the experiment.
