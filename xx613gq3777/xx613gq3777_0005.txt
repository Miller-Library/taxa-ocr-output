water loss. The imitation "crab" was weighed, left suspended in air for six hours, and
then weighed again.
Preparation of crabs
Only male crabs were used. Females were not used because differences in the
brooding cycles might have complicated the results. Small numeric paper tags were
glued to the left claws of the crabs for identification. The tags did not hinder the crab's
natural mobility or ability to pinch. The widths of carapaces were measured with a
Vernier Caliper Type 6914 (Scienceware Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ). Some
crabs sustained sustained injury to their exoskeleton before the entire sequences of runs
were performed, so replacement crabs were used. SuperGlue gel was used to attach a
thin band of cork onto the back of each crab to allow metal clasps to grasp and suspend
the specimen. Shaped like a long trapezoid, the narrow end of the cork was attached to
the crab, whereas the broad and flat end was clasped. Pin-sized holes were made through
the carapace on either side of the heart and impedance electrodes made of 0.025mm
diameter ceramic-coated copper wire, whose tips had about Imm of the ceramic
insulation removed, were inserted through each opening and glued in place (Stillman and
Somero, 1996). Of each of the two sets of six crabs, number three received an additional
pin-sized hole near the previous right one, into which a thermocouple was inserted to
measure temperature inside the crab. The impedance electrode wires were connected to
an impedance converter model 2991 (UFI, Morro Bay, CA), and the heart rate was
monitored with PowerLab/16sp (AD Instruments, Pty, Ltd, Castle Hills, Australia).
