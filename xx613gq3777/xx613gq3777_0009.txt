as an effect of emersion, but also, if this were to occur, could the amount of heart rate
dependence upon temperature between air and water be different at different
temperatures? This relationship was analyzed with Qjos, and it indicated no such
difference.
Another aspect that arose due to the specimenâ€™s heart rate dependence on
temperature was whether or not temperature was absolutely controlled for throughout
each entire experimental run. If not, this could have confounded the results. As
mentioned previously, a general decreasing, albeit non-significant, trend had been seen in
heart rate as the crabs were moved from water to air, and my hypothesis would suggest
that this was due to the effects of emersion. However, one alternative hypothesis is that if
the crabs had consistently experienced even a slightly lower temperature while suspended
in air, then this could very well have been responsible for the perceived decrease in heart
rate. Hence, controlling the temperature both in air and water was vital.
There were many things that could have affected the temperature that the crabs
experienced when suspended in air. A Styrofoam lid was crafted to cover the top of the
chamber, and in this way separate to some extent the air inside from out. The cover
should also have been effective in shielding most random breezes. However, it was
devised to fit loosely over the top because sufficient airflow was needed to facilitate
oxygen circulation to prevent hypoxia. To test the efficacy of the lid in controlling
temperature, a thermocouple was immersed in water, and then left suspended in air when
low tide was simulated during the experimental runs. Because no difference was seen
between immersion and emersion, effective control of temperature by the lid was
demonstrated.
