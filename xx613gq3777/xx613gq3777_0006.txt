Data Analysis
Heart rate was monitored continuously for the duration of each experimental run
and expressed as average beats min“. Data were then averaged over ten minute intervals
and graphs against time were generated. To better compare heart rates between
immersion and emersion, the averages for each hour in air and water were calculated. To
test for a correlation between crab size and heart rate, linear regression analysis was
employed to generate regression lines for each temperature. The average of the three
regression lines was then used to correct the heart rates for effects of size. An Analysis
of Covariance was performed with the corrected data. The factors temperature and
treatment (air or water) were orthogonal to each other, and n = 12 replicates. The heart
rates were transformed into square roots before this test was performed to gain
homoskedasticity. Qjos were also calculated and compared between 10°C to 15°C and
15°C to 20°C in air versus water.
One other possible statistical test that had been considered was a Chi Square.
However, this could not be applied to a two by three model, in this case two treatments
(air or water) x three temperatures. If performed, the difference in heart rate between air
and water would have been compared within each temperature separately. This would
have necessitated three separate Chi Square tests, one for each temperature. I understood
that this would have a lower statistical power than an Analysis of Covariance. To get an
idea of what the results might have been, single factor Anovas were performed with each
temperature orthogonal to treatment, and no statistical significance was seen in any of the
three temperatures. Therefore, an Analysis of Covariance was chosen.
