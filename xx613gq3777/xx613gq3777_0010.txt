One other concern regarding the temperature that the crabs experienced in the air
was whether or not evaporative cooling was occurring. If this were the case, then the
temperature that the crabs experienced would have differed from the set air temperature.
To test for evaporative cooling, the control experimental run was performed with the fake
crab". The lack of water loss verified that evaporative cooling was not a contributing
factor. One other affirmation that evaporative cooling was not occurring was that the
thermometer inserted inside the crab also showed no signs of change when emersion
occurred. Note that although evaporative cooling was controlled for in the experimental
runs, this does not preclude that crabs do undergo evaporative cooling in their natural
environment.
There was a great deal of variation in heart rate: up to 3-fold differences were
recorded both within each crab and amongst different crabs. Variation amongst different
crabs tended to lower the power of statistical tests such as Analysis of Variance. One
way in which this was slightly corrected for was by performing instead an Analysis of
Covariance. This was only made possible by the fact that a correlation was found
between the sizes of the crabs and their heart rates. Linear regression analysis was
performed demonstrating this correlationâ€™s statistical significance, and the average of the
regression lines was used to correct for the heart rates before analyzing the data and
square root transforming it. Although this new P-value of 0.079 was considerably lower
than the one obtained from a regular Anova, it is still not statistically significantly
different.
