Introduction
An important theme in evolution is the phenomenon of terrestrialization, whereby
aquatic species developed abilities to live on land and respire in the air. The intertidal
zone is an ideal location to explore mechanisms of terrestrialization because organisms
inhabiting this habitat must be adapted to both land and water.
Potential challenges that these animals face during transition from water to land
include heat stress, desiccation, and difficulties in breathing because properties of air and
water are vastly different (Burggren and McMahon, 1981). One possible adaptation to
such stressful conditions made by marine organisms when adapting to land would be
reduced respiration as a means of reducing loss of water of the respiratory surfaces,
especially the gills. Lowering heart rate could be one mechanism for reducing the threat
of desiccation.
Arthropods have been used as model organisms for many studies of
terrestrialization (Burggren, 1992). In this experiment, intertidal porcelain crabs will be
explored. The effect of marine organisms adapting to land could be observed in the
alternating tidal cycles, where twice daily low tides simulates the process of
terrestrialization.
The intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes can be emersed during every
low tide, and spend over half its life out of water. They are found on the Northeastern
Pacific coastal shores living underneath rocks and in mussel beds at the mid intertidal
zone. P. cinctipes are also regularly subjected to large changes in temperature during
tidal cycles where, during emersion, temperatures may read 31â€™C. Their Arrhenius break
