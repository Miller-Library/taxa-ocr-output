Abstract
Intertidal organisms can spend a great deal of time out of water and must be
physiologically adapted to tolerate terrestrial conditions. I hypothesized that one of the
physiological adaptations made by intertidal organisms is reduction of metabolic rate
during the low tide period. To test this hypothesis, I investigated the ability of the
intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipe, to regulate its heart rates during the
transition from water to air. Heart beats were monitored by impedance electrodes at
10°C, 15°C, and 20°C during one hour of immersion followed by one hour of emersion.
Heart rates were recorded using a PowerLab data acquisition system and were averaged
for each 10 minute period of the experiment. Linear regression analysis was used to
determine if heart rate varied with body size using crabs with carapace width ranging
from 9mm to 16 mm. A significant decrease in heart rate with increasing body size was
found. Heart rates were corrected for body size in comparisons of the effects of
emersion. No significant effect of emersion was found (p-value of 0.079.) The
temperature dependence (Qio) of heart rate also did not differ between immersion or
emersion. In future studies, variables such as size should be more strenuously controlled
for, and this may yield clearer results.
