through the system and provided crabs with support. The crabs were allowed at least 24
hours to acclimate before use in experimentation. Crabs were fed Cyclop-Eeze (Argent
Laboratory, Redmond, WA) cultured micro-crustaceans every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday.
Experimental Materials and Design
Effects of emersion were observed at 10'C, 15Â°C, and 20'C. The crabs were
placed into an experimental chamber constructed with a rectangular Rubbermaid ice
chest (36x25cm). A refrigerated water bath (RC6 CS Lauda, Brinkmann, Germany) was
used to keep the water temperature constant inside the chamber. Styrofoam lids were
devised to loosely cover the water chamber to control the air temperature and keep the
specimens inside moist when suspended in air by metal clamps. The inside of the
chamber was lined with pipes and tubes in which anti-freeze circulated to control the
temperature of the water bath. An aquarium air stone at the bottom provided oxygen.
The chamber also contained two thermocouples calibrated to each other, one to measure
the temperature inside the chamber, and one that was inserted into the crab. Before each
run, the crabs were left undisturbed in the chamber in water for at least 15 minutes to
exclude the influence of preparation activities and stimulation. Each run consisted of six
crabs immersed in filtered seawater. Heart rate of immersed crabs was recorded for one
hour, at which time the water was siphoned out to a set level to simulate low tide. The
crabs were suspended in air for another hour. 12 crabs were used for each temperature,
making a total of 36 runs. An experimental run with a fake "crab" crafted with a sponge
whose soft side was cut into the average size of a crab was done to test for evaporative
