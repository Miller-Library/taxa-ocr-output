height ranged from -1 to +3 ft. Exposure to wave shock
ranged from slight to heavy (but see discussionâ€”Microenviron-
ment), indicating that this anemone is less fragile than
Cactosoma or Diadumine, two members of its community at Still-
water Cove. FEpiactis was found on crustose coralline algae
covered rocks and among Macrocystis holdfasts at Stillwater
Cove. At Mission Point, the anemone grows on jumbled boulders
in the mid to low intertidal, living with Tonicella lineata,
a chiton, Iridaea flaccida, and Telia coriacea. At Pescadero
Point, Epiactis was unexpectedly found on an extremely exposed
rocky ledge covered with coralline algae. Measured density
at this exposed location was 15/m2.
Telia coriacea (Cuvier, 1798)
This anemone is common at Pescadero Point and Mission
Point. At Pescadero, the anemones live in cracks, predom-
inantly on the wave sheltered side of boulders. Maximum
population density observed was 57m of crack. At Mission
Point, populaion densitjes of both Anthopleura xanthogrammica
and T. coriacea equal 1 per 4 or 5 m2 in themid intertidal
(+1 ft). As at Pescadero, anemones were located in areas
sheltered from waves.
At both study areas T. coriacea was found in shaded locations.
The shade was provided either by the dense algal cover, or
by rock (deep cracks, overhanging ledges). Often anemones
were found half buried in the gravel which had collected in
those cracks, or depressions containing anemones. Contrary
to Hand (1955), T. coriacea was also found in gravel-free areas
