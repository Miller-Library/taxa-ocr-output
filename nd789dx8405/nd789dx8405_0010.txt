at both Mission and Pesdadero Points. Vertical distribution
observed was -1 to +3 ft. tidal level.
The T. coriacea community is characterized by dense
algal cover. Among species observed in greatest abundance
are Iridaea flaccida, and Egregia menziesii. The algal cover
can be either denselj attached such as provided by Iridaea,
or sparsely attached but with abundant floating fronds (Egregia).
A single Egregia with long stipes can provide several meters
of shade to anemones in cracks. To a lesser extent, these
anemones were observed in Phyllospadix beds.
Tealia lofotensis (Danielssen, 1890)
T. lofotensis is primarily a subtidal anemone. However,
Stillwater Cove and Mission Pont each yielded one specimen
in the intertidal. Both anemones were found at the +3 ft
tide level. At Stillwater Cove, the anemone was located on
a horizontal sandstone shelf. well shaded from the sunlight.
The Mission Point anemone was also well shaded, due to its
location in a deep ++ meter) crack.
The communities for these anemones consisted of the
Anthopleura elegantissima community at Stillwater Cove and the
Mission Point Corynactis californica community. However,
due to the rare occurance of T. lufotensis in these communities,
in my study regions, I do not believe that these two communities
are truly representative of the anemone. As one observer
of the intertidal has noted, "If you look long enough, you
can find almost anything, anywhere."
