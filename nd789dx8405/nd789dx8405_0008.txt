C
at approximately 25 ft depth, indicating that the anemone
may be primarily a subtidal species.
Corynactis californica Carlgren, 1936
This anemone was found at Pescadero Point and at Mission
Point. At both locations, the preferred habitat is shaded
cracks and crevides, areas protected from wave shock and
sunlight in the low intertidal. Specimens were found also
in higher tidepools. Members of the Corynactis community
include the alga Petrocelis franciscana and, at Pescadero,
the solitary coral Balanophyllia elegans Verrill, 1864.
Diadumine lighti Hand 1955
Previously reported only at Hopkins Marine Station by
Hand, (1955), this anemone was also found at Stillwater Cove,
There, Diadumine lighti occupies the same habitat as Cactosoma
arenaria: coralline algae covered rocks and Macrocystis holdfasts.
Superficially resembling Cactosoma in appearance, the small,
(30-60 mm diameter) orange-yellow anemone may be easily dis-
tinguished from Cactosoma in the field by its slower retraction.
Hand, (1955), reports population densities of 1087m
among Gigartina spp.,holdfasts at Hopkins Marine Station.
Measured population densities at Stillwater Cove range from
.5 to 1 per mâ€™. Actual population density may be greater
than measured, due to the difficulty in spotting these small
anemones.
Epiactis prolifera Verrill, 1869
This anemone was found at all 3 study sites. Tidal
