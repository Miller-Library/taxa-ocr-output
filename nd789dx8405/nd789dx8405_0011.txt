Microenvironment
One main advantage of a field study is the opportunity
it offers to obseive interactions between members of a commÂ¬
unity. Living space is a prime factor governing population
size and distribution in the intertidal. Not all space in
thejintertidal is suitable for anemones. At Pescadero Point
the amant of exposure to wave shock governs, in many instances,
the amount of space suitable for Anthopleura elegantissima
colonization. However, the microenvironment the anemone actuall;
faces is not necessarily the environment one sees.
At Pescadero Point, A. elegantissima concentrates its
population in cracks and crevices. Rarely are any concentrations
of anemones found on flat, exposed rock surfaces. In two
instances, though, other members of the community have modified
the exposedd environment to a sheltered microenvironment that
supports anemones. Tetraclita squamosa, an acorn barnacle,
has colonized some exposed parts of Pescadero Point. Where
populations of crack-dwelling anemones abut populations of
this barnacle, limited anemone colonization of the "exposed"
areas has occurred: the anemones are interspersed with the
barnacles. By diminishing the shearing force of surge,
Tetraclite has modified the microenvironment of the anemones
settling on exposed rock faces. Here the presence of a living-
space competitor favorably modifies the environment, providing
additional room for anemone colonization.
In a similar manner, coralline algae have allowed anemones
to colonize an exposed granite slope at Pescadero. A thick
