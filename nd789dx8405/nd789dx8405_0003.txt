point, insures surf action at Pescadero Point on even calm
days.
Stillwater Cove, situated immediately south of Pescadero
Point, provides a sharp contrast to Pescadero Point. Offshore
islands, shallow water (10-fathom line approximately 600 m
offshore), and a Macrocystis bed several hundred meters thick
damp much of the wave action. The soft sandstone substrate
has suffered extensive erosion, leaving several sandstone
spits (75x20 m) in the area of study. Parts of the sandstone
spits are pock-marked with holes 1-3 cm deep by 3-4 cm diameter.
These holes are occupied by either the chiton Nuttallina
alifornica, or the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima.
A small Mytilus-Pollicipes-Tetraclita squamosa community
exists on the outermosttportions of these spits, but, in
general, waves do not sweep the sandstone even at higher
high water. Dominant algae of this community include Macrocystis
integrifolia, Ulva spp., and Porphyra perforata.
Mission Point, weat and south of Pescadero Point, combines
granite substratum With moderate exposure, thus forming a
study area intermédiate in physical characteristics between
Pescadero Point and Stillwater Cove, A dense offshore kelp
bed, moderately shallow water (10-fathom line 400 m offshore),
and the situation of the Point in the middle of a bay reduce
wave exposure. This area is additionally characterized by a
granite sand beach, sheltered tide pools, and jumbled granite
boulders forming a 40 m peninsüla. Boulders support Mytilus,
Pollicipes, and Balanus, with chitons, nudibranchs, and hermit
