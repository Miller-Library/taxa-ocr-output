found at 0.0 ft level living among Ulva
Anemones at Mission Point range from rocks imbedded in
sand at shoreline to the higher portions (+3 to 4 ft) of rocks
farther out. Their distribution here parallels their distri-
bution at Hopkins Marine Station. At Mission Point, anemones
living on shaded rock surfaces show a spacing apart of in-
dividuals (1-4 cm). Anemones on the same rock living on an
unshaded side are clumped tbgether, individuals touching each
other.
Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt, 1835)
This anemone was found at all three study sites. At
Pescadero Point and Mission Point, A.xanthogrammica lives
in the same habitat as A.elegantissima--cracks or other
areas offering some protection from wave shock, areas free of
overgrowing Iridaea flaccida-but lower in the intertidal than
A. elegantissima. At Stillwater Cove no A. xanthogrammica
were observed living in the pockmarks on vertical faces of the
sandstone spits; here A. xanthogrammica are confined to tide-
poolsgandtidal flats. None was observed in areas of Macrocystis.
Cactosoma arenaria Carlgren, 1931
This small (30-60 mm diam.) orange anemone was found only
at Stillwater Cove. A useful trait for field identification
is the very rapid retraction of tentacles, oral disc, and
upper third of column by the anemone upon disturbance. The
speed of retraction mimics that of the serpulid worm Spirobis.
