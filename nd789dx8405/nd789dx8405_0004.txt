crabs inhabiting the tide pools. Algae include Ulva spp.,
Iridaea flaccida, Egregia menziesii, and Endocladia muricata.
Methods
Anemones were studied at each study site for distribution
with respect to tidal height, abundance, community organisms,
and physical microenvironment. Identification was made
using Hand's Key to Anthozoa in Lights Manual (1975), Hand's
monograph on anemones in central California (1954), and a
paper on Cnidopus ritteri (Torrey) by Hand and Dunn (1974).
Both field and laboratory observations were made for identi-
fication of anemones, though gross physical characteristics
easily seen in the field were sufficient for most species.
No special equipment was used in performing the field studies,
other than wooden frame quadrats and meter sticks.
