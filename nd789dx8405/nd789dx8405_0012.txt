cover of articulated algae shelters A. elegantissima and
Epiactis prolifera at the -2 ft to 0.0 ft level. Though
appearing to be an area of strong wave action, actual water
shear force on the base rock had been greatly reduced by the
bed of algae. The microenvironment modification opens the
area to anemone colonization.
Nuttallina californica and Anthopleura elegantissima
At Stillwater Cove a competition for the holes in the
sandstone may exist between A. elegantissima and the chiton
Nuttallina. In areas with no anemones, the chitons occupy
holes from O.O to +4 ft. In areas with no chitons, the anemones
occupy holes from 0.O to 44 ft. In areas with both, however,
the anemones exist in a band 18-36 cm wide starting at about the
+2 ft level and extending upwards. The chitons exist in an
essentially non-overlapping band directly adjacent to and
below the band of anemones.
The presence of a straight horizontal boundaryssuggests
a border maintenance factor of some sort. Because both pop-
ulations are able to extend higher and lower when separated,
tidal height per se, appears not to be the controlling factor.
No short-term (1-3 day) aggression, or other interactions
between the two organisms were observed in the labaratory.
No interactions were observed in the field at low tide. This
border problem requires further research.
Summar
Nine anemone species were found, including two (Cnidopus
