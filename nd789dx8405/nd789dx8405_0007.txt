At Stillwater Cove,tthese anemones were found in two
habitats: on crustose and articulated coralline algae covered
rocks, and among Phyllospalix roots. Population densities
measured for the tidal range of +.5 to -1 ft were 7/m among
Phyllöspadix and 17/me on coralline covered rocks. Both
habitats are located in regions of Macrocystis holdfasts.
Other members of the Cactosoma community include the anemones
Epiactis prolifera Verrill, 1869, and Diadumine lighti Hand,
1955.
Cactosoma requires sheltered water. Areas of similar
habitat but more wave exposure at Pescadero and Mission Points
do not support populations of Cactosoma.
Cnidopus ritteri (Torrey, 1902)
This anemone was first described from a specimen taken
in Alaskan waters. Later work has shown that its range ex-
tends into Oregon and California, as far south as Shell Beach,
Sonoma County, (Hand and Dunn, 1974). This anemone was also
found at Stillwater Cove, in the -2 ft tide level. Here,
it is located among Macrocystis, attached to rock in crevices
and depressions. This habitat also contains sand, which the
anemone attaches to its column.
Cnidopus does not appear to be abundant in the intertidal
at Stillwater Cove. Only two specimens were observed in a
30 mx 30 m area. A total of five specimens were found,
and ranged in size from 4 to 6 cm expanded diameter.
A kelp bed on the southern end of Monastery Beach, south-
west of the study areas, contains larger specimens (approx¬
imately 12 cm expanded diameter) and in greater abundance,
