Abstract
The individual habitats of 9 species of sea anemones
found in 3 areas of different exposure are described. Two
species, Cnidopus ritteri (Torrey, 1902), and Diadumine li
1955, not previously reported from Monterey Peninsula,
Hand,
California are noted, along with the more commonly occurring
species, Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt,1835), Cactosoma
arenaria Carlgren, 1931, Corynactus californica Carlgren, 1936,
Epiactis prolifera Verrill, 1869, Telia coriacea (Cuvier, 1798),
Telia lof√µtensis (Danielssen, 1890). The presence of Tetraclita
squamosa and coralline algae as wave-dissipators appears to
affect the distribution of some anemones in the intertidal.
A possible competitive interaction for space between Antho-
californica, a chiton, is
pleura elegantissima and Nuttallins
described.
