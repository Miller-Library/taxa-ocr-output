Introduction
This paper examines the intertidal distribution of anem-
one species at three locations on the southern part of the
Monterey Peninsula. No previous study of this distribution
has been made in this area. Previous work by Hand (1954) fo-
cused primarily on identification and classification of anem-
ones found here and elsewhere in central California. This
study will focus on habitat discriptions for anemones found
at three locations.
Study Areas
Pescadero Point, Mission Point, and Stillwater Cove
vary widely with respect to exposure and substrate. Though
within a three mile radius, the conditions at the three sites
range from the most exposed area of the Peninsula (Pescadero
Point) to the most sheltered area (Stillwater Cove).
Pescadero Point (121°57'14"W, 36°33'16"N) is comprised of
large granite boulders directly exposed to wave and swell action.
With the 10-fathom line only 150m offshore and with no inter-
vening islands, little wave energy is dissipated before the
waves break upon the rocks. A significant feature of the
granite boulders is the abundance of weathered cracks 18-307cm
in width. Plant life consists of Egregia menziesii and
articulated corallines on the outer rock faces, with Iridaea
flaccida the dominant alga of the inner, more protected rocks.
Phyllospadix scouleri (Spermatophyta) is present in the surge
channels between the boulders. Mytilus californianus (Bivalvia)
and Pollicipes polymerus (Cirripedia) form beds on the exposed
rocks. Wave refraction, the conyerging of waves on an exposed
