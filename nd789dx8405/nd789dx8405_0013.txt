viously not reported for this area. Hand, (1954), report:
finding three additional species in this area:
lcampa decemtentaculata Hand,1954. "Garmel".
Metridium exilis Hand,1955. "Carmel Cove"
Telia crassicornis (Mueller, 1776)."As far south
as Carmel".
I was unable to find these species at my study sites.
The effects of other animal species on anemone distribution
in the intertidal are not well understood. The Nuttallina
lifornica/Anthopleura elegantissima interaction provides
a relationship future investigators may wish to utilize in the
study of biological interaction.
