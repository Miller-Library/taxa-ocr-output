Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835)
This ubiquitous anemone was found at all three study sites,
ranging from -2ft to +14 ft tidal level. The greatest vertical
range was found, as expected, at Pescadero Point where the
splash zone extends over +20 ft on days of moderate sea.
Only occasionally were these anemones found under algal
coverâ€”their most frequent location at these three sites is
unshaded by plant life.
At Pescadero Point, anemones on rocks exposed to surf
or surge inhabit cracks in rocks. Density of population
ranges from 0-30 anemones per linear meter of crack for
the most exposed cracks, to 60-120 anemones per meter for the
less exposed cracks. Areas of heavy Iridaea flaccida cover
yielded no A. elegantissima. One area of heavy articulated
coralline alga cover does support a population of small
(+1 cm diameter) anemones. This horizontal granite shelf
extendsd from -2 to 0.0 ft tidellevel and is exposed to strong
wave action. On exposed rocks, the community consists of
Mytilus californianus, Pollicipes polymerus, generally above
A. elegantissima, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, A. xanthogrammica,
Katharina tunicata among the anemones, and Haliotis cracheroddi
below A. elegantissima.
The A. elegantissima of Stillwater Cove inhabit the
holes in the sandstone and tide pools. The anemones extend
in a band 18-36 cm wide along the vertical face of a sandstone
spit, from O to 43 ft level. Other holes in the sandstone
are occupied by the chiton Nuttallina californica, and the
alga Corallina vancouveriensis. Aspects of this community
will be discussed later in this paper. Anemones were also
