t is apparent that the disposaloofssewage i
marine waters must raise the level of oxidizable or
ganic carbon in the water, but the degree to which the
elis raised, the times of maximum input, and the
sistence of the organic carbon have been unclear.
uch matters are of importance for two reasons: 1) Some
the organic carbon introduced by the sewage is in
irticulate form and invites the attachment and prolif
ration of bacteria; 2) if sewage deposits a great exc
organic carbon, there will be an increased demand or
oxygen for its oxidation and an accompanying stress
aerobic organisms. The objectives of this study have
en consonant with the above considerations. Readily
oxidizable organic carbon was measured by its abilit
to reduce dichromate
IATERTALS AND NETHOD
Oxidizable carbon was determined by the col-
imetric method described by Parsons and Strickland (1
with the following modifications. Three mls. of unfilter

15X1.5 cm. test tubes and heate

phosphoric acid in a hot water bath at
00
C for thirty minutes. Then one ml. of sulfuric aci
chromate oxidant was add
to the above,and the solution
was heated as before for an additional sixty minutes. En
tinctions were measured in a l cm. cell in a Beckman DU
at 440 mu. Oxidizable carbon was determined from a standar
curve constructed by measuring the extinctions of various
glucose concentrations. The linearity of this curve made
the following equation applicable:
grams carbon/3 mls= Ex G, where E is the mean
extinction of triplicate determinations and G is the con
stant for a given oxidant solution. In this series o
xperiments two oxidant solutions were used. For the
first of these, G-260, and for the second, G-310. In
general, G- 10 x glucose concentration which yields ar
extinction of .100. Even samples containing fine particu-
late matter gave results within that limit
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) was determined by
standard methods (2) with only a three hour incubation
eriod before titration.
namics of organic carbon and BOD were studie
as follows. The samples were well-aerated or maintaine-
under anaerobic conditions by bubbling nitrogen gas
at a similar rate. Incubation was at 14 C, the temperature
of ambient sea water
The preparations were sampled at
intervals for the organic carbon or oxygen determinations

Notice that the level of organic carbon, even in th
undiluted sewage, does not greatly exceed the level
carbon in raw sea water. Figure 1 indicates that the rate
f decomposition is fastest at the beginning of the perio
udied, and the initial decomposition rate becomes greater
as the sewage concentration increases. It is apparent from
the second figure that dichromate-oxidizable organic carbon
appears to be generated during incubation under aeration.
gure 3 compiles the data obtained when adsorption
of organic material to surfaces was controled by incubatin
ml. aliquots of sample in the same test tubes later
used for carbon analysis. Results indicate that falling
carbon levels are attributable to genuine decompositior
not simply adsorption
Changes in BOD with time were observed in sewage
iluted to 1/10 and 1/100. See Figure 4
inally, a study was made of the levels of oxidizable
arbon in sewage drawn from the Monterey facility at the
same hours on three consecutive days. Results appear in
igure 5. Apparently there is no predictable cycle
SCUSSTOI
It is important that under aerobic conditions the
vel of organic carbon detectable by dichromate reductior
is unlikely that organic carbon synthesized
scillates.
It
Co, fixation can account for this effect because the
riods of oscillation are too short to be explained or
