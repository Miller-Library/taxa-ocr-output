beach could be grouped into three categories according to tidal
height. The first clusters around the mean higher high water
line and consists of Euzonus dillonensis, Euzonus mucronata,
Eteone dilatae, and Pygospio californica, which are all sand or
particle feeders. The second group, Travisia gigas, Scoloplos
armiger, and Euzonus williamsi, extend down from the mean higher
low water line and are also sand feeders. The third group,
Nephtys californiensis and Hemipodus borealis, both predators,
ranges over the entire distance between the upper and lower
groups mentioned above.
Of the physical parameters studied only two, organic content
and water content show differences between upper and lower beach
consistent with the zonation observed. The upper group exper-
iences relatively dry conditions being mostly affected by wave
wash at higher tides, while the lower group is more often sub-
merged than not (Doty, 1946). Concerning organic content, the
data is only suggestive (Table 1), but it appears that the lower
beach contains more organic material. It has been shown (Fox.
Crane, McConnaugh, 1948) that E. mucronata needs only small
amounts of organic material absorbed on sand to meet its food
needs. This possibly accounts for its high position on the
beach in the area of less organic content. Differential needs
such as these could account for the upper and lower grouping
noted.
A more complete understanding of what is involved in this
grouping can be obtained by following the groups across the
beach from Del Monte to Sand City. The upper group, which
