L = length of core in cm, Q = volume of water collected in co,
h = length of water head in cm, A = cross sectional area of core
in cm, and t = time in seconds.
SALINITY
Salinity of interstitial water was sampled along each
transect at the four points used for sand size. Determination
was accomplished with an AO refractometer which reads salinity
directly in parts per thousand.
POPULATION SAMPLING
Samples were taken along each transect at 3 meter intervals,
starting at the berm. 1.5 meters on each side of the transect a
quarter meter cubic corer (1/64 m2) was driven into the beach and
the enclosed sand troweled into a bucket. The sample was then
wet sifted on the beach simultaneously through two screens of
mesh sizes 6 and 1 mm respectively. All organisms were collected
and returned to the laboratory for counting and identification.
In addition qualitative samplings were often taken to determine
boundaries of populations and to assure that no major polychaete
populations were overlooked.
