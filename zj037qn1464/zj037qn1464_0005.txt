All samples were then analysed for sand size by combining
each pair of surface and below surface samples and sifting
through a set of Standard Tyler screens with mesh sizes of
8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.063 mm. Cumulative per-
centages were calculated and graphed against screen size to
determine md values for each sample. Since the mdQ values
for the samples on any single transect were always very close
(e.g. at Del Monte the mean Q value was 1.16 with a standard
deviation of 0.082), they were averaged to give a single mdo
value for the entire transect.
PERMEABILITY
A constant head permeability device was used after the
methods of Means and Parcher (1971). On each transect three
samples were taken at tidal heights of approximately O, O.6,
and 1.8 meters using a PVC pipe coring device. 60 ml bottle
samples were taken from the top, middle, and bottom of this
core. In the laboratory the core was "reconstructed" by
pouring the sand into the constant head device in the same
sequence as it was collected in the field. The apparatus was
then filled with water and allowed to run for 4.3 hours, after
which large changes in permeability due to packing had ceased.
After measuring the core length and water head a quantity of
water was taken in a beaker over a period of 20 seconds and the
permeability determined by the equation:
