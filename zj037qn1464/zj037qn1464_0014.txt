DISCUSSION
The results showed a gradient of decreasing number of
species and individuals with increasing sand size and
decreasing organic content across the 4.6 km beach moving
north from Del Monte to Sand City. Several explanations for
this are possible.
Since many of the species found were typical sand feeders,
the possibility of the sand reaching sizes prohibitive to inges-
tion was considered. Euzonus dillonensis was used as an exam-
ple of a sand feeder whose distribution was sharply diminished
along the gradient and its ability to ingest sand of larger
size was tested. E. dillonensis was placed in the larger sand
from Sand City where it is not usually found. Analysis of gut
contents showed it was able to feed by selecting only the
smaller particles. This, coupled with the observation that
such sand feeding polychaetes as Scoloplos armiger and Euzonus
williamsi occupied positions on beaches of larger sand size,
pointed to the probability that factors other than sand size
caused the species limitations noted.
Factors associated with sand size such as water content
and permeability were considered next. Both show gradients that
suggest higher desiccation on the northern beaches of the study
area. Moisture is essential both in respiratory considerations
and feeding (Dales, 1963) and the problems presented by sand
that quickly loses its water may be insurmountable.
A gradient of increasing wave action caused greater beach
