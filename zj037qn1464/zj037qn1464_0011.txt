occur in dense bands 20 to 30 feet wide with a lower border
corresponding very closely to the mean higher high water line.
The members of this group are either sand or detrital feeders.
E. dillonensis has a maximum density at USNPGS with much
smaller densities on the transects to the north and south.
A closely related specie, Euzonus mucronata (Treadwell, 1914),
is found with E, dillonensis only at Del Monte. P. californica
has a maximum vertical range at the USNPGS, but is not found
at Del Monte. Moving north its density drops slightly at
Townhouse and much more severely at Holiday Inn where the
density drop is accompanied by a small downward shift in the
population to a lower tidal height. The fourth member of the
upper beach group is a Phylodocid, Eteone dilatae (Hartman,
1936) which is found on the southern two transects in low num-
bers.
The lower beach group is analogous to the upper group in
that it is composed mainly of sand feeders. Average densities
are much lower on the lower beach and in contrast to the bands
of organisms found in the upper beach, distribution is spotty,
The dominant species of the lower beach is the Orbiniid,
Scoloplos armiger (Muller, 1776) which is found from Del Monte
to Holiday Inn with a maximum density at Holiday Inn. Other
species in the lower group were Travisia gigas (Hartman, 1938),
Euzonus williamsi (Hartman, 1938), and Glycera convoluta
(Keferstein, 1882).
The only major polychaete population in the straddling
group is Nephtys californiensis (Hartman, 1938), found on the
