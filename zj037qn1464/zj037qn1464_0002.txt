INTRODUCTION
Polychaete worms have often been found to be major consti-
tuents of sandy beach communities (Eltringham, 1971). Histori-
cally, however, their distribution has been studied only in the
most general terms and very little has been learned about their
distribution on specific beaches and how this distribution
relates to environmental factors. This condition is character-
istic of the status of our present understanding of sandy beach
communities. In short, very little is known about intertidal
zonation and ecological relationships in the sand habitat as
compared to the voluminous literature available on the rocky
intertidal.
Many of the organisms of the beach live under the surface
of the sand and therefore the usual vertical gradients, so often
associated with tidal cycles and exposure in the rocky inter-
tidal, are not immediately evident here. Closer examination of
the seemingly homogeneous sandy beach reveals that indeed organ-
isms are distributed relative to tidal height and they also may
show lateral variation in response to changing physical features
along the beach.
Previous studies of polychaetes in the Monterey Bay area
(Moore, 1909; Chamberlain, 1918) have been mostly taxonomic in
nature and have provided little information concerning distri-
bution, physical environmental parameters, or the possible
relations between the two. A few studies (Rote, 1969; Clark
and Haderlie, 1962) have dealt with the biology of single species.
