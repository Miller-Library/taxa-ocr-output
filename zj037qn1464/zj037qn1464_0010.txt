water content, and settling of organic matter. The gradient of
increasing wave action in this stretch of beach brings with it
proportional increases in sand size, beach slope, and possibly
permeability, while at the same time inversely affecting the
interstitial water content and organic content of the sand.
Gradients along individual transects are probably more
affected by the tidal cycle than by wave action. The amount
of water brought in as well as the amount of time each day a
certain level is covered is dependent upon the tides. This
leads to three zones, an upper dry zone, a central zone of
change, and a low covered zone. Tidal cycles also affect
organic content in that more organic material can settle out
in the lower zones, especially in calm areas.
III. POLYCHAETE DISTRIBUTION
The vertical and lateral distributions as well as
average densities are shown in Figures 3 and 4 and Table II.
VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN RELATION TO TIDAL HEIGHT
The polychaetes found can be divided into three groups
relative to tidal height. An upper group is clustered on and
above the mean higherhigh water line (1.72 meters, Doty, 1946).
A lower group is found on and below the mean higher low water line
(+0.73 meters). A third group straddles the area inbetween
and reaches into the upper and lower groups.
The upper beach population is dominated by two species;
an Ophellid, Euzonus dillonensis (Hartman, 1938),and the
Spionid, Pygospio californica (Hartman, 1936). Both of these
