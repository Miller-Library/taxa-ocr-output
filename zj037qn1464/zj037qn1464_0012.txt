southern three transects. At these transects N. californiensis
ranges from just below mean higher high water to below mean lower
low water. At Holiday Inn and Seaside its range is restricted,
especially in its upper limits. One other polychaete, the
Glycerid Hemipodus borealis (Johnson, 1901) may also inhabit
a large portion of the straddling zone. Our data shows their
range at Sand City to be very small, but recent studies of that
beach show a much wider range (Wells, 1972). This suggests that
H. borealis may be replacing N. californiensis at the northern
two transects.
LATERAL DISTRIBUTION TRENDS
One of the most obvious trends over the range between Del
Monte and Sand City is the decrease in total number of species
from 7 to 1 as one progresses to the north. There is a drop
from 7 to 4 species between Del Monte and Holiday Inn (a dis-
tance of 2.8 km) and a drop from 4 to 1 species between Holiday
Inn and Sand City (1.8 km). The largest densities for all
polychaetes are found at USNPGS with 12.3 polychaetes per
core (a core = 1/64 m2) and at Townhouse with 5.7 polychaetes
per core. There is a smaller density at Del Monte (2.1) and
very small densities on the northern three transects (1.4,
0.7, and 0.1) (Fig. 4).
The number of species found on the upper beach decreases
steadily over the four southern transects and drops out entirely
on the two northern transects. The mid tidal range shows a single
species, N. Californiensis, in the three southern transects, but
