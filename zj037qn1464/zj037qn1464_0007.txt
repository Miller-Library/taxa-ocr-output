I. PHYSICAL FACTORS
WAVE ACTION AND SLOPE OF BEACH
A definite gradient of increasing wave action from south
to north was observed with slight wave action occuring at Del
Monte increasing to relatively heavy wave action at Sand City.
Wave size increased at a moderate rate between Del Monte and
Holiday Inn and then showed a large increase at Seaside and
Sand City. Although wave action varied greatly from day to day
over the entire area, the same general gradient was apparently
maintained.
Due to daily degradation and accumulation of sand on the
beach, the slope of each transect could not be easily determined.
However a gradient much like that seen with wave action was
observed. The beach was relatively flat at Del Monte, increas-
ing in slope toward Holiday Inn. At Holiday Inn there was a
rapid increase in beach slope corresponding very closely to the
observed rise in wave action. Although not quantified it was
noted that large areas, especially in the central portions of
the beach between mean higherhigh water and mean lower low water
were often eroded and then refilled within two days o l
PARTICLE SIZE
Particle size distribution again showed a gradient parallel
to that of wave action with sand size ranging from a median o
value of 1.16 at Del Monte to -0.06 at Sand City (Fig. 1). Sand
size increased slowly over the first three transects and then
