The area chosen for our study, Del Monte Beach, was a
stretch of beach within Monterey Bay which showed apparently
strong gradients of wave action and associated parameters.
This offered us a study area with two sets of cross gradients,
one vertical, related to tidal exposure, and the other hori-
zontal, related to geographical variations.
This investigation was designed to determine the specific
distribution of polychaete species on this stretch of sandy
beach in Monterey Bay and to try and relate this distribution
to gradients of physical factors.
