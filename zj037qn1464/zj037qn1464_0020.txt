mucronata, and Eteone dilatae) exhibit much larger numbers than
those lower beach species that live with it (Scoloplos armiger,
Travisia gigas, etc.).
Generally it is apparent that wave action is of primary
importance to the beach polychaete populations. Not only does
it control such important factors as sand size, water content,
and nutrient levels, but its physical presence seems to create
distinct grouping of species. More work is needed in this area
to isolate the individual aspects of the beach environment and
interpret their specific effect on polychaete distribution.
