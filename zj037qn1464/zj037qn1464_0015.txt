contour changes such that on the northern beaches large quantÂ¬
ities of sand could be removed in a single tidal cycle. This
factor would place most burrowing forms in danger of being
washed up into the surf. It is interesting to note that the
one species present on the most northern beach was an inter-
stitial form, the Glycerid, Hemipodus borealis.
The drop in number of species and individuals closely
parallels the drop in organic content. Since the sand and
detrital feeding polychaetes use organic material in the sand
as a nutrient source it is possible that this is the limiting
factor on the northern beaches.
The above suggestions deal with tolerances of the adult
polychaete forms, but it should be remembered that these ani-
mals have a pelagic larval stage that could be controlling the
observed distributions. Even if random oceanic input is con-
ceded this randomness is lost upon consideration of settlement.
Wilson (1952), in studying the bottom dwelling polychaete
Ophelia bicornis found them to choose a substratum appropriate
to a successful adult stage. A similar perception of sand
size, interstitial size, and organic content by beaching larvae
could keep them from settling the more rigorous northern beaches
of the study area. An even more basic consideration would be
that if the larvae act like small sand grains or bits of organic
detritus they might remain in suspension in the heavy surf on
the steeply sloped northern beaches and never settle out while
to the south the milder wave action would permit such settling.
