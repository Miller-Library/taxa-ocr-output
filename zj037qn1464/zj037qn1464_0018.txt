of the water. The upper and lower regions also represent more
stable conditions of dry or submerged states due to the oscil-
lations of the tides. It is possible that this harsh central
region creates the polarity of polychaete populations and pre-
vents a smooth continuum of species moving down the beach in
tidal height.
The species that does inhabit the central region, Nephtys
californiensis, is clearly the best swimmer and fastest bur-
rower of all the species we sampled. Dales (1963) notes its
swimming and burrowing abilities and attributes these to an
effective parapodial stroke. As the wave action increases
from Townhouse to Holiday Inn to Seaside even N. californiensis
is restricted and it moves out of the more rigorous central
beach area. Moving north from Holiday Inn a similar downward
shift is shown in the distribution of Euzonus williamsi, the
highest member of the lower group.
N. Californiensis disappears at Sand City in accordance
with Clark and Haderlies (1962) findings that Nephtys is not
found on beaches with larger (1 to 0.3 mm) sand size and heavy
wave action. It appears that another predator, Hemipodus
borealis takes over the area vacated by the N. californiensis.
Observations during the time of lower low water on beaches
with light wave activity show that N. californiensis had a
definite limit in its distribution in terms of tidal height,
Consistently over the three southern beaches the mean higher
high water line marked its upper boundary. This is possibly
due to the desiccation problems presented by the upper beach,
