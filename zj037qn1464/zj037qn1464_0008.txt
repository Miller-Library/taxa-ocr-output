rapidly increased between Townhouse and Holiday Inn. Sand size
increased moderately toward Seaside where there was a large jump
in grain size. Within each transect the sand size stayed
relatively constant between the upper and lower limits of the
beach. Most samples on any one transect showed no statistical
difference to a 95% confidence level. The greatest differences
to be found were at Seaside and Sand City but even these differ-
ences were not significant when the confidence level was dropped
to 688.
ORGANIC CONTENT
Organic content was inversely related to wave action. The
highest organic content was 409 ug Carbon/g dry sand at Del
Monte and the lowest was 202 at Seaside (Fig. 1). The biggest
change in organic content was the decrease between USNPGS and
Holiday Inn where the level dropped from 403 to 244 ug Carbon/
g dry sand. The mean organic contents exhibited a gradient
between the two extremes but due to the great randomness of
values on any one transect (Fig. 2) the variations between some
individual transects were not statistically apparent. There is
a difference between Del Monte and Seaside to a 95% significance
level using a t distribution. Using a Mann-Whitney U test with
a 90 level of significance the values from Del Monte and Holi-
day Inn are also found to be statistically different. Our
data also suggested that the organic content of the upper beach
was less than that of the lower beach (Table 1).
