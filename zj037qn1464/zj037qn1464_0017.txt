represents a large proportion of the worms on the three southern
beaches, is sharply reduced at Holiday Inn and disappears alto¬
gether at the Seaside transect (Fig. 5). This is paralleled by
a drop in water content and organic content. It is interesting
to note that there is a cross gradient present. From south to
north the water content and organic content go down, and from
upper beach to lower beach they go up. This means that for an
organism to inhabit an area of comparable moisture and nutrient
conditions as it moves in a northerly direction, it would also
have to move down to a lower tidal height. This is exactly
what is found in the positioning of the remnant of the Pygospio
californica population at Holiday Inn. The Euzonus dillonensis
population was sampled quantitatively between Townhouse and
Holiday Inn and found to decrease in numbers gradually. It
would be interesting to sample more carefully taking tidal
heights and seeing if E. dillonensis follows the same trend as
P. californica.
The middle beach group inhabits an area which is more
rigorous than the upper and lower extremes. It is more rigorous
because it is an area over which the tides rush twice a day
whereas the upper and lower beach regions are affected only
once a day, the upper at higher high water and the lower at
lower low water. This représents a stressful condition as each
tide deposits or removes sand and generally churns up the sub-
stratum (Dr. Warren Thompson, personal communication). Even
at Del Monte, the transect with smallest wave action, large
gouges were often taken out of the mid beach area by the action
