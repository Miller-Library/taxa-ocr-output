WATER CONTENT
The volume of interstitial water decreases along a vert-
ical gradient from the lower to the upper beach and along a
horizontal gradient from Del Monte to Sand City (Fig.1). Lower
water content higher on the beach is probably due to desic-
cation during low tides when these measurements were made.
This would mean that the water content would vary most in the
zone between lower high water and higher high water. Interstitial
water content decreases slowly and evenly from 18.8% water/g
dry sand to 10.3% between Del Monte and Sand City.
SALINITY
Salinity readings were taken on both interstitial and sur
face water at various levels on the beach and consistently
gave readings between 32Â°/00 and 340/00.
PERMEABILITY
Permeability measurements suggest an increasing gradient
from Del Monte to Sand City, but the high value obtained at
USNPGS and low value at Seaside are inconsistent with such an
interpretation. It is believed that the method of determination
produced conditions of packing different from those in the
natural state and this caused the apparently inconsistent results.
II. RELATIONSHIPS OF PHYSICAL GRADIENTS
The common factor associated with the demonstrated gradients
seems to be wave action. It controls sand movement and distri-
bution and slope of the beach which in turn affects permeability,
