for without such a physical limit it would only seem natural for
N. californiensis to extend upward into the rich food source pre-
sented by the upper group species. Nephtys feeds on polychaetes
in general, including other Nephtys (Clark, 1962). It is pos-
sible that at high tide the water content is sufficient for
N. Californiensis to range above this boundary.
The fact that N. californiensis and E. dillonensis popu-
lations are co-terminal poses some very interesting questions.
Differences in moisture requirements of the two species could
be causing the sharp break. Their boundary coincides with the
highest point of the beach that is completely submerged (the
mean higher high water line). But there is also the biotic
consideration. N. californiensis is a predator and E. dillon-
ensis a possible prey. Analysis of gut content of N. californ-
iensis found at the higher end of their range suggested that they
were feeding on Euzonus. As in the case of the barnacles
Chthamalus stellatus and Balanus balanoides documented by J.H.
Connell (1961) we seem to have two intertidal populations with
a sharp vertical boundary. It is possible that problems of
desiccation prohibit higher N. californiensis encroachment
while N. californiensis predation marks the lower limitof E.
dillonensis. Such suggestions could easily be tested with
appropriate analysis of N. californiensis desiccation toler-
ances and E. dillonensis distribution in the absence of N.
californiensis. It is interesting to note that the popula-
tions of sand and detritus feeders that exist in the absence
of N. californiensis (P. californica, E. dillonensis, E.
