MATERIAL AND METHODS
AREA OF STUDY
The study was conducted on a 4.6 km beach stretching north
from Municipal Wharf 2 in Monterey, California to the southern
border of Fort Ord. Six transects, approximately 900 meters
apart, were established (Fig. 1), each stretching from the berm
to the lowest point that could be reached at lower low tide
(approximately -0.3 meters). Both physical parameters and
polychaete distributions were studied at each transect at lower
low tide either on the same day or on two successive days.
ORGANIC CONTENT DETERMINATION
On each transect sand samples were taken 15 cm below the
beach surface at four equidistant locations reaching from the
berm to the waterline with the exact locations determined by the
length of the transect. The organic content was determined, in
triplicate, using the wet ashing technique of Strickland and
Parsons (1965).
SAND SIZE AND WATER CONTENT
Samples were taken on the surface and 15 cm below at four
or more locations between the berm and the waterline on each
transect. The samples were placed in tared beakers and covered.
In the laboratory the samples were weighed, dried for 24 hours
in an 80Â° oven and weighed again to constant weight. From
these figures water content of the samples was calculated as
percentage water per gram dry weight of sand. Water content
was determined only for the subsurface samples.
