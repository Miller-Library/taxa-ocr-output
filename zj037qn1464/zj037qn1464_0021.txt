FIGURE CAPTIONS
Map of southern Monterey Bay indicates location of the six
transects studied. Graphs of sand size and organic content
show mean value, standard deviation, and range of values at
each transect. Water content graph shows mean values and
ranges. Curve is plotted along mean values. Boxes show
limits of standard deviation.
Variability of sampling sites and corresponding organic
content values found on the Del Monte transect on one day.
Vertical distribution of polychaetes at the six transects.
shown in order with northernmost transect on extreme right.
Verticalscale represents tidal height in meters. Kites
show relative abundance and tidal range.
Average density of polychaetes per core (1/64 m2) for each
of the six transects, in order with northernmost on extreme
right. Lightly shaded bar represents density above mean
lower high water. Darker shaded bar across mean lower
high water. White bar below mean lower high water. Black
bar represents total average density of polychaetes on transect,
Number of species in relation to mean lower high water
(+1.3 meters). Transects shown in order with northern-
most on extreme right. Lightly shaded bar represents
number of species above mean lower high water. Darker
shaded bar across mean lower high water. White bar below
mean lower high water. Black bar represents total species
number on transect.
