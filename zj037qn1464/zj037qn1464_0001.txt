ABSTRACT
A 4.6 kilometer stretch of beach was sampled for poly-
chaete distribution. Analysis shows these beach polychaetes
to be divided into three groups with respect to tidal height.
A high group of 4 species of sand and particle feeders clus-
ters around the mean higher high water (+1.72 meters). A
parallel group of sand and particle feeders occurs on the
low beach (0.0 to +0.73 meters). A smaller group of predaÂ¬
tors spans the area from the low beach to the higher high
water line. It is suggested that the polarization into
high and low groups is caused by a central zone of substrate
disturbance and/or by differing moisture and organic contents.
The area of study contained two gradients. The first was a
vertical gradient of moisture and organic content increasing
with decreasing tidal height. The second was a lateral
gradient of increasing wave action and sand size, decreasing
organic content and water content, and decreasing species
number.
