more dilute solutions, such as would be found in sea water,
than from the more concentrated and probably unnatural
solutions used in most experiments. The reasons for this
phenomenon are unknown. It may be that the dilute solu-
tionsis more homogeneous and hence that a greater percen-
tage of the DDT in the solution is available for uptake.
It may also be that the uptake from more dilute concen-
trations occurs at a greater rate.
It is apparent that numerous aspects of this problem
remain to be studied, including ambient concentrations
in natural populations, effects of DDT on metabolism and
reproductive activities, rates of uptake lethal doses,
and the accumulation of DDT through the food chain. These
must be accompanied or preceded by studies of the ecology,
behavior, reproductive, and feeding habits of Cebedichthys,
which have not been studied to date. It is difficult
to draw conclusions concerning the uptake and effects
of DDT when such parameters remain unknown.
