the concentration factor is seen for liver tissue in the
0.015 ppb series, this is actually due to an unusually
high concentration (393.9 ppb), as compared to 87.3 and
41.6 ppb in the other two fish, in one fish of the 0.1
ppb series. The concentration factor would increase from
the 0.1 ppb series to the 0.015 ppb series if this one
value were disregarded.
DISCUSSION
The results of these experiments are in general agree-
ment with those performed on other teleosts (Holden, 1962;
Bridges et al,, 1963; Anderson and Everhart, 1966). Other
workers at the Hopkins Marine Station, using similar tech-
niques, have found closely related results in studies of
the speckled sanddab, Citharichthys stigmaeus, and the
Northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax (Phillips, 1969; Kap-
lan, 1969). Liver tissue appears to concentrate DDT to
the greatest extent, but it is possible that much of the
DDT in this organ is actually present in the blood, as
is suggested by Johnson (1962). This may also be the
case in the brain. However, as Bridges et al. (1963)
found 10.1 ppm of DDT in bullhead brain tissue as opposed
to only 2.8 ppm in muscle and 2.7 ppm in the blood, ample
amounts of blood may not be sufficient to account for
the high levels in these organs. Similarly the large amounts
of lipid in brain tissue would certainly seem to be con-
ducive to absorption of significant amounts of DDT in that
organ.
