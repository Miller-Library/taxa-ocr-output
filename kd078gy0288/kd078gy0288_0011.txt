SUMMARY
A study was performed on direct uptake and deposition
of DDT-C from sea water by the intertidal teleost Cebe-
dichthys violaceus Ayres. It was found that the liver
concentrated DDT to the greatest extent, followed by brain,
gills, and muscle. After a rapid uptake during the first
two hours of incubation, the rate was seen to decrease
to a certain extent, possibly due to removal of most of
the DDT from the water.
The ability of the fish to absorb and concentrate
DDT from concentrations comparable to those found in natural
waters was also studied, and it was found that the total
amount of DDT absorbed decreased in more dilute solutions,
but that the factor of concentration greatly increased.
The significance of direct uptake from very dilute con-
centrations is discussed.
