INTRODUCTION
That DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons are con-
centrated by freshwater fishes is well documented by nu-
merous studies (Johnson, 1968). The uptake has been shown
to occur by concentration through the food chain (Hickey
and Anderson, 1968; Woodwell, 1967), as well as by direct
uptake from environmental waters (Holden, 1962; Anderson
and Peterson, 1969). Recent studies have indicated sig.
nificant amounts of DDT in marine organisms, particularly
marine fish and birds (Risebrough et al., 1967). Although
in birds DDT is taken up through the food chain, the mech-
anism of DDT uptake by marine fishes has not been exten-
sively studied.
In order to assess the ability of marinefishes to
concentrate DDT from the environment, a study was made
of the intertidal teleost Cebedichthys violaceus Ayres,
the monkey-faced blenny eel. Rates of uptake and sites
14
of deposition were studied through the use of DDT-C
Studies were also made of the ability of the fish to take
up DDT from extremely dilute concentrations to determine
if significant amounts could be absorbed at the levels
of DDT naturally present in sea water.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens of Cebedichthys violaceus Ayres were obtained
during periods of low tide in April and May, 1969. They
were taken from the lower intertidal region, primarily
in the harbor of Monterey, California, and also off the
