the penetration of DDT. From the above considerations
liver, brain, gills, and skeletal muscle were chosen for
further analyses of uptake phenomena.
Table 1 and Figure 1 show the uptake of DDT-Ct" into
the above organs from a 1 ppb solution in sea water as a
function of time. Each point in Figure 1 is the mean of
three fish incubated for 2/3, one, two, four, and eight
hours. It is seen that in each tissue there is a very
rapid absorption during the first two hours of incubation,
followed by a decreased rate of uptake. The high amount
of DDT indicated in the brain after one hour is the result
of an extremely high reading in one fish (114.6 ppb as
compared to 47.5 and 44.7 ppb in the other two fish); this
disproportionately affected the mean uptake.
Table 2 and Figure 2 indicate the extent of uptake
by the four tissues at three different concentrations
after eight hours of incubation. Each point in Figure 2
is an average of three fish, except for the brain and gill
readings in the 0.1 ppb series, which is the average of
only two fish. In all cases the liver accumulated the
greatest amount of DDT. It is also interesting to note
that the amount of DDT in the brain and liver is much
greater than in the gills at the higher concentrations
than at the lower concentrations.
Table 3 and Figure 3 show the number of times the
DDT has been concentrated by the tissues over the concenÂ¬
tration originally present in the sea water (i.e., the
concentration factor). Although an apparent decrease in
