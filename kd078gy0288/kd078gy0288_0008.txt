been found in natural populations of many other fish, it
is probable that the saturation point of the tissues of
this fish has also not been reached. For these reasons,
it would seem that the decreased rate of uptake resulted
from the decreased availability of DDT in the sea water.
The ability of Cebedichthys to greatly concentrate
DDT directly from sea water indicates several important
points. First, it shows that DDT can enter organisms,
and so the food web, directly at many levels and can conÂ¬
tribute significantly to the overall buildup of DDT in
tissues. Thus, the amount of DDT in the animal cannot
of itself be considered a reliable indicator of trophic
level.
Second, the fact that Cebedichthys can take up sig-
nificant amounts of DDT from as low as 15 parts per trillion
(ppt) from sea water (also containing an unknown amount
of DDT dissolved in it) is ecologically significant.
Bailey and Hannum (1967) have reported concentrations of
DDT at the Golden Gate of San Francisco Bay of 20-60 ppt,
with an average of 41 ppt. The experiments I performed
show that Cebedichthys is able to concentrate DDT from
similar or more dilute solutions in a short period of time.
Thus, even the dilute concentrations found in sea water are
sufficient to permit DDT to be taken up into organisms, and
so enter the food web, where further concentration through
the food chain can occur. Since species closely related
both taxonomically and ecologically to Cebedichthys are
