made by the channels-ratio method.
RESULTS
Preliminary analyses on the extent of DDT-C uptake
were made on skin, skeletal muscle, liver, intestine,
stomach, heart, gills, brain, eye, and bladder of CebeÂ¬
dichthys. A twelve hour incubation in one part per billion
(ppb) DDT showed that liver and brain concentrated DDT
to the greatest extent, and on that basis these tissues
were chosen for further study. Although muscle did not
concentrate DDT to very high levels, it was also selected
for study as it constitutes the bulk of the animal's weight.
Entrance of DDT into the body is through the gills,
intestine, and skin. Gills were selected for further
study because levels in this organ were nearly as high
as those of brain tissue, and because there is evidence
from studies with non-feeding freshwater fish that the
gills are the primary means of entry (Holden, 1962).
Low levels were found in the stomach, but the intestine
was much higher, with concentrations approximating those
found in the gills. This may have been due to swallowed
water carrying DDT into the intestine, or to the blood
supply of this organ. Only very small amounts of DDT
were found in the skin, suggesting that absorption through
the skin contributes little to the total amount entering
the body. As the fish secretes a rather heavy mucus coat,
the constant shedding of this mucus might have limited
