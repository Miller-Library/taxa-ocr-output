the prey of predatory fish and fish-eating birds, partic-
ularly the guillemot (Carl, 1964), it might be expected
that Cebedichthys may contribute to the further concen-
tration of DDT in the higher trophic levels.
Thirdly, it is apparent that continued direct uptake
of DDT from environmental waters may result in the accumul-
ation of very high levels of DDT in tissues within rela-
tively short periods of time. For example, if sea water
contained 15 ppt DDT, the liver would concentrate to a
level of 25.5 ppb per eight hour period, or 76.5pppb per
day. At the end of one year the fish would have 27.9 ppm
of DDT in its liver. This does not include the unknown
but presumably substantial amounts of DDT which would
be accumulated as a result of feeding on contaminated
food sources. There are several hypotheses to explain
why such levels are not often found in natural populations:
attainment of lethal concentrations and thus death; sat-
uration of tissues; partial metabolism to DDE or DDD
(Bridges et al., 1963); complete metabolism and/or excre-
tion; or simply that the concentration of DDT insea water
is much less than 15 ppt, although measurements of similar
or higher levels have been made (Bailey and Hannum, 1967;
Odemar et al., 1968).
Although lesser amounts of DDT are taken up from
more dilute solutions, the concentration factor was found
to increase. This significant finding indicates that the
animals are able to concentrate DDT more efficiently from
