Uptake of DDT-C from a 1.0 ppb solution of
DDT in sea water by tissues of Cebedichthys
violaceus, as a function of time. Each point
is an average of three fish incubated for the
indicated length of time. Key: O, brain;
E, gills; A, liver; Q, muscle.
Uptake of DDT-C from 1.0, 0.1, and 0.015 ppb
solutions of DDT in sea water by tissues of
Cebedichthys violaceus, Each point is an average
of three fisn incubated for eight hours, ex-
cept for the brain and gill tissues in the
O.1 ppb series, which are the averages of two
fish. Key: B, brain; G, gills; L,liver; M,
muscle.
Factor of concentration of DDT-C by tissues
of Cebedichthys violaceus as a function of
incubation concentration. The horizontal
scale decreases from 1.0 ppb on the left to
0.O ppb on the right. Key: O, brain; m,
gills: A, liver; o, muscle.
