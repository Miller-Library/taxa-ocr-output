Point Pinos and Hopkins Marine Station beaches. The fish
were not fed during captivity, and for the most part only
fish of 7-9 cm in length were used in the experiments.
During experiments each fish was incubated in 500 ml
of sea water in a one quart capacity screw cap jar, to
which was added 0.005-0.05 ml of DDT-C.dissolved in
ethanol (specific activity: 19 mC/mM). The jars were
placed in running sea water at a temperature of 1441°C.
Controls were run under similar conditions except that
no DDT was added. No ill effects were observed in any
of the test animals, or in controls placed in twice the
volume of ethanol in sea water as the test animals. To
prevent loss of DDT from the water by evaporation or co¬
distillation (Acree et al., 1963; Wurster,1968), the jars
were kept closed.
After incubation each fish was weighed, swabbed with
95% ethanol to remove surface DDT, and sacrificed. The
brain, gills, liver (excluding gall bladder), and a sample
of skeletal muscle from the body wall were removed, placed
in tared pieces of aluminum foil, and wet weights obtained
on a Mettler H15 or HéT balance. The tissues were then
homogenized in 2.0 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Mathe-
son, Coleman and Bell) and a 1.0 ml aliquot placed in a
scintillation vial. To this was added 10.0 ml of a tol-
uene-PPO-POPOP scintillation fluid: Counts were taken for
ten minutes in a Nuclear Chicago Unilux II Liquid Scin-
tillation Counter. Background vials contained 1.0 ml DMF
