Holden (1962) in his study of uptake of DDT-C by
brown trout found that 80-90% of the DDT in the incubation
tank was removed from the water by the fish within the
first ten hours of the experiment. Attempts were made
to measure the amount of DDT remaining in the water after
the completion of the present experiments, but the results
were highly inconsistent, probably due to sampling problems.
Since DDT adheres to surfaces and codistills with water,
it might be expected to have a markedly heterogeneous
distribution (Acree et al., 1963). This would not only
affect sampling, but also change the effective concen-
tration in the immediate volume of water surrounding the
fish. Thus the fish could be concentrating DDT from water
containing much less than the amount in the original
solution.
This great reduction in the amount of DDT actually
available in the water might account for the decrease in
the rate of uptake observed in all tissues after the first
two hours of incubation. Ittis also possible that the
tissues have become partially saturated and so cannot
absorb DDT as fast as before, or that a redistribution
of DDT to other tissues begins to occur, so that the amount
in the measured tissues decreases as the level in the other
tissues increases. As regards redistribution, however,
since uptake in all tissues decreased about the same time
(two hours after the start of incubation), it would not
appear that redistribution is the factor. As regards
saturation, since much higher concentrations of DDT have
39.
