ida. Length measurements were obtained by measuring from the anterior
end to the tip of the tail; in stages IV-VI length from the anterior
tip of the carapace to posterior end was also measured. Set tion of
the appendages was recorded according to the method of Newman (1965).
It was possible to obtain naupliar instars I-IV in B. glandula and
P. polymerus, and to raise C. dalli to th√© cypris stage. B..tintinn-
abulum survived only through the third naupliar stage. The results
of the study appear in Figures 1-9 and Tables 1-4. The species studied
show differences in size and body shape, between species and also
between different stages in the same species (Fig. 1, Tables 1-4).
The setation of the antennule proved most useful in separating stages
I-V in C. dalli and at least stages I-IV of the other species (Figs.
1-4, 6-9 ). However, since setation of the antennule was the same for
of species
comparable stages of all four barnacles, identification is dependent
on tail morphology and body shape (Figs. 1, 5 ). Notable features
of the stages of the species studied are discussed below.
Stage I
Size proved to be the only distinguishing feature between the four
species. (Fig. 1, Tables 1-l).
Stage II
At this stage each species attains a characteristic shape (Fig. 1).
C. dalli is shaped much like a heart whose anterior portion is flattened.
The frontolateral horns project at right angles to the body and the
carapace does not yet appear as a separate entity. The body tapers to
a sharp point posteriorly. The tail ends in a prong-like process;
proximally it bears two sharp lateral spines (Fig. 5).
