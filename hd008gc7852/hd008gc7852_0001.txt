The Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California-
Chthamalus dalli, Balanus glandula, Balanus tintinnabulum, and
Pollicipes polymerus are common barnacles on the coast of Central Cali¬
fornia. All are intertidal species except B. tintinnabulum which lives
continually submerged. Published accounts of larval development in these
species are lacking. It was the purpose of the present study to raise
larvae of each of the species and to describe successive instars suffi¬
ciently to permit identification of each naupliar stage of each species.
Past attempts at in vitro larval cultivation have met with varying degrees of
success. Herz (1933) found eight naupliar stages and one cyprid stage in
in vitro culture of Balanus crenatus. Bassindale (1936) reared Verruca
srosemia to the cypris stage although no settling of the cypris was observed.
Costlow and Bookhout (1957, 1958) successfully raised Balanus amphitrite
denticulata amd Balanus eburneus from hatching to the cypris. Costlow
and Barnes (1961) also raised Balanus balanus to the cypris stage. Moyse
(1933) reared larvae of Balanus balanoides, Elminius modestus, Chtham-
alus stellatus and Lepas anatifera to the cypris stage. Not as suc-
cessful, Sandison (1954) raised several South African barnacle species
only to stage three nauplii. Barnes (1959) and Crisp (1961) managed to raise
3alanus nubilis and Balanus hameri, respectively, to the third naupliar stage
