Stage V
In C. dalli there is an increase in size over stage IV and
another seta appears on the dorsal side of the antennule, bringing
the number in the proximal group to three (Fig. 6).
Stage V
The transitions from stage V to stage VI involve no change in
number of setae on the antennule, and size is the simplest, though
not always definite, criterion for distinguishing between the two
stages. Compound eyes have been reported as occurring in the late
stage VI larvae by Costlow and Bookhout (1957). While developÂ¬
ment of the compound eyes was not followed in C. dalli, larvae of the
same size, both with and without compound eyes, were observed; both
are here classified as stage VI (Fig. 1).
The Cypris Darva
The cypris of C. dalli (Fig. 1 ) was raised in culture and was
observed to settle.
SUNMARY
B. glandula and P. polymerus were raised in vitro from hatching
to the fourth instar nauplius and C. dalli from hatching to settlement
of the cypris. B. tintinnabulum was raised through stage III. Cultures
were maintained at room temperature and fed on a diet of Platymonas sp.
Larval size, shape, and details of the tail and appendages are presented
for all species and all stages observed. Definite differences between
instars, and between species at the same instar, permit identification
of species and stage of development. Setation formulae, particularly
of the antennule, though of limited value for distinguishing different
