John B. Snodgrass -1
B. glandula has a shield shape with its frontolateral horns
upturned and projecting at approximately 15Â° from the body; the tail
is long and slender and also ends in a pronged process (Fig. 5).
P. polymerus is shaped like a wine goblet and its frontolateral
horns project at right angles from the body. The tail is much like
that of B. glandula except that it bears small, spiny projections (Fig.
5).
B. tintinnabulum is characterized by its large size, second only
to B. glandula, a rounded body, ahd frontolateral horns which resemble
cattle horns in their positioning. (Fig. 5).
Stage III
In all species this stage'is larger than the preceding one. A new
process appears on the dorsal side of the antennule, immediately prox-
imalto the distal group of four setae. (Figs. 2-4). This was noted
in B. hameri (Crisp, 1961) and in B. nubilis (Barnes, 1959). The tails
increase in size and become jointed above the end prongs in all four
species (Fig. 5 ).
Stage IV
At this stage in B. glandula, P. polymerus, and C. dalli the
carapace becomes markedly differentiated from the main body (Fig. 1).
Also a new process appears on the antennule to make a total of two
which are located proximal to the terminal four (Figs. 2-4, 6-9 ).
As shown in Figure 5 the tails are very characteristic for each species.
These features plus an increase in size make the fourth instar easily
distinguishable from the preceding three.
