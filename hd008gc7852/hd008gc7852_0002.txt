also.
For this study B. glandula was collected on intertidal rocks and
B. tintinnabulum from the underside of an offshore float near the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, Pacific Grove, California.
polymerus and C. dalli were obtained at Yankee Point, South of
Carmel, California. Mature ovigerous lamellae were removed from the
mantle cavity and placed in fingerbowls containing millipore filtered
seawater. The nauplii that hatched swam immediately toward the lighted
end of the fingerbowl where they were collected in a Pasteur pipette
and transferred to another fingerbowl of millipore filtered sea-
water. This fingerbowl contained Platymonas sp., a flagellate known
to provide a diet on which a våriety of barnacle larvae survive and
grow (Okamoto, 1967). Platymonas was obtained from the Hopkins Marine
Station culture collection. The larvae were cultured at room temp¬
erature (21-23° C). Three to four times daily, samples of each barnacle
species were removed and examined under a compound mocroscope. A few
additional specimens were examined from cultures of nauplii raised on
Platymonas by E. Okamoto at the Hopkins Marine Station.
Three characters which proved most useful in distinguishing
species and instars were antennule setation (Newman, 1965), body
shape, and tail morphology. Two lesser features that proved useful were
the appearance of a separate carapace at stage IV (see Crisp, 1961) in
three of the species examined, and the appearance of a compound eye in
C. dalli in stage Vl. Antennae and mandibular setation were helpful in
identifying certain instars of particular species. Äfter identification
of a particular stage, drawings were made with the aid of a camera luc¬
