habituation experiments. As a control, a second group of worms was
collected and used in experiments within two days of collection.
In preparation for an experiment worms were carefully removed
from the sand with a blunt glass rod and transferred to an adjacent
empty petri dish. The worms were allowed to remain in the empty
plate long enough to shed the mucous-substrate burrow which surrounded
them. They were then transferred to a shallow cylindrical trough made
of hardened Polyform (see diagram). The trough was then placed on the
bottom of a finger bowl, a plastic petri plate was placed over the
trough to seal it from above and the bowl was then filled with sea water
to a depth sufficient to cover the petri plate and trough. Any trapped
bubbles were then released and the glass rod of the vibrator apparatus
(see diagram) was securely clamped down over the center of the trough.
The worm was allowed to remain undisturbed until its movements indicated
the resumption of normal activity (usually 5-15 min.). Stimuli were
then delivered with a duration of 1 second (40.5 sec.) with 1 second
(40.5 sec.) intervals between stimuli. Twenty-five consecutive trials
without a visible response were chosen as the criterion of habituation.
When the criterion was reached the worm was tested (by tactile stimulation)
for possible muscular fatigue, then it was returned to its petri dish
to await retesting after a precise time interval. Following the retest,
each worm was weighed and then discarded.
To avoid possible side effects of residual mucous (McConnell, 1966)
the trough was cleansed with sulfuric acid before each run and new
sand was placed in the bottom.
