3. Retention of Habituation.
Five groups of worms were trained to criterion and then
retrained as follows:
GROUP A — Retrain after one hour
GROUP B — Retrain after six hours
GROUP C — Retrain after twelve hours
GROUP D — Retrain after eighteen hours
GROUP E — Retrain after twenty-four hours
The average rates and standard deviations of the above regime are:

DISCUSSION
Studies to investigate the possible correlation between size (wet weight) and
the rate of habituation have shown that the extreme variability of rate
cannot be attributed to size (see diagram.7). Similar studies show that
this variability cannot be attributed to tidal cycle or day-night cycle.
In some cases it is possible that experimental conditions such as residual
sulfuric acid may have contributed to the variability of a few organisms.
C. spirabrancha is highly thigmotactic. When worms are allowed to
remain in their mucous-substrate burrow they are less reactive. Shedding
of the burrow apparently stimulates the search for suitable substrate
as most organisms attempt to burrow in the small amount of sand on the
