INTRODUCTION
Habituation in marine worms is well documented. "Sedentaria or
tubiculous worms have been shown to habituate to tactile stimuli,
varying light intensities, and mechanical shock (Nicol, 1950). Detailed
studies on the nereid polychaetes (Clark, 1960, a, b) have shown
habituation to be a characteristic of "errantia" behavior. Habituation
of the withdrawal reflex has been viewed as a mechanism for resuming
normal behavior despite the presence of a continuous danger signal
(Nicol, 1950).
The cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia spirabrancha is found
beneath the surface of the sand in flexible tubes of substrate particles
embedded in a mucous matrix. The worm does not appear to possess discrete
photoreceptors. It is sensitive to sudden mechanical shock, and tactile
stimuli. The withdrawal reflex of C. spirabrancha to mechanical vibration
has been successfully habituated. Retention of habituation was shown to be
present 1 hour after initial habituation. When tested 6 hours after initial habituatior
there was no noticeable retention of the initial habituation. There is a great deal
of variation among individuals in the rate of habituation tovibrational stimuli.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The organisms used in this experiment were collected in the interÂ¬
tidal mud under the Monterey Municipal pier at Monterey, Calif. on
April 22, 1968. The worms were individually cultured in petri dishes
which were submerged on a sea table and supplied with a constant flow
of aereated water. A layer of five to ten millimeters of black sand
from the natural habitat was placed in each petri dish to simulate
the natural environment. One group of worms was allowed to live at
least one month under laboratory conditions before it was used in
