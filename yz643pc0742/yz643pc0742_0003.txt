RESULTS
1. Response Characteristics.
There is a great deal of variability evident in the worm's
response to the stimulus. The degree, duration, and speed of contraction
is extremeley variable. The anterior region, particularly the prostomium,
appears to be unusually sensitive in comparison with the rest of the
body. This is particularly true when the worm has extended the anterior
portion of its body and is actively probing or searching the trough
with its snout. Mild tactile stimulation with a blunt glass rod of the
snout and prostomium in comparison with similar stimulation of mid and
hind parts of the animal support the observation that the prostomial
region is the most sensitive part of the body.
Contraction in response to the stimulus is easily differentiated
from normal body movements in that the contractions are initiated
during or immediately after the stimulus, are pronounced and rapid
in movement, and are almost always followed by a rapid recovery to the
original posture. The recovery period is slower than the contraction
but in most cases faster than the interval between stimuli. Normal
body movements are generally slow and deliberate with a tendency for
M.
the body to slowly contract toward the head in a moving animal.
2. Rate of Initial Habituation.
Ten laboratory worms took an average of 65.3 trials to reach
complete habituation. Standard deviation for the laboratory worms
was 14.1 trials. As a control, ten fresh worms were tested with
an average of 69.0 trials to reach criterion. Standard deviation for
the fresh worms was 4l.1 trials.
