bottom of the trough. Even though the trough provides some measure of
security it is possible that the response of the worm to this strange
environment is abnormal. The difficulties of observations in the
natural sand environment make controls of this type infeasible thus
it must in some measure be assumed that behavior in the trough is not
distorted as compared to natural behavior.
Cirriformia spirabrancha appears to have no active predators
during the spring (Judd, 1968). The withdrawal reflex can be interpreted
not so much as a means of preventing predation but of maintaining itself
in the sand environment. Field observations show that a slight disturbance
of the sand above the worm will bring about immediate withdrawal of the
tentacles. Natural disturbances such as those brought about by the
rushing surf frequently move great volumes of the substrate. Self preservation
of Cirriformia would necessitate a means of detecting and then avoiding
an unstable environment above. Habituation to variable but innocuous
turbulence is also necessary to continue its normal functions.
When the data on retention of habituation Ã¥re subjected to the
standard t test a significant difference in the rate of habituation
at the 95% confidence interval for Group A is observed. This indicates
that there is a definite retention of the habituated response lasting
at least one hour after the worms vare initially tested. For the remaining
groups there there is no significant difference noted with thet test.
This indicates that retention of the habituated response had disappeared
during the subsequent time intervals.
